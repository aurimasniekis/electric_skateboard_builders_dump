I don't know bout Australia but here in California and a lot of other states there's a power limit of 1000 watts ad 20mph. Complete board companies already blatantly advertise higher power and speed and maybe they would claim its intended for private property if it became an issue, (Maybe it never does).   i wonder will this have two power modes or something to keep within the limits or maybe just see what happens and add further to the power and speed claims.

Claiming the "most powerful" will be hard to do with a dual drive hub motor board when acton just released their plan for their 4wd board. So I'm curious if you went 4wd also (doubtful, but...).

theyre illegal period in some states.  I cant find a good compilation.

this is a start:
https://electricscooterparts.com/laws.html
but even then it's hard to find answers.

luckily it's now legal in cali, up to 1000watts and 20 mph at least.  I've been pulled over twice anyway.  cops dont know the laws and generally dont crack down around the country but all it takes is a scary story on the 6 oclock news and it will be the next big danger.

Where did you see a 1000wh limit? I read the law and only saw wording related to speed, which was 15mph not 20mph.

Other parts of the law:
* must wear helmet
* can ride in street if speed limit is <=35
* can ride in bike trails/lanes
* must have lights for night riding

Here's a snippet from the law:

ive read different things as well

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/electric-698363-law-vehicles.html

"averaging 1000 watts"  that makes no sense.

313.5. An ‚Äúelectrically motorized board‚Äù is any wheeled device that has a floorboard designed to be stood upon when riding that is not greater than 60 inches deep and 18 inches wide, is designed to transport only one person, and has an electric propulsion system averaging less than 1,000 watts, the maximum speed of which, when powered solely by a propulsion system on a paved level surface, is no more than 20 miles per hour. The device may be designed to also be powered by human propulsion.

So I guess it's just bikeways/highways that are 15mph max. Kind of dumb..

More Horse power/watt/Motors would be way to Energy consuming. Weight gets higher, price gets higher = not good

More speed is not safe. (The fastest board is 105 kmh).

i think if youre over 1000 youre into another category  . powered boards or something with greater restrictions.  like a moped or something

looking at the law @Namasaki it has been amended to death.  at least I can only get a 250$ ticket for riding trashed drunk and stoned.

If you don't meat this definition, the law says your board is defined as a motorized skateboard, not an electric skateboard. The law also has a clause which reaffirms that motorized skateboards are still illegal.

Maybe I'll put together a post breaking this law down. It took me hours to read this law carefully and actually understand it.

http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21968

This is the original law that banned motorized skateboards on roads in CA in 1959. This new law carved out an exception to a prohibition on motorized skateboards (the link shows the amendment)  legalizing them in CA on 1/1/2016. So, electric boards that don't fall in the definition of 313.5 aren't road legal in CA.

EDIT: for clarity

Ya it's the same here in NYC, usually the cops will throw a fuss if you ride unsafe and is a show off. I did notice an increase trend of people riding their BB without a helmet.

Would love to see some sort of **"tires"** on this thing. Doing 20+MPH on public roads and sidewalks takes a ton of concentration with regular skateboard wheels (at least where I live, bad roads), not to mention the loud typical skateboard wheels sound (especially over concrete slab sidewalks) and the intense vibrations that make your feet tired and cause screws to come loose. There will be a hit in range and acceleration, but I think it would be a lot more fun and safe if the wheels were softer. 

Pneumatic wheels, which I've never tried, seem like a ton of fun, but perhaps overkill if you're rarely riding off-road. Plus, you have to worry about tire pressure and getting a flat. And I've read there's less control/response.

Since hubs don't allow you to change gearing, it would be dope if you could design hubs with a ratio suitable for something like a 90-97mm polyurethane wheels as well as ~100mm+ 'soft' tire wheels...(wish I knew what to call them ha)

Love the integrated handle. Wish it didn't extend the width dimensions of the board. I would definitely use that as a mounting point for a bike lock. 

And while I'm at it, I NEVER use the kicktail. To me, it just adds weight and makes the board longer than it needs to be. Perhaps you should take some polls - we're your market ;)

Keep it up!

Hummie's new tires solve this issue. Made from car tire rubber, they are grippier, have less vibrations than polyurethane wheels, and overall, feel much better. He's the only one I've seen even trying car tire rubber wheels.

@Hummie why not adjusting the power output and max speed to 1000 Watts and 20 Mph. If it is only imporatnzt how much power the board puts out at the moment the police checks you then it would be fine.
If it is important what the manufactor of the board advertises then you can't do much about it.
But you also can go faster than 20 MpH with 1000 Watts. Just change the gearing and you can do at least 25 Mph.

I'm not trying to get within the law just curious how companies advertise speeds and power that's often illegal on roads.    Maybe its just like lamborghinis or something...they can go crazy fast and advertised as such but not legal to do

@Blasto it's nitrile and hydrogenated nitrile rubber.  typical car stuff...at least the non-hydrogenated.  
not as good rebound and other physical properties on paper as pu but rides great and typical pu will degrade and also have worse mechanical properties at temps stated as above 170f.   got "hot pour" pu recently though intended for high heat that I havent gotten around to pouring and more excited about that.

Claiming the "most powerful" will be hard

Not really hard, Most powerful could mean a few things. 

1. Biggest battery in wh
2. Highest voltage battery 
3. Highest battery current 
4. Highest current throughput per motor
5. Highest current throughput overall

We offer the best of the all above. Except maybe voltage, need more market data to confirm. Most likely on par with others.

1.biggest battery would be most energy
2.highest voltage doesnt mean highest power (static electricity is filled with volts but little power)
3. neither does current
4.etc
5.etc
highest power would have to literally mean most power...volts x amps..no?

but then half of what companies advertise is emptiness.  just read the eon board charges while you push it.

I'd assume peak power would be measured as the highest current x voltage a setup can muster before something breaks. Of course the watt ratings for most boards seem to be mostly theoretical and therefore bullshit.

Looks like Jacob's Hubs with a splash of BIG bearing frenzy from Hummies' and the thane/can design from the early CarvON tech demos from a few years back.

If you release something publicly, you only have 12 months to file for a patent (in the US)

However, in many countries there is no grace period.  If you want international rights, you have to apply for a patent before you ever show it off to the public

The handle looks to be in the middle between the wheels.
This makes no sense as the center of gravity is further back, with the motors being far heavier than the front wheels. Bad engineering ;)

The handle opening is actually about two hand widths. 

This allows the raptor 2 owner to slide their grip to the perfect carrying position that best suits their preference.

Great engineering.

who would not want to carry it perfectly at the center of gravity? Making the handle this wide is thus unnecessary. With that logic you should have made the handle as wide as ther entire deck as apparently "wider is better" ;)
But I get it - you also need space for your feet so you compromised and also made it look good by being symmetrical.

I suppose if you had a set of small, Poorly designed, hub motors that all the Chinese boards all seem to have now you probably need four of them to get decent performance levels. 

However if you build your hub motors from the ground up. Jam the biggest stator, best magnets and the most copper possible inside. Then Power it by an upgraded vesc that can handle high current throughput you only need two of them....

Infact for lightweights you could get away with just one of the NEW R-SPEC "GHOST" motors.

You don't need 4 hubs.... Unless they are just not very good. It's also worth noting that ride comfort would be serverly diminished with all four wheels having minimal urethane.

I will be making videos that clearly demonstrate how properly engineered hub motors can offer high torqure for hill climbing and also easily reach high speed without busting a sweet.

You say it is bad engineering on a flawed argument. One, the handle is in the middle, but it is wide enough where it can be gripped towards the rear of the deck. Two, sure the hubs are heavier, however, the battery placement is more towards the front.

Edit: also, it is not like the GT where the motors are wayyy in the back. I grip the GT close to the middle, a little bit further back, but not by a lot. The battery does help counter the center of gravity quite a bit.

Not true. I think it feels great, especially with hummies new car tire rubber. Have you even tried 4wd? If that's really the case for your hubs, then there's problem, cause I feel like I'm floating on a cloud.

I agree, 4wd shouldn't be necessary, but my understanding Jason is you live in a pretty flat area and your not on the heavier side.When John gets on my board, there's way more torque then he knows what to do with, cause he's 60 pounds lighter than me. You always built the perfect product for you, but that's not always the perfect for everyone. I'm curious what the torque and top speed will be like. I'd be surprised if you had the torque and top speed that I have with my 4wd. Either way, @hummies bigger motors should be on par, if not, more powerful than these. Most people seem to be fine with his current dual drive motors...

The new R-SPEC GHOST direct drive motors use the same size stator, although different configuration, as found in the big boy 6374 motors.. they also have double the magnet volume.... they have sensors too for super smooth start up... so yeah they are very powerful.

Imagine dual R-SPEC 6374.... that's the easiest way to think about it.

Also we are not really going to be restricted by current (although it will be capped at an optimised level) becasue the new VESCX, New BMS design & Battery can easily provide a healthy burst of 40a to each motor without concern. Balancing torque and efficincy will take some tweaking however we are very confident.

We will be conducting multiple tests over the course of the next 7 months demonstrating the performance and it will be all shown in our new vlog series starting soon.

We are in the process of building an eboard dyno based on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDfVvS9io3o

We will be doing extensive testing of all the various hub motors we can get our hands on & will publish the data.

We'll start off by running about 1.6kw into each hub & monitoring performance & temps. YES, It's our goal to be the most powerful & we will easily accomplish that based on what we already know is available in the market. However we won't forget about other important factors, we also want a very effecient & natural feeling propulsion system.

Fortunatley @Ackmaniac has developed an awesome way to control power during different throttle stages. This is awesome news as we can now ensure the power is available were it is needed the most and balance that with average crusing RPM. 

People must remind themselves with hub motors you have exceptional coasting ability, on flats at cruising speed you dont need lots of current, you actually want minimal... just enough to fight wind resistance and maintain speed. 

However when the steeper inclines appear you want to be able to hit the throttle hard and pump maximum power into the motors.

We are also using sensored motors so starting will be very easy. However somtimes its nice to get to top speed very rapidly, but not so rapidly you fall over, so you also want to make sure you can have the correct current/power to speed ratio at low rpm. It's a fine that we will perfect over the next 7 months.

How do you know this? My experience so far with hubs is that you need a lot more amps to achieve the same result as a belt drive system. 80-90 kv is perfect for most people (too slow for me, which is why I think 110-115 kv would be perfect for me), and I would get about the same top speed as your raptor if I used 90mm wheels (with 80-90 kv dual drive that is).

However, I have found that, even with cold motors (at room temperature), I can pull 80 amps burst that turns into about 60 continuous with a 4wd on a hill which was 21% grade, while maintaining a speed about 22 mph. If your motors can plow up a 21% grade hill at 22 mph, I would be very impressed...

Those rspec big boys guys are powerful with, but you'll get the same effect of 1.5 of those motors or maybe less. Still powerful, but I wonder HOW powerful... Maybe if you gave us more specs and info?

The other issue is battery sag. How do you deal with sag? When I pull 60 amps con on a 12s4p LG HE2, I sag pretty heavily. And the space cell is smaller, I it would only be worse. This is one of the biggest issues I've had, since the best solution is just a larger battery pack, but it's hard to keep the board thin with a 12s6p, lol.

Here is the direct drive motor we have developed. We are calling it the R-SPEC GHOST (death of the motor mount?) We increased the inside bearing to its maximum size to improve durability & longevity, this also alows maximum surface area for the core to dissipate heat. This is a very big motor, its equivlent to dual R-SPEC 6374 motors (but one that's on steroids & with sensors)  Plus with the NEW VESCX we can easily feed it the power it needs to perform without heat issues.

Boosted dual plus 46.15 sec from center line  from speed. 
Raptor single drive 39.07 sec from centerine from speed.
The Raptor Dual drive should still hold its own against the new Raptor V2 till we see some new video tests.  Be interesting to see how the new direct drives will go for all the criterias - top speed,  range,  reliability.  I can see where its going as theres that potential for that other hub pneumatic wheel option with this set up. Well at least if we have longer truck set up to clear board with the bigger wheel.

when the number of pros outweighs the cons the decision is easy.....

_i wrote this on reddit, it's sort of the same question:_

> _The biggest problem with hub motors is not really the hub motor itself (it's super important though)... It's got a lot to do with all the other systems that need to work with it to make it great. Firstly you need a motor controller that can handle higher current throughput, we now have VESCX. Next, you need bigger batteries & BMS that can handle more current, we now have that. Then you need a custom made hub motor, with precision engineering and innovative cooling systems so you can pump current into them without thermal shut down. We have solved the problems and now we are building it._

No offense Jason, but this seems to be how enertion works. They always have the best technology and when they see a new technology, they bash it until they have time to develop it on their own, then it's the great new technology. It's about keeping the image up that they have the best stuff on the market. It's brilliant marketing. But yea, I remember him specifically bashing the carvons I was trying to use with his vescs. He said something to the affect that hes amazed to even see hubs working at all, even for a brief period until both vescs feel apart the second day.

Anyways, I'm curious to see how these compare vs hummies new hubs. 3x the stator and copper, much bigger magnets, just in a different shape than these.

I just can't wait for 2017... Should be a hell of a year @onloop. Chakas free ride deck, your new raptor and motors, hummies new motors, I'm working on putting together a complete, and a lot more...

hubs are clearly the future, it's just a matter of addressing a couple of their issues. with those solved, about the only disadvantage to a belt driven motor is no longer having the ability to adjust gearing - but even that could be figured out. i'd say the pros far outweigh the cons. 

and to those in the USA concerned about the legality of these boards with regards to wattage and top speed...seriously? i'll take as many watts and mph as i can get, and ride on the roads allllll dayyyy.

love the decision to use a lower cost board with a separate battery enclosure. this obviously lowers the cost of entry, but more importantly, it allows us to use our own boards, which is probably the most frustrating thing when looking at pre-made boards. everyone has their own preferences with board shapes/lengths/materials; you can't please 'em all. 

i can definitely see HI5BER getting a lot of business from people wanting a unique shape and wanting to shed some weight at the same time and just moving all the parts onto one of those boards (assuming it's possible with the way the wires are routed through the trucks).

I'm sure you have and I know you want to and are innovating. For that, I respect you. You also market very well. Saying more powerful is clever, as for the reasons you outlined. Again, smart marketing. I personally can give a rats ass about marketing. I just care about the product. I will abuse (within the expected use of the product) everything until breaking point, just to find bugs. I will never sell a product that I'm not 99% or higher sure will work well.

Talking to hummie about getting molds made, ect. Some molds are 5k+ USD, and getting motors machine is not cheap either. And you can run everything through formulas, but  you don't really know for sure how it will perform until you have them build it and you try it. This often means you will need to do multiple iterations to work out bugs and create a solid motor. I respect your journey, and I hope to play a hand in testing stuff. I'm excited to try a vesc-x and see how it performs compared to a chaka vesc and a chaka vesc with heatsink.

I think it is how most businesses work, for better or worse. Although there are alternative ways (like the one you might be following). Either way,  being a savvy business owner is sometimes overlooked by some of the DIY-turned-business crew (thinking the Jacob hub thread disaster). I also think Enertion is learning pretty quickly, which is one of the advantages of the learn by doing approach. The downside being the hits you take when something doesn't quite work the way you expect.  

I agree too, 2017 is shaping up to be the year of the eSk8.builders vendors. Next year will have a lot of great options for the DIY scene, and even more blurring between the commercial guys and the guys spinning (increasingly) solid business in here. 

This is all the exciting part of such a relatively new field- constant innovation, and evolution in approaches to the problems. 

The pics look great- much better colour scheme and a great look all round.

about the only disadvantage to a belt driven motor is no longer having the ability to adjust gearing

Hi, I think less urethane is also a disadvantage for comfort but it's a trade-off if we want the simplicity of the hub motor and get rid of the belt.

Oh yeah, forgot about that. Having a thin wheel and creating a hard ride is definitely an issue for hub motors. I imagine there's an ideal ratio between hub size and wheel thickness. On the bright side, almost all of the weight is coming from the motor, and the more motor the more power. Also, the bigger the motor, the larger the wheel; easier to roll over stuff. I'm sure we'll eventually have swappable wheels for hub motors.

Already working on this with hummie. I'm trying to convince him to make 90mm, 97mm, and 107mm wheels also. Each of his wheels can be replaced in less than 1 minute per wheel, super easy, no bearings, spacers, ect. Just 6 screws, a plate, and then they pop off.

I hope enertion takes the same route, as it's an easy way to adjust torque and top speed with hubs.

97-107mm changeable wheels with Hubs is the future, you roll over everything in urban commutes, go for it.

The Ghost 90mm is ok but 80a is too hard. This is good for roads in australia but not for shitty sidewalks. (it's illegal to ride on the road in most european countries)

this 80a is actually very soft - equivalent to kegel, you can see me bend it with my fingers.

Its similar to flywheel 75a / orangutang kegel 80a

I'm confused. I've ridden 75a abecs and 80a kegels and the abecs are much softer but ok...

Your Instavid is the front-wheel but on the backwheel there is much less urethan to make it soft. We will see how these wheels turn out in real city environment, the bigger the better, the softer the better, the more torque the better. Whoever comes closes to this is a winner and will get my money. :slight_smile:

Damn @onloop. I literally just bought my Raptor a couple weeks ago and now I have to buy a new one. Raptor 2 is looking awesome! And here I spent too many hours on my raptor getting everything black on mine. Nice to know I won't have to do that on this new one. Trucks look way better black than that electric baby blue or whatever it is.

Yeah it's always a tricky subject when releasing new products. That's is one of the reasons why doing such a long presales campaign is a good move. I don't want to leave people feeling high and dry.

I fully understand for people who buy product and learn of a new one hitting the market soon after its a downer. However the new raptor is still 6 months away so at least you can shred the streets.

In fact many people are still asking for the old raptor now. But we are totally sold out. 

I suppose you can now think of the raptor 1 as a collectors edition now.

Also. Don't forget to sign up to the referal program and you could earn enough commission to buy the raptor 2 also.

1. You can share your affiliate link anywhere and if someone buys a raptor 2 you earn commission. 
2. Important: For the friend to get a discount they need your discount code. enter during check out.
3. If you use the built-in "SHARE BUTTONS" I have already pre-written a nice message that includes the discount code & the referral link. This is the best way as it all happens with one click.

We will start selling the product at the low price (enter code during checkout to get the super low VIP price) however, there is limited qty at each price level, so as we sell-through the price goes up. 

The idea is to reward the early birds!

**Here is a timeline to show how we think the sales will progress.**

* LEVEL 1 > 10 units only > Sold out instantly. First 5 mins
* LEVEL 2 > 20 units only > Sold out first few hours. 1 day
* LEVEL 3 > 80 units only > Sold out over the next 30 days
* LEVEL 4 > 95 units only > Sold out over next 60 days


We are not really sure what will happen after LEVEL 4


**_We also have a counter on the raptor 2 site that will be updated each day to show the number of raptor 2 sold so far_**

Raptor 2: 1532 Eur - 2x155 Eur VESC-X - 100 Eur Deck - 44 Eur Remote - 400 Eur Battery - 100 Front-Truck and Shit= 678 Eur

Our plan is to send a container to EU with the raptor 2 inside & duties pre-paid..... what your government/customs does from there is not in our control. International logistics is complex. In most cases, you don't pay anything extra. However, if you are in Switzerland or UK you might. It depends if your country is part of EU in may 2017

We are not responsible for any fees or charges that may arise, my advice is if you are unsure don't buy it.

after further analysis there is a good chance the hub motors won't be available on their own & if they are it will be a long while away.

Here some things to consider.
1. these hub motors need the precision trucks to work.
2. therefore, you will probably want the front matching truck & therefore also be buying our front wheels  (which is recommended as they are awesome)
3. You need dual VESCX or better (better doesn't exist yet)
4. You need a good battery & BMS that can throughput the current.

So this kit is about $1599

$899 SPACE CELL X (inc vescx x2, RX/tx)
$249 PRECISION TRUCKS
$50 FRONT WHEELS
$399 HUB MOTORS

Now the issue is we then need sperate packaging, we need to create documentation on how to build it, we need to offer customer support when people can't figure it out....

so we might as well just sell the complete skateboard.

maybe i can set a limit, its just so hard to monitor it....  orders can be placed simultaneously on my website.... & each order can take a few seconds to load on my screen, so i could be in the process of cancelling an order and 10 more could appear with the same issue....

the first 10 will basically go within seconds... 

my focus will be trying to change the price from LEVEL 1 to LEVEL 2 at the exact correct time.....

Which is why I mean that you should just do it "after the storm". Any order with say more than 2 will  simply not be fulfilled and retroactively cancelled - let people know that and nobody will try as they know that they will just end up with no raptor at all.

Thank you Jason for confirming what I've been trying to convince the community of for a while. 

Wood decks feel more natural than carbon fiber decks. This is why I'm investing the money into a proper hydraulic press, to make my hollow channel decks. Like I've said before, I've been up to 38 mph officially with one of my decks, and I know much higher off the books without even a bit of speed wobble or chatter. 100% stable. I can't say I would feel safe at those speeds on a carbon fiber deck. It just doesn't rebound the same way to the curves and debris in the road.

Keep it full price, let everyone see the promo codes for each stage, then you can set limits to each promo code like 1 per user and only 10 promo codes to use. Just food for thought but there may be people that want to purchase one for their partner or friend??

Saw your new video about (don't) sellings parts separately, some of your points are valid and I understand that but some are not.
When I already have a Space Cell and VESC-X then I just want to upgrade my board and don't wan't to buy a complete new one. I may have to install a bigger fuse on the SP4 and put Hubmotors on, thats it. I don't care about matching front-trucks.

I understand that you won't sell the Hubs before the release of the Raptor 2, because then everbody can build their own Raptor 2 before official release.

But please don't move away from DIY, ok, there are other DIY-vendors out there but they still have to catch up.

Well... as usual there are multiple parts to this answer.

1. The US factory that makes the nee R-SPEC GHOST wheel does not make wheels with core used in the flywheels.... they have the core they use for kegal wheels.

2. I also prefer the kegal core aesthetically as it is a better design for matching with my hub motors.... 

3. Also. There are wheel pulleys that fit the kegal core... so people can still use this for diy esk8 .

We are also using sensored motors so starting will be very easy. However somtimes its nice to get to top speed very rapidly, but not so rapidly you fall over, so you also want to make sure you can have the correct current/power to speed ratio at low rpm. It's a fine that we will perfect over the next 7 months.

There may actually be some sensored hubs out there but i haven't found any and if you can find them, I highly doubt they will be quality hubs.  They've been on my wish list for some time.

I think it's a good call to only sell complete boards for now. Focus on great customer service, quick fulfillment, and scaling. The more you profit, the more R&D you can do, the more bulk you can purchase...this means a better product at a lower price for consumers. 

As a Raptor owner, even if I wanted to avoid having to buy a Raptor 2 complete and instead buy the parts, I'd literally be buying everything except the new deck to make it work. The deck is probably $100 and the complete Raptor 2 will be cheaper than buying all the parts individually, so it just makes way more sense to buy the whole board and sell or save the deck as a backup if I want my own deck.

It seems to me there is an easy way to avoid someone abusing the discounts on pre-orders: List the item on the website at full retail, and apply discounts (manually) to get the final price AFTER checkout, based on the timing of the order.  In other words, if the retail is $1699, the first 10 orders get a single (1) $800 discount applied.  This makes the effective/final price of the first Raptor 2 in that order $899.  Any other Raptor 2's in the first order at full retail.

So what if someone wanted 2 (legitimately)?  Place ANOTHER order!!!  And whatever place in line you have will net you the associated discount.  Simple.  Easy.  No live pricing changes necessary.

And since all discounts are applied manually, it would be very easy to spot any abuse and take appropriate action.

Hey Jason. If you're going for stealth, wouldn't it be better to have no handles, I haven't had a handle for my dual raptor and it hasn't been a problem. Or offer it as an option, seeing as it's going to be a wood deck, cost might be an issue.

Keep it really plain on top of the deck, and to make the component box less conspicuous.

## \#238 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-11-19T00:40:36.224Z Reads: 327

```

the handles are multifunctional. 

1. they make the board super easy to pick up & carry, load into your car etc. If you ever travel with your esk8 you know this is really very important and i am seriously surprised other vendors are not offering quick grab handles.

2. It's also anti theft, allows the board to be locked up more securely if needed or strapped to your backpack as you can feed through the handle to secure in place. We will use red thread locker on the screws so you can't easily remove the handles.

3. the handles are also a structural component. they give rigidity to the board ensuring optimum responsiveness at high speeds.

I believe that when designing esk8 you need to blend practical functionality & performance... It is one reason we like the kicktail so much... it serves so many purposes... manoeuvring busy city streets that have various cracks & debris, quick on the spot turns/pivots, also to kick the board up to your hand. ALSO do some tricks.

Longboard already exist for a long time, why didn't they add any handle feature ? 
I'd say that people don't like the aesthetics of having a gap on their deck, I guess that's why it didn't break through on the longboard  market.

Typically you'll be riding your board instead of carrying it anyways, right ?

The only reason I would want the handle is for the locking feature.
This might just be my opinion, but i guess there is a reason why longboards didn't adapt to this feature...

@onloop been very busy the last few weeks and didnt really check here daily (sometimes not even weekly) ... gotta say though, after reading and watching the things about your raptor 2: Im really impressed by this product and Im actually tempted to try to get one for 899$, which seems like a real bargain considering the sum of the parts.

very consequent innovations - vesc x makes a lot of sense, the hub motors look very interesting, your own designed precision truck is a real suprise move ... and a pretty awesome one. the trucks look really sweet and the cooling fins is a great touch! wonder how they ride?

I was never a fan of the old raptors lid, and now its gone! would really like to see a finished raptor 2 with routed in enclosure!

also really love the colors (or well, lack of since its all black!), was always really unhappy about the all blue enertion product line. 

thumbs up, it looks like a really cool product! the only thing that could be slightly improved for my sense of aesthetics is the enclosure. glossy black plastic doesnt look too great directly next to anodized precision trucks and carbon board surfaces imo!

Constant errors during checkout attempts. Inventory not available, then just "error loading this step of the checkout" please try again. Kept happening halfway through shipping and payment forcing me to have to start over. Pretty frustrating. Finally capped off by all my credit cards being declined due to uncharacteristic international spending. A Paypal option would have been a very useful solution. I'm out for this round. Looks like a great board. Have fun you lucky bastards.

## Thanks for the support! 

**I am very thankful for all your orders. We will now focus hard to make the most awesome electric skateboard on the planet.**

I would also like to ask respectfully, please refrain from emailing our support team requesting to get the Raptor 2 at reduced prices, this was an extremely hot offer & the first 10 sold under 30Seconds we cannot offer this price no matter what your reason.

We are very sorry to everyone who missed out.

Wow that's great.  I'm 8038.  I hope that means my board is one of the first Raptor 2 boards shipped.  I have been dreaming of a sensored hub motor set up forever, but couldn't find a set that I thought would be good on any level, heat, energy, or longevity.  I see all the work that went into the truck design to dissipate heat, along with your motor design and am glad you made these hub motors sensored.  Cheers, can't wait !

What does this mean for those of us who went for your original promotion? Will we be able to purchase the Vulture Deck from Enertion directly? Advertising this as an  Kickstarter exclusive will rub many of your customers the wrong way, especially after being led to believe this was a one time promotion. I get where you're coming from with bulk purchases; however, many won't. In terms of Raptor2 vs Vulture Deck, this should have been offered as an option between one of the two, when ordering in your first promotion. Perhaps this can still be done by contacting customers and asking for their individual preference. Just food for thought anyway.

Funny guy. I wrote it in a rush first of all I could have worded it better ("one time deal"). And that's how it was promoted. Eitherway it is a good deal I'm not denying that. 

Keep in mind  the price listed on his Kickstarter for one unit  is at level 3 VIP price of the original offer, which is already supposed to be sold out. Offering an Kickstarter exclusive deck days after the original deal, when people already pre-ordered  and weren't given the same option will not fair well for some.  This is how it is worded anyway.[quote="onloop, post:373, topic:12694, full:true"]

As a pre-order buyer It is concerning to see a revised board design option involving **additional cost** being released so soon after pre-order.

I'm hoping Enertions development of Raptor 2 over the next 6 months is not going to end up being an **exercise in marketing** where the original board concept which buyers signed up to at pre-order,  is lost  to a number of design improvements being charged as "optional extras"

Hi Vinni, this is an optional extra, it is available to anyone who chooses to go onto kickstart and select it.

Everyone who purchased a RAPTOR 2 in Campaign #1 can access this offer, it will get shipped with the Raptor 2.

After the Kickstarter campaign the product will be available on the enertion website to order at its normal retail price.

Please explain your concerns so i can help you better.

In the meantime, please think about the Vulture Option as just a deck! this is not a complete electric skateboard, it requires the parts from the raptor 2, the end user is then required to build it at home.

As a successful campaign #1 buyer you can also buy this VULTURE DECK on Kickstarter, it will be shipped with your raptor 2 order that you ordered from the enertion website.

Yeah that is fairly standard these days, let's just say I wouldn't want to be replying those emails either :D.
Maybe it also a good idea offering an upgrade option for those who prefer the Vulture, on your site. Not everyone will want two boards straight off the bat, and I'm guessing the production cost is higher for the Vulture. Personally I'm sticking to the original design, until it needs replacing.

Never heard someone measure Max Rated Watts in Watt hours. This number also assumes you will have 0 sag, which is not true. Those cells sag to 3.8 at 80 amps, so your max watts is really 3040 watts (not Wh, lol). It will be physically impossible for you to ever pull 3360 watts, since in the real world, you have sag.

If I were to calculate it like you, I would have 4032 watts max power, meaning I have the most powerful direct drive board :open_mouth:

It's also worth noting that pulse current draws of up to 95A per cell for <500milliseconds have been documented on e-cig forums. e.g. So why not say 15.9kw peak power in the first millisecond?

my point is unless we start timing voltage sag in seconds the max number could actually be much higher than what has been quoted above I have simply used the commonly known max rated specifications.

I've been an e-cig user for about 5 years now, and have every mod under the sun (mechs, diy boxes, old vv/vw, tc, etc.) and i can tell you, we've done some pretty stupid stuff over the years, i would take anything you read on an e-cig forum with a pinch of salt (not to say there aren't good and reliable sources of info/data, cause there are, people like Phill Busardo does a lot of reasearch). Yes, you can probably draw 95A or more from a 25r, is it wise? definitely not. Thats why you see these kids getting their hands and faces blown up in cloud comps.

EDIT: btw, voltage sag isn't that much of an issue on an ecig where you hit for a few seconds, but on an eboard where you might be going uphill for a few seconds to a few minutes, it is.

A 95 amp draw from a single cell would be practically a short.  The voltage in such a situation would be a fraction of a volt. It's a good example to use though as when calculating the power output you'd multiply that 95 amps by that fraction of a volt not by 3.7 or 4.2.  Your cell would also be toast

I'm sure you understand how it works and there's a lot of businesses that probably do similar math to get inflated numbers but if you put a watt meter on the board it would show the reality.  But we're sticklers for real math being a somewhat science community and not just a sales platform. So we have to keep it real
The speed you state is also not real given other tests done with similarly powered motors and kv and voltage.  How bout put out a video showing a speed test or the board's esc readout?  When will you have a motor we could see?

These guys are both well established members and have plenty of experience on here and I've seen both of them explain lots of stuff on here when I first started out and I found a lot of it useful. Hummie for a longer time but  I'm recently seeing hevoayax on here but he's involved in helping out but that is besides the point.  This is the type of condescending comment that would get flagged in any other post if it's made towards you or your products. In fact it's insulting if you ask me.   Please lead by example, don't make comments that you would flag if they weren't made by you.

Do you actually have a motor though!!? @onloop 
Really it's stunning how you sucked them all in and you seem to not even have a motor.  I imagine if you had one we would've all seen it by now. 
There's that question and the age old how big is your stator?  We can figure out all the details of a comparison now for the fun of it but it seems you don't want to

I don't think it's accurate to think of sag in terms of time as a variable.
Main contributing factor of sag is based on internal resistance of the cell, as soon as you pull current out, you will see the drop (across internal resistance)  the drop is INSTANTANEOUS (disregarding inductance)

The reason they are rating these in terms of time (95A <0.5sec) is you're burning tons of watts across that resistance internally so it's a thermal issue.  Not that "and then after time _x_ volts won't be as good"

How many JOULES can your 18650 package dissipate.  Maybe you can mitigate this by a couple percent with clever thermal management of your battery pack/case but internally the power is just huge and difficult to get rid of.
  
Warmer cells actually perform better (lower resistance) but much warmer than warm and you're damaging the battery, we already know this.
Note how the times change - 40A for 5 sec, 30A 6 sec, basically current squared it what's being dissipated across a (relatively constant) internal resistance.  Keep the joules low = keep internal temp low.

Also I find the comments hilarious and encourage the competition, we should all be fact-checking each other's science and we should all be trying to make a better design than the next guy.  While also taking the best ideas from the community and building on them :-)  The better esk8s get, we all win

Describes my feelings exactly. To some degree, we have to solve our own issues. But when we see possible problems in each others designs, I don't see why we would should point them out. Then by the end of this, we both have great boards and the community at large wins.

We can all make claims, but we will have to see with scientific tests. I would like to see more science behind claims in general. Again, this is why I built the VESC Vision app. This gives me a platform to build tools for specific tests with the vescs data so that we can glean into what's happening better in the real world, so development can be improved.

For example, how does weight affect current draw and range? Maybe a guy who weighs 100 lb will get 25 miles, and the guy who weights 200 will get 15 miles... Right now, all manufacturers give 1 number. I don't think this should be the case, as the real worlds tests I've done show weight (besides hills) is one of the biggest factors in range. This should also affect amp draws, as it takes more energy to more 200 lb than 100 lb.

The problem is, to what degree do we want to sort this forum. I think the problem with creating a separate topic for power discussions is that these 2 thread go hand and hand. If we have 2 threads, there's some overlap of both. I think the power discussion is relevant to the rest of the discussion of this board, and moving it out of here makes it more complicated to reply to comments made here. Just because someone says something here, that I need to mention something about the power system in response to, I need to reply to it in the power system thread?

I'll leave this up to the mods, but It seems to me these 2 discussions overlap, and splitting it makes it more confusing and difficult to respond to...

I'd agree. I believe the power discussion was started due to marketing claims, which I believe is relevant in this thread. Maybe a good compromise is to provide a little more detail on the claims without going in depth (or maybe linking to an in-depth source).

I agree with @CSN. Something in the same vein as the Ollin hill climb which is more reflective of what happens in real life - it's not like in real life you drive to a hill with a full charge, go up it, and then pack it up and leave. Usually the hills are mixed into your ride. The weight seems about right though - that's how much I weigh when I commute.  

The climb is still pretty impressive on HUBS and the weight. To give Jason the benefit of the doubt, I don't think he intentionally is deceiving, just using an app and maybe forgetting what he posted in his old videos.

It's possible for a hill to have varying grades of steepness.

In my early video i used Google earth to take elevation. Then I simply calculated the average gradient. 

In this video I walk to where the hill gets steep and got a spot reading.

I am not getting defensive jinra, I am simply answering the question you asked, you said this: 
> Can anyone explain this?

So I explained it...  how is this being defensive?

Here some more explaining.... 

This is the data from google earth used in the boosted board video
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/5/051f9fd4ba3caac0692de3ac052fc4f554379922.jpg" width="690" height="340">



You can clearly see there is an error in google earth, it says the hill has a small drop off in it, which it doesnt, **hence why it makes sense to use a local measurement**,

Furthermore if you remove the error from google earth and simply calculate using the first half of the hill, it gives this result which is very similar to the phone reading.

**So it would seem 17% is pretty darn close to accurate.**

here is the google map data for your own reference....

For the curious. I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you were flooring the throttle on both of these runs because I dont see why he wouldnt be. I'm also assuming the start position is about the same place for all 3 of these runs because it looks fairly close to just that.  For everyone **please take note that he's 16 kg (35 lbs) heavier on the raptor 2 video** before you start commenting about the relative times. I'm gonna say very impressive once that's taken into acount. I have no stake in this matter so I think it's a very fair (or as fair as it can be considering the extra weight) comparison as I did my best to sync the starts of the climbs. Tried doing another vs the raptor dual but couldnt find a video of Jason using it on the same hill. There was one video of the Raptor mono drive and Boosted Dual but he doesnt start from a stopped position judging from how quickly he comes into frame so that would not be a fair comparison.

So, my biggest question about the Raptor 2 is the battery and electronics enclosure. From the videos I've seen it looks relatively flimsy, and appears to be made out of some kind of plastic. Now I know, not all plastics are bad, and having some flexibility under the board (that will bow slightly) is a must, but I'm particularly worried about:

The screws holding the enclosure onto the board pulling through/cracking the plastic, resulting in the enclosure falling onto the ground.

Or,

The durability of the enclosure, to handle a direct impact of a rock or curb strike.

Otherwise this board looks amazing, and I can't wait to get my hands on it.

The enclosure is also a concern for us. In fact we are still developing this part. We have tried aluminium and also carbon fiber previously.

Plastic is actually a very good choice. It's very strong and offers excellent impact resistance. Plus its light weight too. Specifically we will use fire retardant ABS.

It also worth noting the case on boosted board is plastic too. Same with fendors on most modern cars.

It is definatly possible to get it looking good. Once the finishing touches are finalised I think most people will see it the quality.

Why is this a concern?  The space cell Pro enclosure is just that and no one's had it fall off their boards as far as I'm aware of. And so are most enclosures on here too for that matter. Both DIY and commercially available. With the exception of a few who use fibreglass. 

Also the pattern you see on the enclosure serves two purposes,  it's a design choice but it also adds a lot of structural integrity to the material to help it deal with impacts of road debris.  I don't think this is a real concern you should be too worried about.

Oh so it did happen. 

I've never seen one of these up close but did it fall off because when you over tightened the screws,  they pulled through the plastic? Or cracked the plastic around the screw head allowing it to come loose? 

Because if that is the case a metal insert at these locations or applying the clamping force over a larger area using a washer would mitigate this

@onloop Any chance you have anymore photos or renders of the Vulture Board, perhaps with trucks and wheels attached?  I've seen the few photos on the kickstarter page, however they really only show the bottom of the board. Just trying to get a better idea for the shape.

Thanks!

## \#497 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-12-14T01:20:32.686Z Reads: 243

```
11wh per kilometer is average use = 32.72km OR **20.33miles** (obviously average use depends on terrain & rider weight)

10% (or more) recovered via regen braking = 36wh Extra is 3.6km OR **2.23Miles** (more hills you recover more, but also use more)

20.33 + 2.23 = **22.56** Miles on battery use alone

Now assume just 10% of the 25mile journey is downhill & no power is used at all (it's very likely that there is more than 10% downhill in most journeys)

## 22.56 + 2.5 = 25.06Miles

NOTE: it might be possible to get more but we are being conservative.

On this one i have to agree with @onloop, on all of my rides that i tracked checking VESC status after the ride i've been getting on average 10% regen, doesn't matter if it's a ride around the block or a full battery drain ride with some nasty hills on the way, the same works for consumption, doesn't matter the route i get between 8 and 9 Wh/Km (not raptor)

Based on those numbers you're highlighting, you're looking at 16miles I would think?

(36Wh - 5.4Wh) / 2.2km = 13.9Wh / KM

A Samsung 25R 10S4P pack is 360Wh so:

360/13.9 = 25.89km

25.89km is around 16 miles

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. @onloop doesn't have his production samples yet so he's providing calculations on the data that he has available.
When he gets his samples and is able to test his calculations I'm sure he'll provide us with the updated results. If this is lower than what he was expecting we'll probably hear about it.

25 miles might be expecting too much, but nobody can say that for sure until there's even a prototype :)

Seems like everyone that hasn't purchased a Raptor 2 or what @onloop says gives too many fucks about it too soon. I say, if you haven't spent the money, who fucking cares? It's like me telling every piece of shit that bought a Kia Optima when they first made a decent car (you're not really a piece of shit if you bought one) that they were wrong and to look at the actual specs. They were waaaaay off when they released. But look at them now. Selling a shitload of cars. Quality cars at that now. I feel sick saying that too. Why hasn't anyone thought to wait until this Raptor 2 is released? It seems weird and way too far into speculation at this point. I have a software engineering degree from almost a decade ago and it's almost irreverent in today's standards. Things change guys. Let's wait and see. 

P.S- I bought a Raptor 2. And a Raptor 1. Who cares? Not me. If I don't like it... I will sell it to someone who will. It's the handshake of passing something on to others. I've had a ton of good experiences with @onloop and Enertion. He has good ideas and sells good products as far as I'm concerned. :)

Wait hahahahahahaha did he do his battery calculations including percentage of regen braking and then just "assume" one would have 10% of his journey downhill, just to get those 2,5 miles for marketing? Do you realise that if one does the same route daily he would also have to do that 10% incline the opposite way, consuming more energy? Let's be honest: a 10s4p won't give you 25 miles. More likely 30km. @onloop, instead of pumping out crazy high numbers just for marketing, keep the official specs low and blow them up when the product you release is way better than expected. And stop that comparison BS and focus on your own product, you even put the mellow board there, and 1) it's not even out yet, 2) they specified they will have many different batteries, the 99Wh is just for the standard-easy to travel with setup. Not to talk about the specs of the motor you haven't even received yet. I appreciate your work and if it wasn't for you I probably wouldn't even be thinking about esk8s, but you should wait a little more before promising something. If I'm not wrong, very few people were able to get the promised range on the raptor 1 (if you reader are one of those, write it down here please)

What range do you get on your 10S4P Samsung 25r battery with Dual Hub motors?  Would Love to see some data from your real world tests.

When i ride there is always a percentage of the journey where i am rolling... especially when i go down hill. Even on flats you can roll quite a distance due to the limit resistance offered from a direct drive system.

You do realise that Everyone WILL be different. If you have more hills you have a different result. If you weight more you have a different result. If you ride into wind you have different result. If you have soft wheels you have different result. If you are fat you have a different result. If you accelerate hard always you have different result. If you use beginner mode you have different result. If you change max current settings you have different result. If you wear baggy clothing you have a different result. If you ride full tuck you have a different result. If you ride at full speed you will have a different result.

There are so many variables involved!

If you still have doubts that range is altered depending on the environment variables you can go do your own tests using a combination of those variables and you might learn how to optimise your ride....

My numbers are based on my own environment and real world tests, if you don't like the results that's fine too.

I fully understand that there is a huge variety of variables that can affect the range that you'll get on any given board. That's fairly obvious.

I'm only commenting based on my own experience that I've had with several different battery and motor setups, along with riding various different routes in different conditions and from my own experience at least, I've never managed to get close to 25miles on a single charge with dual motors and a 10s4p battery.

While the raptor 2 has a lot of similarities to my board, there are obviously also has a lot of differences but it seems to be fairly commonly spoken on these forums that hub motors generally don't get as much range as a geared motors.

If you end up being able to get 25miles on a charge like you've claimed then I think that's absolutely awesome. Either way, when you've got a board that's ready, and the final design is finished, I'm sure you'll be looking to provide the community with some real world data from the final product and prove any skeptics wrong. 
Regardless, the Raptor 2 looks to be coming along nicely and I'm looking forward to seeing some videos of the final product :)

Haven't read such magnificent bs in a while. The last paragraph from trendhunter:
> The 'Raptor 2' features a rechargeable hand piece that controls the operation of the skateboard to ensure that users are always in total control of the unit. An electronic Regen brake system is outfitted on the 'Raptor 2' powered skateboards to ensure that quick stops are possible with ease.

LOL. What? This is some real innovation right there. Never has it been possible to ALWAYS be in TOTAL control. This is magic! Oh my. Quick stops? Another amazing innovation!

If you still have doubts that range is altered depending on the environment variables you can go do your own tests using a combination of those variables and you might learn how to optimise your ride....
[/quote]
No man, you used valuable stats from your (probably valid) tests. Then you added completely random variables like that 10% incline. You can't use that in "scientific" tests. That way I could take a 6s 2500mAh battery with a single 5065 and say "it goes 60mph and has a range of 250 miles" and specify "if used downhill on a 45% incline for 95% of the ride". That is just BS for marketing, and you know that, cause you didn't even try to argue to my last comment, but you keep trying to defend your statements with this "test it by yourself" that doesn't mean anything. I could test it by myself assuming my daily route has 10% uphill and that would take 5 miles out of your "scientific" test. The only people who can get 25 miles out of that are 50kg ones riding without wind at the same perfect speed without stopping (bye bye miles added from supposed regenerative brakes), with maybe some downhill (which is actually bad, cause assuming it's a daily route you will have to repeat that part uphill to come back). Since your average consumer is not 50kg and has some hills to climb (hill climbing ability is a big part of your marketing), that range is false advertising. The end. 
That said, I hope the raptor 2 goes well, it's still many steps ahead from the rest of the market, even with 15 miles range.

for a perfectly tuned single belt drive with the best bearings and avg tall/heavy guy, 9Wh/km on flats is possible, if i ride slow its usually 10Wh/km, if i push average its 13Wh/km. 

11wh/km and then substracting 10% is pretty much the same as saying 10Wh/km, which i dont think is a reasonable real world testing number for a dual hub system.

but then again, none of the companies give avg use real world range. its all very hypothetical constant & slow riding on flat ground. so why would enertion give real world data when nobody else is?

I get your distaste with these numbers but I don't think Jason is doing anything wrong. Belonging to this community as a seller can be damaging at times since members are held to a higher different standard than others. The question is, should Jason be forced to tie one arm behind his back when competing with other brands just to appease forum members? Instead, shouldn't the forum be supporting one of its own? Jason's decision point is to either look less competitive relative to other boards and potentially lose out on sales or gain brownie points on this forum by meeting some intangible standard. If you ran a business, had people depending on you for income, what option would you choose? 

There obviously are lines of integrity that are too far to cross and this isn't one of them - saying that you can get 25 miles on a 10s4p is not a lie, it may be unlikely but it's not a lie (as an aside, personally, I've gotten over that range on a 10S4P mono drive going very slow and I weigh a lot). If your job is selling your job is to shine the best light on the object you're selling and assume optimal conditions. If your job is a that of a scientist or technician your job is to be more conservative. As a one man show Jason has to wear all of these hats which I think people are characterizing as shady, it's not, it's him doing the best job he can in each role.

You're right, I just think this market needs to be a bit more realistic, if we want esks to be considered a valuable vehicle for transportation. If I was one who knew nothing about esk8s and wanted one to go to work, needing 12 miles forth and 12 back, and bought this for that reason, I would be upset. If then jason want to say that anyway for marketing purposes I get it, it's his own job. But don't come here with "scientific tests" with random variables. Just say "it can get up to 25 miles in optimal conditions" and comparison labels for uninformed people will use that number

Yeah, it's a constant balance between selling and managing expectations. Every business is like this though, you have to sell to stay alive and get close enough to your sales promise that you get repeat customers - a Big Mac you see in a commercial will never look like one you get at a drive-through but it's close enough.

I think this is also about crafting messages for your audience. On this forum conservative answers on specs are always better received and may actually help your sales. On kickstarter it can mean lost sales.

Regarding the esk8 market as a whole, the one company that I think is pretty accurate about their range is boosted, stating 6-7 miles which is definitely conservative (personally I think they could say 7-10 like others). I've ridden with my friend 5-6 times who has one and that range has been pretty spot on when riding full throttle so I'm sure he could go further if we were riding slower. I rarely see boosted getting praised or making sales for being honest about their range, it's actually been an achilles of theirs.

Boosted is actually a good example of marketing done the right way. They have a crazy low range but they don't even try to fake it, and people still buy it a lot because of the great customer support and reliability. Range is short, but you know that from the start. Raptor 2 doesn't even have to fake anything, even claiming 15 miles could probably beat competitors on paper, so I don't see the point. If one's purchase is affected by range that much (and it doesn't seem so, seeing the success of boosted), then the range must be accurate. If that's not, people who buy it for that reason become unhappy customers. And that's worse.

This is a piss poor excuse no matter what manufacturer says it.  The fact is WE DO KNOW how long batteries last. Because people here have access to hub motors and access to 10S4P batteries and they, the people of your forum who build their own boards and are not fooled by propaganda unlike the generic public will not buy your outlandish claims because we know better.

We, and when I say we I mean others who are more familiar with hub motors, who have spent a longer time making them and riding them and getting results from them than you and you are choosing to ignore it and deny it. I for one dont give a rats ass about how far your board goes ("Oh you dont care then why are you commenting if you dont care?" - your next comment. Because this is an open forum and every member is entitled to their opinion and you're likely lying to others about performance of your product according to many on here). I will likely never get one but I do care about honesty on here. If it's true range is 18, 20, 23, or X then just say so and just openly acknowledge that there is a drop in distance because you wanted to go with some sick ass hub motors you personally designed and they are the best ones because of this performance data we collected under several different settings and simulations which are repeatable results.Just say you went with the new hub design versus the belt drive because reasons A, B and C and you feel that's enough justification and if that doesnt fly with you then your product is not for them. 

I hope your new hubs preform as you expect if not better or there will be a lot of new unsatisfied enertion customer's.

1) take a ruler and discover it
2) measure it and divide by 2
3) do many tests in common conditions and don't add 10% of incline randomly
4) do it and calculate how much money is missing from your wallet 
All of these can be calculated, if you don't add variables "assuming you do something"

But you need to stop responding to community members like this. It's not right to let your anger get the best of you in your responses.

Not to tell you how to run a buissness, because I obviously have no experience compared to you, but I believe PR is one, if not the, most important part of a company. So please, stop insulting people and either answer professionally and kindly, or don't respond at all.

I disagree that anyone here is being insulted! If they are that's certainly not my objective & if people are feeling insulted from the discussions that take place on this thread or forum they should probably go somewhere else. 

In reality, It's just a bunch of people with strong opinions, mixed with some arrogance & stubbornness and likely some hidden commercial interests.

If you go back and look at my replies, You will see I have answered questions objectively & in detail. I have spent more time trying to be nice & address people's accusations than any other electric skateboard company ever has & I will keep responding and providing extreme amounts of details about my products. 

Whether people believe my published specifications or not & whether they choose to publicly disagree or not is not my concern & I have no control over that. I will continue to be very open & transparent about my business & products and with that comes a realness that you will not get from any other company in this space, so like it or hate it i am not planning on changing who I am or how I communicate in order to appease a minority of folks who are overly sensitive to this kind of transparency & honesty.

The real problem here is that some people love to argue endlessly about infinite things just for the fun of it. Why not skip the arguments & simply **provide some evidence clearly proving that it is impossible for an electric skateboard to travel 25miles on 360wh battery?**. That would quickly prove their point and I would be forced to change my specs but nobody has bothered.

The counter argument from these folks should be the same, prove that you _**can**_ do it. Well, that is my Intention. Also, I will be delivering the product in a few months to hundreds of people so there will be plenty of data too. In fact with optimization 30miles might be possible.



Anyway thanks for your concern.

I also like this forum, but I wasn't expecting its prime splash image to be devoted to the raptor 2. feels like the 2000s when Microsoft was shoving internet explorer in our faces simply by using windows. I get it that this forum is maintained by you, however you said it yourself this is a place of open-platform and open-source electric-skateboard building, but putting your raptor 2 on the front page feels.. counter to that. like establishing a sort of superiority that isn't the same as back in the day with the showdown between your R-SPEC and the other motors especially TB's motors. I was on your side then because the images and proof was there. but now you're using that prime imagery (spot) for your business. you're treading on middle ground, and I do realize this forum is free too..

Enertion's factory likely has a deal where they aren't allowed to sell to others as is typical.  Knowing what temp you're motor can get to shouldn't be a secret as it defines what the motor can do. It does it and is fine or it's cooked
Knowing the details of what's inside is the only way to make an informed decision when buying.  Max or continuous wattage number and supposed speed are empty nuzmbers for marketing its been shown. If you want to know what you're really getting and what it can do, and if the seller really wants you to know what the motor can do, then you can know with those numbers .  Look at top motor manufacturers like hacker or scorpion or others.  I can't help but be cynical with the magical numbers presented by board companies

Ok. Is it wrong to ask for one number, just one. What's the continuous wattage and how is it gotten? 

I'm not a hater I would just like it if on the forum we could talk reality about products.  If a claim is made about most powerful can we know what that wattage is?  Assuming most motors are the same to get that number you really have to know what the magnet temp ability is.  God forbid someone really wants to know what the claimed most powerful motor can really do.  It's main selling point is thst it's the most powerful and we're supposed to not ask!?

We question claims made by the many other companies is enertion immune?

This is how I look at this situation. It's both building and selling. It's cool to ask detail question, but if you're not getting an answer, don't complain and cry. Ask the person personally via pm, maybe the information is just not meant to be disclosed to the public.

The forum initial purpose was to help build - assemble esk8 from hobby parts. It's also not meant to justify wether one product better than the other or marketplace and or building a specific motor in particular. I really don't want to know the exact details of the little pieces within the motor, how to assemble your own motor and to get the 100% perfection. It's good to know, but it would provide less interest for people who just get started.

The details I have provided so far have been dismissed as "Marketing BS" anyway.... Most of you guys seem to have hidden motives.
[/quote]

You know, as long as you keep adding random variables to "scientific" tests it's obvious that we can't take you seriously. I don't have any secret motive, I haven't even bought from an esk8 shop yet, it's just that I can't stand fake marketing from people who don't need it. You're the only one that can't backup your arguments with science. You just said "my battery tests are good, if you don't agree show me yours". First, if they are that good show the video of the full 25/30 miles ride. Second, don't suppose people have 10% of downhill. People buy your product based on that, you're the only one who needs confirmations. By the way, you just said "loser" to an athlete that made it to the Olympics finals, I'm just going to leave this here. You are smart though, flame posts here work like light for moths, and I like fire and can't look away

questioning what power the "most powerful" can do is not asking a trade secret or too detailed a question. Maybe it got its continuous wattage numbers in the arctic at sub zero temps and customers will be bummed when they try to do those numbers presented, in hot Australia, and then destroy the motor when they over-cook the unknown magnets going up a mountain.  Knowing these things are practical and the most important things to know.   With a car knowing max power is maybe interesting, with an electric motor it tells you what you can do before you destroy the magnets.

but i'm really just questioning enertion and jason because he's here on the forum and really i have a problem with the whole industry and lack of any standardization of testing.  when you get a car and it says how many miles per gallon it will do you can compare numbers because they all do keep to a standardized test

Shipping is set for may 2017

The Raptor 2 has motors equivalent in stator size to two Big Boy 6374 motors. 
However, the R-SPEC GHOST Hub Motors have been heavily upgraded with more powerful magnets, thicker magnets, steel body, sensors, etc
So it's a weapon

I have already placed and order back on 11/28 for 2 boards (was one of the first ten) and entered in the discount code, but It only applied the -$100 off for one of the boards (not both). I don‚Äôt know if you could edit this to update both boards to the $899 price. Or if I should ask for a refund and just buy through the kickstarter campaign. Also, I‚Äôm not sure if kickstarter charges you a fee for the boards you sell. I would be more than happy just to give Enertion my extra money directly for the extra 5 boards I‚Äôm looking to purchase (on top of the original 2)

So in the end looking for 7 boards total, all to be shipped to Vail, CO. Also, since all boards are being shipped to the same location, was wondering if there was a way to combined shipping boxes to bring the shipping costs down. I totally understand if it‚Äôs not possible since you are shipping from Australia (I‚Äôm just poor though so I thought I‚Äôd ask).

I love what you guys are doing and can‚Äôt wait to see the final product in May. I wish everyone at Enertion happy holidays and the best of luck over the next 5 months.

Firstly, thanks for the order, & congrats on being so fast!
From memory i set the the code up to limit discount to max $100USD per order. So technically you needed to place two separate orders & apply the code twice. Anyway, We should be able to fix this up for you so you get the discount on both.

Regarding the shipping prices, they are already as low as we can go. YES, Sending bulk does make things slightly cheaper sometimes, but because these items are so big it is based on volume too. In most cases we will be subsidizing the freight. 

Kickstarter take 7%, so technically it is better to pay me direct :slight_smile:

But our website is not setup for these special deals. I suppose you could buy 5 & then we refund the difference. Otherwise just head to KS and help us get closer to our first stretch goal!

Hope this helps

THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT

So just checked the CC and only have enough space to buy 4. 4 boards plus shipping comes out to $5221.53 (only got $5750 space left on my cad). Instead of sending me a full refund, you can just apply that to the 5th raptor board I'm looking to buy, plus the difference in price:

So each board would cost $899 + $46.64 (fixed shipping) is $945.64 per board. 
$945.64 multiplied by 7 boards comes out to $6,619.48 (total cost). 
My first invoice (order #8041) was for $2007.26. This new order for 4 boards will be $5221.53 
$5221.53 plus the 2007.26 equals a total of $7228.79. 
So $7228.79 (what i will have payed) minus $6619.48 equals a refund of $609.31
So in the end I should be getting 7 boards and be refunded $609.31 (just to confirm) 
If all looks right I place the order for the 4 boards now. Thanks

Sneak peek at the New Raptor 2 Battery form factor.

We developed custom 18650 cell holders that provide additional structure to the pack and also protect the welds. This makes pack building much faster & results in a very compact unit with high energy density, whilst also offering simple user replaceability. 

All of the battery control circuitry is sperate from the cells, so swapping switches and replacing parts is very quick, minimal if any soldering required!

I went up to what like felt under 40km-h, but i would like to have gps data to back that. Even at that speed it did not feel comfortable (safe) with all the rocks and salt on the streets

On the bench top speed in foc was 41km-h, in bldc was 45km-h. Might suggest to @onloop to up the kv a bit, these guys have plenty of torque. I was fully braced for the acceleration and still slightly lost balance.

The dyno should be in in the next couple of weeks, that will set a good bench mark

Great video and love to see the app video *high five* These are the kind of uses I was hoping to see, because now, I can tell by looking at the video that the battery (assuming its the space cell) sagged from 40 volts down to 30 volts under acceleration, and that this is the kind of sag I talked about and was concerned about before. I don't want to start any arguments about that again. Just pointing out it's awesome to see my app getting used :P

btw, the temp is wrong because it's a small error in the conversion fro F to C. I have fixed it, but I need to fully check everything works before I upload the new version that fixes some bugs and adds some new features also.

The pack i was using is slapped together 10S3P with used makita drill cells. Not the best example, but wanted to share the excitement.

We are still deciding the best control method... Current or possibly Watt. Either way it will be tuned with custom throttle curves for the ultimate start up silkiness with a very obvious underlying raw power that you will never find in other complete esk8s who have a tentative approach to performance.

There will also be several user presets that can be set via phone app or PC.  Or just make your own preset to suit your style.

People should always remember that the Raptor 2 motor controller platform is built on open source software that can be modded to your hearts content.

Correct.. the outer edges are the same width... although thinking about it, its going to be hard to transfer these trucks to other boards... Think about it.  Not only are the wheels large, but they come so close to the center that there will be no cutout for it on a normal board.
This kind of sucks for me, as I have a dropdeck longboard that I would love to use this on. I think a dropdeck is ideal for an electric board as it gives you a ramp on the front and rear for acceleration and braking grip... so you can stop harder without flying off the board. lol.

But looking at the first real pics of it.... I realize this isnt going to be possible unless I add pockets to the board.

To create a better seal against liquid ingress we have positioned the LCD on the roadside with the other peripherals. Much easier to seal when there are less holes. Bit more stealthy too.

There are also some really nice apps out now that have very nice data for range & battery level etc. If possible we would like to include a BT module inside every raptor 2 so that the apps can be used.

Someone claims the Raptor 2 is the most powerfull Direct Drive Board, yeah whatever...
I tried to figure out what that means and if that is true, so I did some nerdy stuff.

The Ghost-Motors are 1150 max watt each I think?

So you can calculate the Force the Board is putting to the street like this:
"RPM" => "Max Motor Power" => "Motor Torque" => "25% loss to Heat" => "Gearing" => "Wheel RPM/Torque" => "Wheel Diameter" => "Force"
For the Raptor 2 this about 194 N (Newton), is that good?

In the second step I tried to calculated what is the max incline a 100kg guy can keep it's speed (no acceleration) running uphill full power (the motor runs on max watt output)
With no loss to friction, it's about 19% incline.

This calculation is far away from beeing exact, but you can compare it to the other boards out there to proof the claim. 

Direct-Drive-Boards: (based on marketing specs)
194 N (19%) Raptor 2
167 N (16%) Carvon EVO4
153 N (15%) Mellow
134 N (13%) Inboard
121 N (12%) Stary
117 N (11%) Acton QU4TRO
111 N (11%) Carvon EVO
80 N (8%) Genesis    
41 N (4%) Blink Lite

This looks good for the Raptor on paper, lets see if it can perform in real live, can't wait to see a video of Jason doing a hill test :)
Acton is pretty weak with their 4 motors, but this is mostly to their big wheels and 400W motors or I did something wrong :thinking:

Belt-Systems: (based on marketing specs)
288 N (28%) Raptor Dual    
268 N (26%) Ollin Freeride
243 N (24%) Metroboard Dual
192 N (19%) Raptor Mono
191 N (18%) Evolve GT
144 N (14%) Boosted Dual+
84 N (8%) Zboard 2
53 N (5%) Evolve Gen2
53 N (5%) E-Go

P.S. my Board (Dual-R-Spec and 15:48 gearing) is at 324 N

For calculation I used this tool, I wrote lately. It has a few issues but you can see how eboard physics works

I have recently found longboarding and will probably get my first eboard. I have looked up Evolve GT and find it really nice, but since the price is quite expensive I am not going for that even if I like the setup with swapable wheels and such. 
Will Raptor 2 be swapable wheels in the future?
Is there a friendly beginner mode on the board?
I think I am more of a glider then a speedster, will this board suite me?
What range could I get if I just glide around in mid speed? Iam 180 cm and 90 kg if thats important

For now this is all my questions.

Is this board suited for beginners?
yes and no... on one hand, you can keep the throttle switch in the "half" mode... this means that wide ope throttle is only half throttle, and its easier to modulate... If you're electrically inclined, you can also program the VESC to be easier to ride.
that said.. you will fall. at first it will be starting out and braking... but you will get that quick.
but thats when the trouble starts...imagine you have a mountain bike, and you pedal it as fast as you can. then imagine the bike suddenly disappears. this is a normal beginner electric skateboard fall. it will happen. If you know how to fall in general, and you wear your gear... you will be fine. if you think "i got this" thats when this kind of fall  happens... so if you're the type of person that will not wear their gear.. no. its not for you. it just goes too fast too easily. if you're unusually responsible, then sure... it can work as a first board.

Will Raptor 2 be swapable wheels in the future?
the motor wheels are replaceable, but its unlikely you will have many options. all terrain wheels are possible for the future, but you're not going to be swapping from the stock black wheels to diffrent colors or sizes anytime soon.

Is there a friendly beginner mode on the board? 
there is a switch that will make the throttle max out at 50%... so its easier to modulate.

I think I am more of a glider then a speedster, will this board suite me?
yes, but the stock remote isnt as comfortable at part throttle as some others... but you can swap it to almost any other throttle, and add cruise control... so if it doesnt work out, you can change it. you're not stuck with the throttle it comes with.


What range could I get if I just glide around in mid speed? Iam 180 cm and 90 kg if thats important
everything I said so far goes along with what @onloop said. this is where we disagree. I think that if you glide around mid speed you will get  18-20miles. he claims much higher, but based off other vehicles using the same batteries, that is my personal expectation.

What is the length of the battery box?

I am considering adding a Raptor 2 to my quiver and using a vintage deck such as a 36" Sims Taperkick.

I am looking forward to reviews and videos of the production boards.

This board looks like it will be outstanding.

Best of luck to the Enertion team and to the early adopters.

At least you will need 660mm wheel base.

the case is 545mm

Thank you for the rapid reply.

Since I don't have a metric tape measure, (and for those who need to do the math such as myself) 660mm is 25.984 inches and 545mm is 21.456 inches.

It looks like this would work if I moved each truck about an inch (25.4mm) to extend the wheelbase to 660mm.

It would be really nice to have a vintage deck with a modern power system. Kind of like a classic car with a turbocharged, fuel injected engine.

Its not just wattage... or horsepower...
Performance is also how they are controlled..... sooo.

Are you implying that you worked the throttle curve to be buttery-smooth like a boosted board? 
Are you saying you have the cutouts of the board deeper so you can carve without risers under them?

In car terms.. are you saying you made a sports car instead of a muscle car?

or is it performance because you are using more voltage and current with an equally efficient motor to make more power?

I understand your response is a joke but I was drawing attention to the tone of your reply. I'm giving you genuine useful feedback on something others have seen but no one has addressed.  You've gone ahead and posted it to your instagram 2 days ago as well and that also means you're exposing this mistake to a lot of people, your current 2000+ followers and more importantly potentially thousands more of your new potential customers and followers on there. If people are seeing your posts as suggested content then they probably also see other's like Evolve's, Boosted's and Ollin's posts and their adverts dont have such glaring mistakes up for 2 days with it going unnoticed.(all be it boosted did have that whole batteries catching fire issue recently..) 

By replying with a joke and disregarding the point of the post which is pointing out there is a blatantly obvious mistake that should be fixed you're discrediting the serious issue here which is you come off as if you have no idea what you're talking about in this one post which just so happens to be an advert for your brand new product and your company which is why I dont see this as a laughing matter.  It's about your public image and that reflects the work you put into this huge endeavor. If I'm reading that and it makes no any sense whatsoever than what am I to think about the people's work who made it and the products they put out? Maybe the forum members wont say anything, we know you put out some good shit but it reads like those bad Chinese translations from knock off products and for those who dont know the quality of work you put out they will make assumptions about it because thats what we do as consumers. What if thats the one post that they see first and lost interest because of it? Ive ranted longer than I meant to but I'm just saying you're potential customers are seeing that, so in my mind 2 days is too long for that to have been up and you not to have noticed and fixed it. it's not a joking matter it's your livelihood.

no no, I'm okay with harsh fucked up jokes. The issue here is that this is an advert which is publicly posted for all to see. If it was just a text post fuck it, I wouldnt have said shit but what the issue is here is that it's representing his company and it's doing a piss poor job of it. He puts out good products but if the labeling is wrong it's going to turn off potential consumers. THAT IS THE ISSUE.  That is why i dont see it as a joking matter. it is much easier to keep up a public image that try to gain it back. In one of my marketing classes we discussed the effectiveness of marketing and in terms of advertising dollars its something like every 1 dollar spent on keeping up a public image of  a company is just as affecting as 7 dollars trying to grow it. This typo is costing him big time with respect to new potential customers.

ok, thanks for the concern! I really do appreciate it.... I barely attended English class during school. Was busy skateboarding.

However, I think you are in error, This is a quote & an illeism. The copywriter, who is me, is quoting myself describing what i did.

when engineering precision mechanical parts I realized I could achieve greater performance. 

So my point is people should learn how to engineer something. Becasue, there is no innovation otherwise.... Be an engineer, Sit down and think about what could be improved, be inventive... do things that nobody else is doing.... & if you do you might just achieve something truly amazing.

Okay this makes perfect sense in this context so my bad for harping on you that hard. Knowing this I can see clearly what is off here. The reason this works in this context is because here you are talking about the past explicitly. This entire sentence is in past tense. In your poster you have used "is" twice which is present tense and then in then throws in a "when" which is inherently a past tense adverb whose present tense is "while" but here it's being used as a conjunction, bringing together the ideas of true performance and engineering precision mechanics. So as I read this even now that I'm trying to explain it it's messing with my head. The issue here is its ambiguous as to which is meant without that context you provided afterwards. I think that's also because this sentence makes just as much if not more sense if it's all in present tense as "True performance is only achieved **_while_** engineering precision mechanics" So if you're looking to deliver the same message then you should replace when with while, then that would fix the confusion.

I think the biggest issue though is the perspective from which it's written. In your poster we, the end user , are the ones reading it and the rider will not be doing any precision engineering through which we'll achieve true performance. So it makes a ton of sense from your perspective and as we the end user we will be the beneficiaries of that but it's not something that as an end user can be related to without that context right away. You get what I mean, in that sense now I totally get where your coming from but I would never have thought of it in that sense unless you had explained it. 

Knowing that now your point is definitely valid but it's not one a consumer may relate to immediately as I didnt. Rather we will be using the board, so it might be something to look into to replaced with a proposition instead   

For example: "True performance is only achieved **_with_** engineer-**_ed_** precision mechanics"  since that is what the consumer will receive, a tangible part vs an experience of engineering a part. Similarly "True performance is only achieved **_through_** engineer-**_ed_** precision mechanics" for the same reasons of receiving the end product which has gone through precision engineering rather than us partaking in the engineering experience itself. It's just more straight forward of a "this is what you're getting statement".

in summary though, I understand your point now with your explanation of how you came up with the phrase but it is just slightly confusion from a end user perspective.

"Electrical motors typically use less than a 100% duty cycle. For example, if a motor runs for one out of 100 seconds, or 1/100 of the time, then, its duty cycle is 1/100, or 1 percent. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is used in a variety of electronic situations, such as power delivery and voltage regulation."

Dude you know what we mean. The important bit is that the battery current is the somewhat "constant" number and thus only this value can be used. The motor current without information about the used duty cycle at that moment is meaningless. Also you already noticed that energy can not be created out of thin air. The motors in this video showed a power of 1230W! Please @Ackmaniac back me up here. - you know these numbers better than anyone.

A better analogy would be: you don't measure the power of combustion by measuring one cylinder and multiplying by the number of cylinders. Reason is that not all cylinders are "active" at the same time. The more reasonable measure would in fact be looking at how much fuel you burn per second (assuming a perfect conversion without losses). You will never be able to get more power out of your combustion than the rate at that you push fuel into the motor.

Maybe double check your article because:
"Watts can be used to measure the instantaneous power output (or input) of a machine, such as the electric motor on your ebike. The number of watts used by an electric motor at any moment equal the voltage supplied by a battery multiplied by the current flowing from the battery to the motor."... witch in our case is 67amp (because the batt current is only a average of what is present on the motor and is not instantaneous)

33 volts X 36 amps is the wattage 

  Maybe there are two motors and the record being shown is just for one.  

Motor amps are pwm as said so just on for a fraction of time and if they were to be averaged through the complete time period, including the off period of the pwm, it'll be 36 amps.

How can a guy with an electronics background like you have so little knowledge about this subject and about how an ESC works? We are derailing this thread and I don't want to continue this - there have been a number of people now telling you you are wrong and you still don't want to believe them. Btw the voltage supplied to the motor is actually what is "adjusted" by the ESC - that means while you can use the 60amps you can't use the full battery voltage. If you use battery voltage to calculate power you also need to use battery current.

with the BSFC known, and the fuel consumption known, you can accurately estimate the power output.
With an electric motor, we know the BSFC equivalent of efficiency for power out for power in. same for the controller... meaning we can estimate the output from the input, but more importantly we know the output will never exceed the input, and therefore know a max limit with 100% system efficiency... and thats all I was pointing out.

bad analogy... given that a flywheel is required to run a motor anyway... you literately are averaging the power of a full engine cycle(or multiple ones) to get the power measurement... you can just multiply as long as the engine is fairly symmetrical...  If I am getting 80hp from 1cyl of my v8 @ 5000rpm, I can figure that as long as I have a similar layout, my engine is making 640hp.

just like if I am putting 3kw into a multiple electric motor system... if all the motors are identical in construction, load and power input... I can say that 3000/ number of motors is a valid 100% max... multiply it by the controller and motor efficentcy and subtract any constant loads like lights or the radio... and you can get closer.... still not perfect, but close enough for what we're doing.

I doubt that - would like to see a simulation on this though. You can't just multiply - they are not firing at the same time so you need to average and include the phase shift the cylinders are working in. This would only work if your 80hp is already an averaged number over the entire cycle ( a 4 stroke engine needs two full "rounds" before it actually uses fuel again)

of course its averaged over the motor cycle...or many cycles... thats how a engines power is measured. if you were to take instantaneous measurements throughout its 720* of motion, most of them would appear negative, as its using power to expel and compress, losing them on intake.. and the greatly exceeding the avg power on its peak of the power stroke. All of them would be useless unless averaged together.
with a brushless dc motor, its no different. you are applying power and taking it away in sync.. and that power itself is slowed by induction, and its never constant. it goes in waves, just like the engine cycle.

I could make one of them put out about 5kw.... but only for so many seconds.
I could have it put out 2kw, but not continuously.
I would guess that with the limited cooling, 1200w continuous seems reasonable (600w each)... but for the punch up to get up to that speed... asking for 2kw for a couple seconds isnt unreasonable.

The key to doing this reliably is just rolling back the max phase amps as the temp climbs. I do the same thing with a Phaserunner on an ebike.

hm, nice, so basically hub motor and belt drive perform about the same - the "kv gearing" is working well - could scrape some acceleration for higher topspeed and they would be equal i guess. thats a pretty nice result!

I found similar results with different gearing and different KV motors - basically there was no real difference between higher kv motors and lower kv motors with comparably taller gearing. just makes sense that these results translate up to the 1:1 gearing of the hub motors.

your hubs are really gigantic, only complain one could have might be the comfort of the thin urethane layer?

True, but isnt that going towards the middle? I also would like to point out, that I didn't post that to blame Enertion in any form, I posted it because a lot of people thought it was fake and this proves that pulling a car with an eskate is possible.

Don't worry... Is just that people are according so much importance to these video, they forget that Esk8 is **all about having fun** , I think these video weren't made to prove something without a doubt, they are most likely to show the product and have fun some with it.

could scrape some acceleration for higher topspeed and they would be equal i guess. thats a pretty nice result!

Yeah we are pretty happy with this result, Our target was to match the Raptor 1 performance, However, i think we will surpass it. getting a batch of motors made now with higher KV, once we start running the higher current from the new power system we should see more torque again & higher top speed. Overall very happy.

Just a quick question from my calculations on your Raptor 2 videos.

From the _Bombing Up-Hill | Will this technology change skateboarding? - Raptor 2 Hill Climb_ video:
Going **uphill** around 900m in 1 minute and 23 seconds leads to a average speed of **39.04 km/h**.

From the _Raptor 2 VS Raptor 1 - Sprint & Lap Tests_ video:
Driving around 400m in the velodrome on a **flat ground** in 40 seconds leads to a average speed of **36 km/h**.

Can you confirm these numbers?
Because you said the uphill video is not speeded up I don't get the point why you are driving uphill faster than on the flat.

No. I haven't talked about top speed at all. A better comparison would be a 100m run vs a 400m run.
From your 100m in 9.58 seconds his average would be around 37,58km/h.
Now you think on 400m he must have a lower average, because his muscles gets tired over time. But compared to the Raptor 2 he would have a not explainable faster average speed. Lets say 400m in 35 seconds, so an average of 41,14km/h. Do you think he can go the 400m faster? :grin:

Be honest... Did you also use Google earth to measure the hill climb distance of 900m...? or maybe you were you the ice addict who turned his head so quickly he dropped his hit coins.... dude! You are a smart guy. Get some solid data or stop trolling.

You have two options right now. 

1. Get some irrefutable evidence and prove me wrong once and for all. Easy right?

OR

2. Accept that what I am doing is ground breaking innovation, its never been done by any human so far on the face of the planet.... 


Also. Please remember you are now on public record. & I do expect an appology when you can't prove me wrong. OR EVERYONE WITH A RAPTOR2 PROVES YOU WRONG.

Honestly. Everyone (haters) needs to take a step back and have long think about the posts they write....

Is this fake/magic tricks? Or is it real? Seriously?

Why the fuck would I risk everything on some lies?

Because IF it's all fake I'm going to be very embarrassed and have zero credibility in a few months when I ship all the raptor 2 to everyone....

That would require 8 more cells. This adds an extra 72mm length in a 4P pack and increases the cost. Also adds some extra weight. Of course I could run 12s3p bit then you end up with a smaller pack. 10s4p is perfect for my design.

I take you very seriously.

1. Wind resistance?
2. Google earth terrain / incline measurement errors?
3. Top speed VS average speed assumptions?
4. Battery voltage?

I assume you worked all this out using some solid formulas? From video and Google earth data? 

Honestly man. You are clearly very bright. But you are not going to achieve anything scrutinizing my work unless you have some facts.

I'm either straight up lying about performance and everyone (maybe even you) will prove me wrong in a matter of months when they receive the product and it doesn't do what I claim it can do.

I'm just making videos and publishing results as they occur in real life.

Did some research on google. Even used yahoo a little.  Found some hard facts. No alternative facts. Hexakopter is a competitor but he's only been able to produce a push skateboard so far. Selling for $29.99 on eBay. Really far behind in manufacturing an eskate. 
But seriously. Don't waste your time with the trolls,smart or not, for now Jason. Focus on the product. We will all see who's right in a few months. You or the skeptics.
As far as I'm concerned even if the board doesn't fully live up to the hype, there's really nothing that compares to it for what I paid for it on kickstarter.
If it does then it's clearly one of,if not, the best board on the market for the price.

Other than that, as @hexakopter does it, the distance traveled and the time taken will show the speed.  Can the start and Ed point be verified using google maps? Where was it done @onloop.  Maybe the raptor goes faster than previously thought?!

I said that I am out, but maybe the basis of the date would be quite useful then. Just for the confirmation of this data you can see the coordinates on these pictures and verify it yourself. For the hill I choose two points noticeable in the video and used the corresponding time. And because the path wasn't set that accurate I just round them to 400m and 900m. Maybe you will get values a little bit off.

Who knows maybe on the hill he was hitting the 50 amp current limit. We need more data before we can call it fake or real.

I attached a Blitz bike light before I got my Shredlights. I have a drop-thru deck, so I mounted it through the cut out for the trucks. Only issue is that it sticks out. So resting your board on it's tail is not possible. Lights were not bad, just need to make sure you mount them in a place where they are protected. The plastic housings break easily. The lights are still $20 a  pop, so personally, I find Shredlights to be more cost efficient in the long run. I've broken too many bike lights that I've mounted on my board.

You cant say this forum doesn't bring up robust duscussions. At the end of the day Enertion have to deliver on their promise. So many kickstarter campaignes have gone no where.

Only 2 months to go before they start rolling out. Then as we all know the claims will either be delivered or not.

It seems like people seem to fall into 1 of 3 catigories:

Hardcore Enertion Fan - You could give them the most irrefutable evidence of something fishy and they will bash you and defend Jason and Enertion. These people hate the hate on enertion and don't understand it. Many have likely never built their own board, and don't have the technical experience of building an eboard, which is why they are looking at completes.

The indifferent - Don't really care about the claims and the authenticity of the claims, just want their board.

The skeptic - Those who have built many boards, worked with this technology, have studied enertion for years and likely used their products with them failing and getting no help from enertion. These people likely fell for the hype at one point, to later realize its a bunch of talking points that really mean nothing, but sound great (like the r-spec motor video).

At the end of the day, I think anyone is way smarter to back the Raptor 2 than say boosted or evolve. Especially for the price, I think this board will be hard to beat. However, lets not kid ourselves by saying this will be the most power direct drive electric skateboard. Maybe for a short time, it will be. But there are many of us working on our own boards, some just DIY guys like me and hummie, some are other companies with more capital. There will be a time when you can pay 2x the price of a raptor for a far more powerful direct drive board. And that day is right around the corner. Can the raptor 2 climb 25% grade hills at 20 mph+? My boards are already doing that without breaking a sweat... Double the motor size soon, and I bet 35% grade hills at 20 mph will be possible. These are feets the raptor 2 will never achieve, because its a consumer grade board. That doesn't mean it's shitty, I bet it'll be a great board for it's price. But it's not a prosumer or professional board.

@onloop you keep hinting that I'm critical of you because I could be in compitition with you. But the truth is, we have 2 different markets. Your in the consumer market, while I'm looking at the prosumer and professional markets. I'm looking at people who want real performance, under any circunstance. People who need to be very good at riding skateboards before riding my boards, because they are just too powerful for the average rider. I hope you create a great board for the masses, it does help grow the community, which great for all of us. But until you show data with your your tests (which btw, I'm more than happy to send you a BT module free of charge for this purpose and my app is free too), I'll remain skeptical of the claims. Your realizing now what I told you months ago about the kv being too low to hit 28 mph is true. You'll find by increasing the kv, you'll get little top speed gains, but will loose a fair amount of torqure. You can either do what you do now, which is argue that idk what I'm talking about and leave this to the expects, ect. ect. Or you can accept that some have more experience in certain areas of building Eboards than you, and are just offering advice so you don't have to waste your time and money building prototypes, just to find you need to tune it the way you were suggested to before hand. But it's your money and time, so have fun building (which I know you are).

P.S. I don't mean to come off sounding arrogant or frustrated. I'm really pretty indifferent right now. I wish enertion the best and would never hope or route for issues with this board. I mention what I do because I see areas of improvement, which is why I am critical at times.

Very well put sit. Completely agree with what you said.

Personally I think this Forum and also what Jason did by starting it is awesome. But as soon as you ad humans to any occasion you end up with messy things here and there.

I am a true believer in the following: "Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence, as long as evidence is not provided such claims should, no even need to be ridiculed and questioned". I think you ment it in the same way ?!

Anyway, I think marketing is definetly a needed tool and reality and wishfull thinking sometimes need to be blured to make it a sucesfull campaign. The problem is that this forum is unlike Facebook or random pages. There are a lot of poeple here that have so much experience in this industry because it is their hobby and turned for a few to a profession or just an everlasting love for e-boarding. And to those poeple It can come across rather insulting when certain claims are question of the probabilty since they know the claimed is an improbability. Further more when they are ridiculed for their critics. 

For me I only talk of what I know, seen and ridden. And before I haven't seen a trustworthy independent review or ridden the board of a close friend myself I wont give an oppinion. But was truly happy to read your post!

Also. If my R-spec motors where just hype? Why is it the most popular motor for esk8? Why are my competitors who build professional esk8 scrambling to source the same motor?

Why do my competitors buy VESCX to build their own products?

And finally...
Why do you keep hyping up your vapourware esk8? Isn't that hypocritical? You complain that I hype my products (which all exist and have proven track record of quality and performance) and you come onto my thread to talk about your vapour ware bullshit board....


Here's my summary.

1. You are deeply hurt Inside because I am clearly dominating in this field that you thought you would be a leader of.
2. You are a smart guy, but very frustrated with yourself for not achieving more in life.
3. You are extremly envious, you wish you had my marketing, design and engineering skills. 


The difference between you an I is; I deliver. I back myself when nobody else will. I never give in. I put it all on the line. I won't settle for mediocre. I'm driven. Have Relentless optimism & Belief that I can achieve seemingly impossibe tasks.

I'm the guy who will win because I don't stop working hard..... You are the guy who spent all his time doing nothing but bitching and got nowhere.

Take this advice. Step up or step away.

You think I'm doing nothing, but I'm just not showing off everything I've done and am doing. You like to hype by spending a bunch of time making videos, while I'm spending that time researching. You know well that prototyping and designs take time. Things are starting to fall into place. You know that dealing with china is necessary, but takes time. Your also closer to china, which probably helps. Shipping times for many small things like heat shrink even can be 30+ days, and impossible to find in person in any store.

Your points are also all wrong, you clearly don't know me. I'm not jealous nor envious. I admire your hard work actually. The only thing you said that's true I wish I had your marketing skills. But that's what friends with marketing degrees are for, so it doesn't bother me.

Now the question is are you willing to set time line and settle this once and for all with a race? I should have a finely tuned board by the end of May. I'm heavier than you, but that won't matter. You keep saying you'll race me, so race me than! Fly out to SF and race on the smooth roads of golden gate park on Sunday June 4th when the park is closed to cars. We'll make an electric skateboarding event, draw people out, great marketing opportunity, eh...

Considering you're the one making the claim that the Raptor 2 is the most powerful direct drive board, shouldn't the onus be on you to prove what you're saying is true? Anything less is simply false advertising.

How many hub motor electric skateboards have you seen go up a long steep hill at speed of 35-40km/h?
How many Hub motor electric skateboard can pull a truck?
How many hub motor electric skateboards can beat a raptor 1 in a sprint?


**If there was a more powerful hub motor electric skateboard why doesn't someone just show it?** 


I've done plenty of "showing" and the torrents of evidence will keep flowing.

I haven't seen any but none of those things specifically prove that the Raptor 2 is the most powerful product on the market. I know of several other companies currently developing hub driven boards but so far, no one has done any direct comparisons so until that happens, we won't really know.

I'm not actually trying to bash the Raptor btw, I actually really like the new design for the electronics enclosure.

You've already seen what i've done with my 4wd rocket board. Now imagine 2x the motor size with sensors and running high performance lipos with a bms which won't sag and will give far better performance than a li-ion pack, especially as the battery drains.

Just a tease, I make my own decks in house. Hallow core. Pressed using our own home built 16 ton hydraulic press. This deck is not yet finished (needs some more sanding and a few layers of polycrylic), but you get the idea.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/7/379d2c0ff30e7cafeadc9fec93a43587ebc824f2.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Video showing the first beta board with motors 1/2 the size of the final motors and li-ion. Lipo performance will be far better:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85uj6IQWCcY

I was the first in this community to do 4wd hub motors that still run as good today as they did 8 months ago. By testing them over a long period of time, we were able to find some minor flaws that may shorten their life slightly that will be fixed in the next design. 3 months of motor testing would not have been enough and I don't think is enough for any hub motor to find this specific problem which will likely be a problem for you also. Final designs need testing for at least 6 months IMO with hard use, probably more.

Everything should be falling into place with the rest of the components that I don't make in house in the next few months. I'm hoping to release a few beta boards by the beginning of the summer for further testing, much like chaka did with his free ride board.

Now are you content enough that I'll have something serious to race you with by June 4th? Should give you time to finally tune your board also.

@cesargrimmelprez What looks ugly? The board in the video and the new one are not the same. Your also looking it the board without the lid.

I also don't photoshop my images to make them look better than they really do. Photos don't capture the same look as real life, unless you photoshop them.

And the argument wasn't about making the sexiest board either, it's about the most powerful direct drive.

There is a 2-3 layer lid that spans the entire length of the deck and the same shape of the deck that covers the top. There's inserts all through out the deck that are used to screw the lid down in place. It's similar to my last deck, but it's a different deck, and the assembly procedure is better so that all the layers line up correctly. Assembly is also a fraction of the time from the last method.

There is no enclosure, just 2 built -in channels for electronics. The deck is very strong and durable. Had mine crash into curbs at 20 mph with nothing more than a scratch. A CF deck would crack and splinter in the same scenario.

We also should get back on topic, since this is about the Raptor 2. Just responding to what Jason asked for...

His latest designs are far superior and being kept under tight raps, so I can't say anything else. But they will be far better than these small ones. You also never had a pair of the non-blue goo motors. That blue goo was a bad idea that caused temps to go higher than they should have. Hill climb on this board already is very good. Sprint test is the place I'm most interested to see the comparison, and is why I want to race.

The other thing is that @onloop, you assume 4wd hubs can't feel good. The carvons feel like your floating on a cloud, due to the ABEC 11's. When we get the tires just right, theres no reason they won't feel as good as the carons do.

Also, I've said this before and will say it again, the VESC-X is not needed for 4wd. 2wd, maybe, but for 4wd, I will never pull more amps than the current v4 vesc's can already do continuously. I'm looking at 150 amps max between the 4 vescs. And that'll be on the steepest hill in San Francisco, which I will do when everything's done. And most of the times, you'll pull under 100 amps.

The next version of hummies motors are much more optimized. You'll have to wait and see (as will we) how much of an affect these optimizations have. But they're looking way better than these little guys, which btw, 4x the little guys are more powerful than the 2x r-spec motors I have in a belt drive...

At least I showed a video with numbers that can't be debated, unlike your videos...

1) I don't need to design my own motors when I can work with someone whose designing them and give my insight when I feel it's necessary.

2) VESCs - how much of the design did you do (drawing things on paper doesn't count (do you even know ki-cad?)) vs. Charles, your vesc-x engineer as he introduced himself to me...

3) BMS - As far we know, you didn't design your bms

4) Battery Packs - Not rocket science here. I'll be designing and building my own battery packs.

**The funniest part of this is that I actually make stuff in my workspace. You just outsource the whole build to china. You don't manufacuer a thing. Your not even going to touch the board before the consumer gets it. I actually build them by hand, the entire assembly, including assembly of the motors**

I am a programmer. I plan to work with the vesc firmware and wire the bms to communicate with the vesc. This will allow more control over the battery. I will be assembling all battery packs myself. All soldering and wiring will be done by ME. My build process will be controlled by me, not left up to some factory in china.

Just how much are you going to be selling your boards for with 4WD? What is your intended unit capacity? Do you have a secured supply chain for all necessary parts? Do you plan on smoothing out the edges for more comfort?

I Don't understand why you are trying to beef with @onloop so much. He has way more experience than you and also a successful business that has sold to tons of people like you. Hes said it time and time again that hes trying to reach the masses like Evolve and BB. Yeah hes using DIY components but it actually benefited the DIY community with greater compitition and designs. You bag on him not touching every aspect of the of the design but here's where you forget, you are a hobbyist moving over to custom high performance boards. He was a small batch producer of fully built DIY boards and is now making the leap to mainstream eboard market. Not only that, hes making some of the faster consumer boards with longer ranges at comparable prices. You say you're indifferent but why are you bitching about things you bought from him? Yeah you could obviously make a faster custom board, but can you make it under $1000? I don't think so.

He did in fact manufacture his boards in house, though. Factories are objectively better at manufacturing as @onloop mentioned. But here's an example, Ford built his first built his vehicle by hand and also built many more custom race cars to order for race teams. Then he started Ford Motor Co to make the model T. He obviously could no longer make cars by his on hands any more and then came the age of automation. I'm just sayin', Apple to Oranges man.

Whats wrong with China? Many high quality products come from china, the whole shit about cheap Chinese crap is straight up racist and misunderstood. There's always gonna be cheap Chinese crap because there are people who buy them. Look at all the shit you have around your house, I guarantee you that more than 50% is made in china. And why did you buy it? Because it was cheap and good. We all wouldn't be able to have everything that we do have if is wasn't for global competition pushing for lower and lower prices while increasing productivity. Am I saying its the best, Fuck No, but as a consumer we already bought the shit without thinking about it.

Now here's my beef with you; you get all high and mighty with your fucking ugly ass board saying "ohh it's for sale" talking shit. But clearly you are in the wrong league with @onloop, hes way past you bro. the mentality that you have now, won't get you much. If you really wanna bitch around and have people respect you, that will never happen. Nobody  with any intelligence respects a person when they're bitching, look at Donald Trump...

My gut feel is Enertion has stepped up a level and this will be an interesting release. 

This tech space is rapidly evolving.

Man, your taking everything I say out of context. There is nothing wrong with china if you go to the right people, which is probably well over 50% of manufacturers there. I mentioned in one of my posts about how long it takes to get stuff from china as one of the reasons I don't have a 2nd gen prototype working right now. Everyone gets some amounts of parts from china. It was a response to him saying I don't make anything myself. You can't call someone out for having some parts made in china and making some parts in house while you make the entire thing in china. That was my whole point there.

Jason is a business man, plan and simple. I don't blame him for moving to 100% assembly in china, the guy is trying to move up the ladder and compete with companies like evolve. I said time and time again, we're in different leagues. He has sold a complete and parts before, I haven't sold anything other than my vesc telemetry system. He's also looking at a cheaper market, while I'm more interested in the higher end of the market.

I also said multiple times that his raptor 2 will be far better than the main stream competition, like evolve and boosted.

I'm also not bitching, if you think that, then you need to go back to the beginning of this thread, and then the fork onloop made of this thread were I tried to give him advice about flaws I saw (one of which was the kv that he's now changing). Seeing our conversation/argument at this point is seeing the whole thing out of context.

If someone is going to fire claims and take shots at me, I'm going to stand my ground and defend myself. I get that it's not always the smartest business move, but Jason understands the feeling because he's the same way.

At the end of the day, if someone makes claims that appear over the top, I will call them out for it. It's people who sit down and say nothing that helped get that idiot Trump elected. You have to have debates at times so that both people in the end come out seeing a different point of view, whether you agree with it or not.

My boards will likely retail in the $2500 - $3000 range. Like I said, they won't be consumer boards. They aren't meant for the average person. It's not that I can't create a powerful board for under $1000. I want to go the extra yard and create a board with unique features and more power than most know what to do with, and use the highest quality parts.

My arguments with him have nothing to do with my business interests anyways. As you can see, we have different target customer bases. I have been a DIY builder for almost 2 years now, and me calling bs when I see it is because I'm a builder seeing extra ordinary claims being made, not because I want to tear down my competition. Onloop and I go back a long ways. There was a time were he told me hubs were too weak and belt drives were still the future. Obviously, he saw the light and changed. But taking the things said he in the last 20 posts and saying I'm just whining like a little bitch about his board is taking everything out of context. Your not looking at where this all came from.

Trust me, a lot of people on this forum agree with me here about believing the claims being made here are bs, they just don't want to do it publicly. And responses like yours are why. Someone will always come along and take what you say out of context or spin it in the wrong direction.

I'm done here, because there is no winning when it comes to enertion fan boys. That's why torqueboards, chaka, Lever, and all the other e-board companies gave up arguing.

Jason mind making another thread specifically for just Raptor 2 updates with user comments disabled? I've already invested in a product I believe in and could care less about peoples opinions. It is getting rather annoying scrolling through all the arguments going on in this thread. I'm sure there are others that feel the same.

The only thing about the Raptor I'd like to be improved are the rear wheels, such a thin layer of rubber makes me uneasy with my Raptor 2 preorder as my neighborhood has too many bad roads and I'm already used to 100mm MBS wheels or 97MM Abec 11 Flywheels.

Are there any chances you could offer wheels with more ruber on it in order to get at least 97mm and a more comfy ride?

What are you hoping to improve on with larger wheels? is it mainly for going over rocks & not getting tripped up etc? Or are you more talking about vibrations and rider comfort?

Because 90mm is already massive and can clear most rocks & debris, any bigger & you need a different deck... you also might need to rewind the motors to get optimal performance with the larger diameter... AMybe you just need some air inflated all terrain wheels.

If its just about comfort, vibrations etc, can try adding some extra thickness sole of shoes to help dampen vibrations, I know some of my better skate shoes are much more comfortable than runners etc...

More Urethan => Softer Ride
It's a difference riding 80mm solid steel +10mm Urethan compared to riding 25mm Urethan on a plactic core.
And the type of Urethan do also matter, ABEC11 75a is much better than Raptor 1 PowerWheels Urethan for example.

Carvon-Style would be an improvement, it adds more weight but I thinkt it's worth it.
You could also use suspension trucks, they are not super great but it helps.

Inflated all-terrains don't look like a longboard anymore, I don't like that very much.

more urathane does not equal a softer ride. its more dependent on the hardness and rebound of the urathane than anything else... you can have a low aspect ratio wheel and have it soft and smooth with reasonable speed...and you can have a solid urathane huge wheel and have it hard as a rock so every grain of sand feels like vibration.

what you have to think about with these wheels is scale... it looks thin because its only so much of the total "wheel"... but the wheel is huge, so the amount of urathane there is fine.

Hopefully they have a good formular similiar to abec11. I'm going to test the soft-difference between the Ghosts, Abecs and MBSs in Mai, June or July whenever the Raptor 2 hits the city.
Yes, the wheel is huge, but diameter is only 90mm (same as my Yuneec), so it is the smalest of the huge wheels.
The Ghost is wider, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing in terms of ride comfort, wee'l see.

finally watched the video all the way through. I got some nice info, and thanks for the update... but on one subject you tried, but ended up doing a horrible job explaining why a hub motor can work without the visible gearing of the belt drive.

I know BLDC motors as well, but the field strengths effects on Kv, keeping the flux contained etc... is not something intuitive that can be explained easily to the casual person. This is how I would try if I were you:


(hold up your belt driven motor) this motor can output enough power to move a person, but it spins at high RPM.
(hold up your hub motor) this motor can output the same power to move a person, but it spins at lower RPM.

since the motor turns slower, but its putting out the same power, torque is increased. Have it spin slow enough, and you can have it directly turn the wheel. again, same power, but different speeds.

To put it another way, give the belt motor 40 volts and it will spin at 9800 RPM (or whatever it is for your motor)
give the hub motor that same 40 volts, and it will only spin at 3000RPM (or whatever it is for your motor)
The speed is lower, so the torque increases.
The belt driven motor increases its torque with the belt ratio. It trades its high speed for torque.
The hub motor naturally stays in the proper speed range, because its designed for the application.
Thats why it works without a belt.

then you can go back into your whole "belt driven boards are based off whats available in the hobby industry, instead of being designed for the task" part that you mentioned.
```

```
The only thing missing is that the torque is directly proportional to the current, but so are the I^2R losses and others

So for a hub motor to keep its pace to a belted setup and not overheat it has to be designed to be really efficient, but i think Jason is more than capable of doing it

uhh, also keep in mind, he only has a 5 day lead between when the last parts SHOULD arrive, and when the first boards are supposed to start shipping, so if ANYTHING happens to slow it down, you may not get yours until the very end of the month, or possibly the next.
still better than most kickstarters, but dont have a big skate trip planned before it arrives.

Thanks for the valued order. We are pushing hard to order 500 units in the first batch, this will cover all orders & leave us with stock to sell at the full price so we can finally make some profit.... This will really set us up to take on the big players.

To order this many Raptor 2 we need to spend nearly $400K USD in a 50-day window... :slight_smile: That's over half a million in Australian Dollars. 

At the moment we are in limbo, if we don't sell enough over the next 40-50 days we might fall short of our 500unit target.... of course we can do a smaller first batch to get the orders out faster to the early orders & Kickstarter backers, however that means a higher unit price per part meaning hard to calculate a firm delivery window on the 2nd batch which i am sure will annoy all the people who have placed their orders in 2017....  Very stressful & also exhilarating time for enertion!

Anyway, i still have a very small amount of time to make this decision.... It's very exciting and we will make the decisions based on trying to satisfy as many people as possible whilst also sticking to our extremely tight delivery window.....

**The next two weeks are critical.**

I don't think there's any chance that you wont sell 500 units...  I know money is the great motivator, but its a better board than the majority of the competition at a much better price point.  If you can affor the risk, I'd say go with 500 units in the firs batch, I think you will be happy with the result.

Hell, if I had the money I'd loan it to you at 15% and make a fortune! :slight_smile:

Maybe, but I think that the issue is the money and coming up with it.  $400k US is a shit ton of cash to come up with.  I think if he sells 400 + he will get 500 in the first batch.  That should satisfy the pre-orders plus a few.  

I could be totally wrong, but I don't think quality is going to be an issue.  He will have test boards before he makes the actual first batch order.

Hi,
I'm almost ready to pre order a Raptor 2. What's still bugging me is that I only saw the new raptor riding straight. It seems like its really build for high speeds and going straight. 

Now what I would enjoy would be some nice carving and it seems like a board with some flex that is not focused on top speed would get this point better. Is this justified?

I guess to get a different board feel I could put the raptor drive train on a drop down deck, use different bushings and use wedges to get a smaller truck angle. Right?
I am not experienced with e boards and and not an expert on longboards either, just know what i like to do when I stand on one.

Can you guys help me on my desision?

Cheers

We definitely setup the raptor electronics so it can go fast... however, the trucks actually come with a fairly soft bushing setup that is probably good for 80kg riders & the wheelbase is actually fairly short when compared to a normal longboard. The short wheelbase makes the raptor ride feel very responsive & agile.

So out of the box i think you will feel like you can carve.... If you plan to ride full speed i'd suggest you actually need to tune the bushing for your body weight.

If you decide you dont like the raptor deck you can swap the deck to something different to get your perfect setup.

Oh and you probably wouldnt be able to ship the board in a way that I get around the german VAT, would you? ;)

The board will be shipping from an EU country warehouse for EU customers. Jason mentioned this before on one of his vids for exactly this reason; to avoid the VAT. The first batch is 500 units I believe and there hasn't been that many orders yet so you should be fine. He also mentioned optional trucks that should come some time this year that will have adjustable angle. Sadly the Kickstarter goal was not reached for this to be included in the first batch and will only be available later on as a separate purchase.  I'll leave it to Jason to confirm this though just giving you the heads up.

Jason after watching your Facebook live video I can tell you are still skeptical about an all terrain setup. I do get your point about the board not being designed for off-road use and needing to be strapped onto the board for better control and such; however, most of us who request an all terrain setup actually want one for a different reason. 

By me for example  I also intend on using it on old country roads that may have occasional cracks or debris on them, such as small rocks. This is where all terrain tires would shine and prevent the risk of a wipe out and tire bite. Here in Germany the law is still in the grey area for e-boards. If I were to  use it in a proper urban city area it will attract too much attention and I will most likely end up with fines from the police once they realize the speed I'm traveling at.  Other reason is there is simply less oncoming traffic on these roads and  they serve mainly as bicycle routes. Only down side of these roads is that they are maintained maybe once a year and winter takes its toll on them. Also the bike paths along the main roads here mainly consist of gravel on which I wouldn't even use all terrain tires on, just too much drain on batteries in that case. Going up pavements will also be made easier by such a setup, sure I could ollie up one but why risk injury to a pedestrian or myself.

South of Germany. Drei L√§nder Eck won't go into detail hehe. Btw VAT gets charged by customs on delivery by the postman, but since it's being shipped from within a EU warehouse we're safe. And sure with hub motors  the board looks like a regular skateboard, but full speed you will still stick out and although the motors are quiet they can still be heard pretty well. Town areas are fine since there basically aren't any coppers around. Cities on the other hand stick to low speeds or  you'll stick out like thorn since it is a fast board it will be obvious for them you are not moving it with your own two feet. Also German cops are not as bad  most are still uninformed about the law and as long as you are using it responsibly and and stick at 6km/h on sidewalks you shouldn't have a problem. But there is always the off chance one of them is having a bad day and is informed. Switzerland on the other hand be warned they will hit you with fines every chance they can get.

Update from the stream (watched the first half):

1. Showing off the latest iteration for the precision trucks and some waterproofing materials
2. Timeline update: He's doing smaller batches. So not all boards will ship in May:
a. Ramp up batch: First 30 boards / people who bought their raptor in price tier 1 and 2 (Expected mid/end May)
b. Batch 1: All boards up to the end of the Kickstarter campaign (Will ship in June)
c. Batch 2: All boards ordered after the Kickstarter campaign (Shipping end of June)
3. He shows of some of the deck designs, The original, the flatter version, and then one with microdrops.
4. Some more ordering and production updates.

@onloop You said you might ship the first ramp up batch to customers directly. That might give some customs issues for us Europeans. What's the plan there?
(As one of the first people having ordered at the 899$ price, it'd really suck to have to pay the import duties and someone who ordered at the 1099$ price wouldn't, so they'd probably get it cheaper)

@onloop You said you might ship the first ramp up batch to customers directly. That might give some customs issues for us Europeans. What's the plan there?(As one of the first people having ordered at the 899$ price, it'd really suck to have to pay the import duties and someone who ordered at the 1099$ price wouldn't, so they'd probably get it cheaper)
[/quote]

If you prefer to wait a bit longer we can send using slower methods & you will avoid the tax, if we send direct it's faster but may cost more in tax.

## WHO WANTS AN 20% BATTERY CAPACITY UPGRADE WITH YOUR RAPTOR 2
At enertion, we love nothing better than using the latest & greatest technology! We now have an exciting opportunity to do a significant battery upgrade before we start production.

**Doing this upgrade doesn't increase the size of the battery physically. It does increase the capacity & performance. Less SAG & More RANGE - NOTE: It does increase the price :dollar:**

Check out the battery comparison tests [>here<](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/42075)

## Only If you are a Raptor 2 pre-order customer (website or Kickstarter) please vote below

(if you are **not** a raptor 2 customer you can simply reply with your comments below)

* Standard 360Wh Battery (Samsung 25r)
* 432Wh Battery (Samsung 30Q)

## :dollar: NEXT QUESTION :dollar: 



## Would you pay somewhere between $55 - $70USD to get this upgrade included?
NOTE: We won't offer this later! It's a one time deal & if the majority of customers don't want to upgrade we can't afford to do it.

I have 7 boards ordered and would love to upgrade the cells if its not too late. Would gladly pay the extra $55-$70 per board. This is already the best board currently in production, using the best parts, why not use the best battery? I'm game

Plus using the latest battery cells is another major buying point for the raptor2. I would assume if you switch the the 30Q packs, that should draw up a lot of interest in the esk8 community and sell more pre-orders. Would also put the Evolve gt battery to shame (the current king of main market boards), since a lot of people complain about its voltage sag issues (pack adjusts to eco mode at 40%)

I'm in for the battery but I fear the logistics of getting an accurate count of people who want it and will pay for it isn't gonna happen. Without contacting each preorder personally by phone or email, I'm not sure how you are gonna decide to pull the trigger on it. Also getting everyone to respond back and then to pay on the short time frame you have left before production is going to be difficult. I hope you can figure out a way to get the responses/payments and make it happen.

Hopefully it would only be $55 and not $70... I would still pay for the bigger battery, but definitely would rather pay the lesser amount. The price difference between 25r batteries and 30q batteries can't be too much of a difference.

## \#1036 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2017-03-23T02:36:00.249Z Reads: 244

the price depends on how our quotes from suppliers are, the battery market fluctuates, as does currency. So we first get the feedback from customers if the numbers are good, then we get the final quotes for buying the cells, then we can finally determine the price & ask people to pay. Then we order the cells. All happen over next week or two.

I don't get how this will work out.

So what if 90% thinks the upgrade is awesome and don't mind paying the extra 55-70.

You can't MAKE the last 10% pay anything.. And they should still receive their boards with the original specs.

Does this mean 2 versions of the enertion board will make it to the market if enough people are interested in the upgraded battery?

With the Samsung Q30 the raptor 2 is for me the best board on the market, better then evolve carbon gt. I hope all people understand that 55$ is nothing for 20% more range. All people now saved a lot with the nice level Prices from enertion.

You do realize that you just told me that:
1. I will be waiting longer, and even though theres only 1hour diff in between when I ordered, and the last tier ended, I will wait atleast 1 extra month.
2. You want me to pay even more before I get my board.

If it comes down to me paying $70 more, I'm just going to say screw it and want my money back. While its entering winter for you, its missing prime riding time for me... I could take my money back and spend it on other things this summer.

I'm looking forward to this sleek fast board.

I also ordered 4 months ago. I expect the cutoff to happen so that if you were promised by X date.. it happens then. When that can no longer be met, that should be changed on the sale site.

its not complicated, its exactly the same as any other online sale. Whats complicating it is constant updates and redesign. I dont care if it has a larger battery, its not really a better battery when you look at other factors, but whatever. timing is becoming is more important than more features.

another note. realistically speaking one or two people will not want to spend the extra 50 - 70 USD.
Assuming they spent $1200 dollars, thats 17-24 upgrades per canceled order.

in otherwords, if you're going to do it, its free.. otherwise you cant afford to do it.
screwing with it further messes up everyone down the line. all those group buys. all the people who paid already. everyone who doesnt have only this as their hobby, and doesnt want the hassle.

edit: This is part of building a business case for large decisions like this. If you cant justify eating the cost at this point for the board, you cant build a case for having it and should be looking at other options (like 2 batteries, for example)

It will be a slow release whether or not a better battery is selected. I don't see the big deal with everyone complaining about waiting a little longer. I also ordered mine in December. Yes, it sucks I have to wait longer, but I would much rather wait to get a fully functional board with no problems, then to rush it out and not be able to use it. This is the problem with society these days. I am totally for having the better battery by the way. I saved a crap load of money by pre-ordering I don't care about a measly $50-70

I think, from all the feedback that has been collected so far, most raptor2 owners want to go with the upgraded battery. $50-$70 really isn't that much when talking about the cost of new eboards or their batteries. And a 20% increase in battery size is a sizable gain. The only issue is the few people who are but hurt about shipping delays or price increases...

1st: Almost all (if not all) electric skateboards have shipping delays!!! Jason has been super transparent with us about the updates within Enertion. A month delay (which he said might be shorter) doesn't  seem that long in the main scheme of things. Additionally he explained why he was doing it (reduce risk of first-run mass-production errors) and gave over a month and a half heads up (most eskate company release delays only after they missed their target ship date).

2nd: This is a nominal price increase. Considering most premium 10s4p batteries packs cost around $400, a 20% increase of $400 would be $80 (in the same ballpark of what Jason is saying $55-$70 for the upgraded battery). This is a very reasonable price to be asking investors to donate to receive a better product (for christ sakes the guy works out of his garage, he not a millionaire.. at least not yet)

Jason seem like he really cares about his product and wants to give his customers the best boards he can using the highest quality products. These new 30Q cell are the best available for the raptor2 compared to the 25r, which are 5 year old and 20% less power. Im all on board with spending a little more to help future proof my battery

The first recipients are not beta testers. We already have testers who have been receiving samples and are doing real world tests since January. Also, if time permits there will be another round of beta testers before the first shipment.

The ramp up batch is designed only to test & tune the production process. It is not a method to determine the functionality of the product and our customers are not required to do test rides on our behalf. (However we will always listen to feedback)

The primary objective of ramping up production is to de-risk bulk production and eliminate stupid mistakes.

Some Examples:
Over torqing screws. 
Not applying enough thread lock glue. 
Missing parts.
Routing wires incorrectly.
Connecting motors incorrect.
Using test jigs incorrectly.
Skipping assembly steps.
Order of operation adjustments.


The idea is to find little problems and resolve them before they become big delays.

Onloop,I am getting the sense from reading above that it might be difficult to convince all 300 pre orders to pay the extra money to get the battery upgrade. 

I imagine you want this upgrade to happen, as much as we do as it will make selling future inventory easier by having a more current consumer product offering, without having to create a larger battery Raptor 2.1 version in the near future.  It sounds like not having multiple variants of Raptor 2's is one of your prime objectives for production efficiency reasons.  

So might it make sense to charge everyone a bit less (something like $40) and use your your profit margin to partially subsidize the cost of the upgrade in order to ensure unanimity among the current pre orders?  You could then adjust the price of the product for all future sales to recap any lost margin and ensure that you have a product that is cutting edge and at the top of the industry for the longest period of time without needing to upgrade.

Just a thought... Either way I am on board for the upgrade.

The 30Q test graphs, that were linked to in the original battery upgrade post, are dated 9/27/2015. So, going by that, I do not believe that these cells were just recently introduced. It is ashamed that the 30Q was not included in the original specs. I am all for the upgrade and the resultant price increase.

However, I had to pay a $29.75 USD foreign currency conversion fee when I ordered my Raptor 2. I'm in the USA. This was a surprise to me when I logged into my credit card account. I DO NOT want to pay another conversion fee. I don't know if it is a percentage of the original amount paid. I have to do some research to find out about this fee. My bank's website had no info on it. I am going to have to spend time on the phone to find out. I would have gladly spent the additional $55 to $70 when I originally ordered.

Is there an alternative payment method to avoid the conversion fee?

I am really looking forward to actually riding my Raptor 2.

In fairness to Jason it may not have been a viable option when he started this project and I think we would all agree his intentions on providing the upgrade option are good.... didn't notice the foreign conversion fee, but I think I remember reading somewhere in the fine print that something like that might apply

I am not criticizing Jason in the least. I'm all for more range. It is just unfortunate that this upgrade situation seems complicated. A 432Wh pack sounds good to me. I just want to ride.

As far as I can tell, the fee was charged by my bank. It is the first fee that I have been charged in my 33 years with them. I don't like fees. I have never paid interest on any credit card either.

I'm feeling confident. 96% have said they want it and 89% said they are willing to pay for it.

The irony in that statement is that I am not paying more for mine, yet I just opened my new Bell Star RSD helmet and its sitting here next to me. I have more money in motorcycle riding gear than several raptors cost.

still doesnt mean that I wont draw the line and say "this is how much I am willing to spend, and no more". You seem to assume my reasons for not paying more are based on not having the money, rather than other reasons.

It's personal preference at that point dude. Million bucks says its not about the money for most. Its probably about the fact that they paid for something and now the price is changing.

Yeah, I got hit with the foreign fee as well.   The good news is that it is a 3% fee (on most cards).  So you won't have to pay $29.75 again... more like $2-$4 (some cards have a $5 min. though).

If early June, I'm fine with that... if late July, I might rethink this since most of my spring & summer will be gone by then.   In another month, torqueboards might have a non-carbon-only board out...

Thank you for the info. I had not given it any thought since I ranted about that fee. 

I had originally searched my bank's site and did not find what I wanted. I should have just searched the internet in the first place. My VISA card charges 3% of each transaction converted to U.S. dollars. 

So if the upgrade is a maximum of $70, the fee will be $2.10. That I can live with. 

Let's get this done. I want to ride my Raptor 2. I'm glad I already have a board to ride that I like. I also have another one coming in addition to the Raptor 2. I think I have a problem.

I'm not sure if BigCommerce has a group buy plugin or not, but maybe you could post the product as a group buy and people buy the product, but they are not charged until a certain order minimum is reach. If you sold 400 boards, then the min group buy order amount could be 350... Once that minimum is reach payment is processed.

I think that would be the best way to approach everyone paying, because if not enough participate then no one was charged.

the answer to that is no. I was already upset I paid much more than the "current tier" he still had listed on his site. I have already paid my "extra little bit more than I wanted to spend"

while its great hes trying to make the best out of the box board anywhere, he drew the price line and I said ok. Its higher than I wanted, but for a variety of reasons I went for it. If that price were to change, I would just cancel.
I dont think I am blowing the party for anyone anyway. I DONT want the larger capacity battery due to their current output. If you have the batteries in hand and test them, instead of just reading spec sheets, you would see the voltage drop difference between the two. Im all for overbuilding a battery, and using a fraction of its capacity to have them last longer, but this isnt going to have the BMS clipping the upper and lower voltages for long battery life, nor are these motors going to be kind loads to the battery. I can accept that it will need to be replaced in a couple years... then I would just replace the cells with some cheap rc lipo pouches. Thats how I see the board. So no. I am not blowing the party for the rest. Im just at my limit and will not go further.

I dont want to rain on it, but that doesnt give me anything.
I already have a drawer full of HC-05 and HC-06 bluetooth modules I use for all kinds of projects. I just need to stick a connector on one, and they just plug into the VESC. Normally they're 5 to 10 dollars, online, but I bought them overseas and paid something like 50 cents for each of them in bulk.
The problem here isnt getting people to buy more, the problem is feature creep.

I ordered mine too, hopefully people just just pay up, anyone that doesn't see the value, come on you get 20% more battery and BT!!! Just 55 euro extra, it's a nobrainer! People buy the raptor2 because they want the best of the best right!! Not because it's just good enough...

I would like the upgrade for my raptor2. PayPal it will be very useful. Just i cannot remember how many times i did not buy in your web because of the credit card thing. I don't mind to pay the PayPal fee. I hope you can do something.

## DESIGN UPDATE

I have been talking about / thinking about this new deck shape way too much over the last week, I also showed it on my live facebook feeds.... to be honest, can't get it out of my head. For simplicity sakes it would have been easier to stick with a very straight deck, but I'm glad i didnt.

I really like this deck shape a lot! It has a very subtle rocker & micro drops, It feels very reassuring underfoot and feels like I have a better connection with the board. I can see this being a big advantage at higher speeds when braking & accelerating lots. You will feel more "locked-in",  especially if there's some moisture around, as you will be able to better secure your foot above the front trucks to form a solid base and prevent the foot from slipping forward.

If you do tend to ride in a tuck position the rear micro drop at this wheelbase length is also well positioned for locking down the rear foot. I normally wouldn't use this position for my rear foot (I'm originally a street/trick deck skater so always have my rear foot on the kick) but now it's there I might bring my back foot forward more often. I think when cruising at slower speeds I'll be more inclined to relax & bring my foot forward into this small pocket as it feels very comfortable and I get the sense that even though with a more narrow stance I will still feel well grounded & in control.

Due to the rocker of this deck mold I have added two extra maple layers & cut a deeper battery case section, the extra thickness has allowed me to modify the aluminum handles. I have been able to create a new design that is more seamless with the top of the deck. Personally, I don't move around too much top side but several people have said the original handle design may have been an issue for foot placement. I have taken that feedback on board & with this new design the entire top side is open & free for any foot position.....

 **CHANGES**

* new deck mold / concave features (length, width wheelbase all the same as before)
* new handle design


**NOTES**

* The extra maple layers do add some weight, but we are also cutting deeper into the layers.
* I have also increased the wheel cutouts to remove more material & reduce weight further.
* Overall the weight is still similar to a normal 9ply longboard deck.

lol deck design is so personal to each ones tastes so never going to solve optimally for all people.  I personally like micro-drops on my current builds ALOT, so great.  I also prefer a really slim unobtrusive handle design (maybe removeable, but with torx or secure mount for those wanting to use for locking down).  so great.

I paid... Lets do this.   @onloop You should be advertising the bluetooth hardware too.    Thats sweet.

Also, Your email went to my "promotions" folder on gmail (I didn't see it).   If you're sending to just buyers, make it look like more of a transactional email (subject like: "Your enertion boards order - Action required") you will get much better opens.  Idea: Give them 2 actions to take: 1. order, 2. reply to the email saying you are not going to order and why.

Also, make the content look less an upsell and more like a personal email from yourself.  Talk about how this is all or nothing and you need their help... etc.

P.S.  I may do marketing, mostly digital, for a living.   Take my advise for what you think its worth.

@Cam, "need" might be a little strong.   Check out android vs IOS market share: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os

From a business standpoint android market is bigger.  From his target market standpoint (his "old" market was DIY customer), I'm guessing android is much larger than IOS.

I'm not saying this to be argumentative, just saying that it may not be high on his priorities and it would makes sense for it not to be... especially based on everything else that needs to get done.

@that0n3guy - fair enough on the IOS android split world wide, but in North America the split split is a very different story (see link below).  Jason @onloop , would have a better sense of his regional market opportunity, but I am willing to guess North America is a disproportionately large portion of his consumer base?

I would also imagine this would likely be low involvement exercise for Jason that could run in parallel to the other product development initiatives that would be the theoretical bottleneck in meeting production completion timelines.  

Not sure what the costs would be, but could be an easy win that might be worth exploring to booster future sales.

The new design is heaps better Jason! 

Here's an idea for you. Even though the handle design is far better integrated, there may be still  some who are put off by the look of the handles (not me). I assume the handles are screw in, so why don't you try offering as an accessory a solid screw in replacement for the handles to those people?  In other words sell the boards as is, but also sell little plastic bits seperately that you can screw in to replace those handles and kind of integrate with the lines of the each side of the board to give a more 'traditional' look.  Just an idea mate. :slight_smile:

So what's the update on the booster pack? I was under the impression only if at least 80% of raptor 2 customers purchase this pack it would go through and otherwise be refunded. I went mountain biking in France for the weekend without internet so ended up missing out. Was hoping to purchase it today only to see the price almost double. I don't mind paying the increase tbh, as long as it will lower that % required for it to be implemented, although in this case it is kind of unfair some paid more than others in the end.

Cceramic bearings are much harder to install with an interference fitting especially on shafts and housing that will be changing diameter with changing temp.  
Ive seen them explode with shock loads on a hub motor and just a tight slide (radial) fit with .1mm axial play

I can say without a shadow of doubt, they are wrong. Properly laminated, it will stay together regardless of the order of the layers.
however I can say that having the CF on the outer layers makes it much stiffer than having it closer together...  
On this board, the entire reason for the CF is looks anyway. The board itself is wood. Theres no reason to have inner CF layers unless you want to make the board thinner, and his design doesnt look that way.

Personally, I want him to stop dicking with the design. His largest problem is what we call Feature Creep. You can always make something a little better, so he keeps doing it and doing it.. and then screwing himself over.  Every change or public decision will have people for and against it. Some people just want their boards, others want "the best" but may disagree with what "the best" is.  Each thing he announces, he pretty much has to do or it will piss a good bit of people off. Everything he changes will make it take longer.

for example, he only wants to stock ONE battery. He knows this. We know this. It makes sense for keeping stock. But now that hes opened his mouth, hes in a corner. If he doesnt do the battery upgrade, he will still end up doing it later.. and have 2 batteries.   or if he does it now he has only one and can buy in bigger bulk, etc... but some people will get the battery free while others paid. Again pissing people off because its unfair.
And this whole time, hes pushing the ship date back because hes still changing stuff. Back over a month ago when he did the velodrome video, thats when he should have already ordered the motors... back when he redesigned the case, while I do like the new case design, that should already be designed ordered, and on the way to wherever final assembly will be. Now hes redoing the board.

Lets see, new motor, new case, new board... its an entirely new design cooked up in the last 3 months... there is no way hes going to get a board made and shipped to me until autumn. (northern hemisphere)

I know. Going to order once I get home from work. Watched his latest facebook video already.  Hopefully the amount of people who are willing to buy  the pack without having been aware of it is large. Would be a shame if we end up not getting the upgrade implemented.

Hi Jason, i didn't get to ask you on your last live update about the motherboard!
will we be able to get to the usb ports on the vesc-x ok it looks tight maybe include an angled micro usb connector which is left connected to each vesc-x so you can access the port easily?
nice work so far mate can't wait to get mine.

Hopefully 90% Is based off the amount of boards sold at the time the boost pack was released, because we will be constantly  chasing 90% every single time someone buys a board.@onloop is the boostpack included in the price of the board if someone buys it now?

I think I could offer a counter thought coming from car culture....Cost, reliability, performance...pick two.  His boards come in much lower on cost compared to competitors, and reliability isn't perfect, but he has a dedicated team to get to the bottom of now and they are helping address issues that do come up but you have to consider this is such a new industry and IMO having personally dealt with enertion they've been great and any issues I've had have been dealt with in a timely fashion.  Sure, it's not perfect but some say evolve/boosted boards are the set bar as far as brands go in the industry and I've heard just as many stories if not many many more.  

If you guys think Jason is doing it wrong, step up and build a board yourself.  That is a big learning curve, I'm sure your board might do a few mph more and do it a little faster....oh it cost 500 more to do it...oh and you had to learn and build it yourself...Ok now you've built your board...go build a company.  

Jason has his ear to the ground on what the people want, hence, this forum.  IMO he's killing it.  The world of electric motors change day to day and most companies when they get to this level start taking on big investors and letting them call the shots.  His investors have always been the people that buy his product.  He listens and answers to you guys.  Over 90 % of people want the bigger battery pack and are willing to wait.  To me, that just is a voice of a democracy of the riders it actually matters to.

I appreciate his openness and his willingness to learn from mistakes.  When's the last time you saw a company founder come on and tell you how to build a similar product for cheaper and taught you how to do it on youtube?  When have you seen them come on and 'publicly' say hey some stuff came up and it might cause delays...what's the groups thoughts? I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I've yet to see it.

I'm not pro enertion for any reason but I just see a guy like me that just wants to do the best job he can do.  No one is perfect but if I was to ever run a company this is how I would want to run it.  It won't be a big pay day for him and he'll catch a lot of crap for it but I think he's trying to build boards the best he can for the people that will use them while trying to create something that will keep him happily mentally not punching a 9 to 5 desk job and still be able to know he's following a passion of his.

So complete noob to the board here. I plunked my money down last week to hold my place in line and added the boost pack in hopes that it gets added. The website was a little confusing regarding the boost pack. I couldn't tell whether it was included in the new price or not.. There should be some clearer language about it. If I hadn't been reading the forum, I wouldn't have known to add it.

I have been using more off the shelf boards to this point. My wife and I have 2 boards a boosted dual and a dual+ from the first generation. Love riding the boards but there were a few improvements that I was looking for that led me to the R2.

-I wanted more speed and the ability to access the software that governs the performance of the motors. I was more than frustrated to find out that boosted puts a limiter on their engines and won't release the source code to allow you to adjust it.
-I needed more distance in a single charge. I work a little over 5 miles from home and was barely able to get the boosted there on eco mode. I'm more of a pedal to the metal kind of guy and want to be able to push full speed on the way to work.
-I wanted more of a downhill board built for speed. Ideally, I wanted to use a deck of my choosing like my Sector 9 mini Daisy. The boosted board is more of an all around deck and all of the wiiring runs through the deck itself...making it impossible to switch out. I do like the new deck design BTW. The shape and micro drops remind me of the downhill decks I was thinking about. Looking forward to riding it.

That's why I jumped at the R2. I don't have quite the technical skill of others here and didn't want the steep learning curve to build a custom board...so this is the next best thing.

The one issue that it didn't resolve (but i'm hopeful some of the DIY gurus can assist with here) is being able to use a puck with the remote. When I take a corner at speed, being able to put a glove hand down for support lets me take faster and sharper turns. It's just next to impossible to do this with a remote in your hand. I gave some serious thought to waiting for the OneWheel+ because it did not have the remote associated and some improved distance. 

But it was my need for speed that won out and I opted for the R2. What I will try to do is modify the remote so that I can secure a puck to the bottom of it. My thought I could have the puck on the bottom of my fist with the controller, I could still use it on right turns. It will take some getting used to, but I think its doable. Anyone else have luck with using a downhill puck on their remote hand?

Interesting site, but not seeing any shots of the remote and a puck. They do a bunch of left turns in the videos, but no rights that I saw. The best pic is the dude on the main page squatting down and grabbing the board with his left hand (can see the puck on that glove) and the remote behind his back (no puck to see there)

I did really like the shapes on the initial component box much better. Had something really unique to it.. Not with these half moons it looks much more generic :frowning:

Btw, the sides look very square (almost 90 degree corners), wouldn't it be better to have sloped edges so it doesn't look as massive from the side?

a more aerodynamic shape was an option, but in reality it doesn't really do anything except making the total unit longer which limits deck choice later.

**lots of people haven't ordered, only 188 of 320ish, so about 60%**

looks like ill have to arrange to do a sperate batch with the smaller battery & no Bluetooth.

Our battery factory can't make these different packs at the same time, so priority will go to manufacturing the upgraded 30Q battery first... I suppose boost pack means you get Raptor 2 a bit quicker as well as bigger battery.



_If anyone reading hasn't done the upgrade yet, it's still on sale at the crazy low price of $59_

How can you separate those who paid and those who didnt?
You first told everyone that you were going to a big batch, if ordering now (back then, when I ordered). That didnt happen ofcourse. Then you told you were doing smaller batches and now 30 first or something. Now you say that "If you dont pay you wont get it, even if you ordered before everyone else, after your order"...

sounds like he will do ramp up with Q30 and then do first batch Q30 and then switch over to the cheaper motor for batch 2.  Don't worry you'll get your board, just might take an extra couple of weeks.  these shifts in timing are all  part of buying pre production and why you got such a good price

I already paid more than I wanted to for the damn thing, since his site charged more than the price listed on there... but I went with it anyway, since I had mistakenly assumed he had learned from his past raptor batches... and would ship within a reasonable time.

At this point, hes still designing the damn thing, has nothing ordered, and Im already bumped back to the 2nd or 3rd parts order.

I paid 1150 euros, + that discount code he gave, which is about 30 euros if I pay for the boostpack. 
When I paid there was a discount code raptor999 that I totally missed. I assume there was a great amount of people buying for that price. Ofcourse it wont be a problem for them or the kickstarters since they got the board alot cheaper then me. 
IF I would buy a second board today I would actually just pay 70 euros more, lol and get the second board faster then my first according to @onloop recent post.

I totally understand what MrDude is rambling about. I paid roughly $1300 USD for the raptor 2. And that was only a few minutes after the official start of the website campaign. Then here's the kickstarter that opened up and people are able to buy a board for a much lower price than what I paid for. I understand that he has to do some of this in order to sell the board, but it still kinda hurts when I see other paying much less for the board.

The reason he introduced the booster pack is because there was a lot of interest in a better battery on his live streams. He argued the point at first saying it would be too hard to do that logistically. After there was more and more interest in a booster pack, he wanted to make his customers happy my giving them the opportunity to upgrade. I bought the booster pack. I'm not saying it was a good or bad idea to introduce the booster pack. I'm just explaining his side a little bit.

FO. I paid (more than I should have for 1) for 2 boards. I ordered 2 that I was told I would get in order of when they were purchased. I didn't ask for anything extra. I shouldn't be forced to the back of the line because you added a little extra cash to his pocket. Whatever you have to say about wanting the pack or not...this is a "Shitty way to do business." I don't really give a hoot if you want something. I have already paid for a product. Deliver it. It is that simple. I'm as stoked as the next person to get my ride. 

He said in his FB live feed we can cancel if we want. He wants $260 to cancel the order. 20%! I would have canceled both my orders by now not because I think the board won't be what he said. Because this is a "Shitty way to do business." It's hard to trust someone who makes it feel like he screws over the ones paying him. Whats next? $60 for the new wheels that are coming out? Lights for $40? BS!! You just going to hope that doesn't happen? Ya'll are the ones setting us up for that.

I skipped a bunch of builders over because I liked that Jason was putting himself out there. This is not cool.

I just looked back at the original posts and didn't see anything about getting them in the order purchased. The only thing mentioned was getting a reduced "earlybird" price...which you got. If you want out and got it for a lower price than its selling for now, why not just sell your spot to someone else? Then you'd get your full amount back and someone else would get that spot in line. No harm...no foul.

I don't think it's about forcing people to the back of the line that didn't buy the upgrade. It's still about getting quality boards out to people asap, but not everyone wants the upgrade so it's a bit more complicated. Seems like having the 30Q battery packs made for the majority would be better for shipping / Manufacturing which would get more boards out faster compared to a ramp up, then a smaller batch then the upgraded batch. I don't think he is trying to screw anybody over...

I don't think Jason is trying "add a little extra cash to his pocket" ...he is doing the the upgrade to put out the best board possible with the available technology.  A lot changes in 6 months from when this all started.  I do agree that because things have changed you should not have to pay 20% deposit if you choose to cancel your order.  Follow up with them, I would be surprised if they didn't make an exception given the circumstances.  Having said that he is trying to accommodate everyone by making 2 versions, so don't punish yourself by canceling when you can still get the board you ordered at discounted price you paid

The bearings in the R-SPEC GHOST hub motors are huge. They will outlast normal skateboard bearings and happily take any beating you can throw at it.

to the complainers.... Jason is tying to get you a better board/battery for about an extra 3% ($59) of the cost of the board.  You held out paying for the upgrade in hopes that you got a free tow along to a better board and now that Jason has indicated that you will only get the original battery you are complaining.  You are going to get exactly what you paid for and after months of waiting it might take an extra couple of week. (who knows these all could be delayed an extra month) I think your real beef is that you aren't getting a free upgrade.  If you want the better board, pay the extra 3% otherwise you will get what you paid for in a reasonable time frame.
PS- if an extra $59 is seems like too big a stretch, I questions whether or not you should of spend a thousand dollars on a skateboard in the first place??

And for some people I think I have to clarify, level 4 and 5 are the same price depending on what code you use. If level 5 have it included its almost the same, difference is 50 euros. 

When I bought my board I used the code 100raptor2, there was also a code that you could get the board for 999 raptor999 (oh well I missed that one)
Today you can buy your board for 1180 euros with the code pushingsucks 10% off the price off 1316 euros
I bought mine for 1135 which means the difference is 45 euros. Kickstarters im not even going to talk about.

I hear where you're coming from.  He's in a tough spot.  60% of people want the upgraded battery (including me).  Since he didn't get the 90% he's got to do two batches.  That pisses off the people that didn't buy the upgrade.  But now, if he cancels and refunds for the upgrade he'll piss off the 60% that did purchase the pack.

I saw this situation coming a mile away, but it is what it is I guess.  There's no way now to make everyone 100% happy.

I spoke with my battery factory, no orders will be delayed. Original orders that didn't upgrade will be processed normally. Just more headaches for me :slight_smile: 

Also, I think you are being harsh, I have not lined my pockets with cash. In fact, if you do some quick research my offer is far better than competitors who also offer battery upgrade.

Doubtful he'll give you a range, because of too many variables that effect range. The battery has 20% more charge. 432wh vs 360wh I believe it was.

Being harsh? You sold us a product that we paid in advance for and are trying to change it on us in an Fd up way. I feel like you are pulling a "Trump" on us and trying to scare people so they jump in and pay more money for this pack. Only the dumb asses want a "Trump". 

"I shouldn't be forced to the back of the line because you added a little extra cash to his pocket" is what I said. It doesn't say you have lined your pockets with cash. It says that those whom pay more get better treatment because thats what you said. Besides, you are in this to make money aren't you?

So I am curious. What are we suppose to believe is the truth? 
"everyone is in or nobody is in" You said this March 22nd. Is that true? Doesn't seem like it.

You just said this 3 days ago? True or not true?
"Our battery factory can't make these different packs at the same time, so priority will go to manufacturing the upgraded 30Q battery first... I suppose boost pack means you get Raptor 2 a bit quicker as well as bigger battery." HHHHMMMMM!!!

In your facebook video on the 22nd you said "this is not going to delay...stuff". Yet if someone who has supported this build for weeks or months now doesn't give you more money for something you want, they get pushed to the back of the line. True or not?

You had 82 votes(on what I see on this pole) for the "upgrade question" and only 89% of that  said they would even pay for it. I am guessing this is NO where close to the number of boards sold at the time. On March 10th you said you sold heaps!! 3 days ago you said "320ish". In the kickstarter you had 101 boards sold (if my math is right). There are only 164 users on this feed. This is not everyone. Yet you still went ahead and made the decision to add a larger more expensive battery without having everyone in. Knowing damn well that there was no way you could get everyone in. Sending a mass email to 'purchase now or it costs more later' does not tell your base the truth. Sounds to me like you are saying -'If you don't buy we will hold your money longer and treat you like a bag of dicks. We care more about the people that want what I want and give me more money than we agreed on.' is that what your going for? We agreed on a price for a product. You changed your mind along with SOME of the people that purchased and now everyone is supposed to pay the price. 

How are we suppose to know that this is the last "upgrade"? Who is to say that we won't be getting a charge for "upgraded lights" because Joe Shmo told you it would be rad?

You also said 'and I said, if you ordered on Kickstarter that gets you in the first batch.' Not true?

"The people get in first are definitely top of the list. They are top priority" March 10th. Not true?

This has little to do with money (although some). I bought 2 boards 1 day apart. 1 for $200 US more than the other. I made a mistake putting the first code in. I asked for that to be changed and you denied me. Thats all good. I decided to roll with it then and let this thing go down the way it was planned. I understand that you need commitment from people to do the build you planned.  We need commitment too. I have two Raptor2 boards ordered, an Acton and a OneWheel+. If Acton or OneWheel pulled this stuff with you, I expect you would be a bit pissed. 'Here's $2300 US for you to play around with and do what you want' is not how this thing was marketed nor is it what I want to be a part of. The price you are now charging for this "upgrade" obviously sounds like a "good deal" but we already had a "good deal". That was what we agreed on to begin with. 

You said this "Yes. There is a 20% fee. It's written on the raptor 2 product page. See FAQ." I looked at the FAQs as you mentioned (many times) and it says "administration fee would be deducted from your refund". An "administration fee" of 20%! WOW. There should be NO "administration fee" now that you have changed the deal. This was not a DIY build. Why are you asking your minions what they want? Do we get to pick the colors too? I would like 4 different color wheels please. Lets vote!

You said this Nov 16th
"Not really hard, Most powerful could mean a few things.

    Biggest battery in wh
    Highest voltage battery
    Highest battery current
    Highest current throughput per motor
    Highest current throughput overall

We offer the best of the all above. Except maybe voltage, need more market data to confirm. Most likely on par with others."
Why the new battery then?

Obviously I am pissed here. It seems to me that you are telling people these mixed comments to get a quick reaction from them. Getting them to buy something that you have changed and committed to in the middle of building a project that has already been paid for. You have your supports fighting with each other over a battery. These guys telling people they are wrong for not forking up the cash is BS. You should be pissed at them for talking shit about how people want to spend their cash. We shouldn't be in this situation. I can only imagine how stressful a situation it is trying to get this built. The only reason I can guess you would offer the larger battery is you are not getting what you want out of the first. It just doesn't make sense. 

As a business man why do this?

I looked at a lot of esk8 companies including Metroboards and DIYelectric(Tourque) and went with you for a couple reasons. I liked that you were putting yourself out there in the vids. That you were committed to putting out the best product (the we pre-paid for).

That you seemed to care about your supporters. I am at a loss on the last one. It seems to me that you care about some of them. The ones that want what you want or have at least done what you want them to do. I would like some honest answers and the truth about what build is happening, when it will be delivered and what is really happening with the battery?

Wow dude, not even sure where @onloop would even start trying to anwner your questions.  It is clear that English is not your fist language, so I will spare picking your rant apart.  

I think the two main points you missed were the following:
1.  The upgrade was done based on trying to satisfy majority of backers (hence 60% already paid)
2.  Jason has already told you that his production team will get both batches out on time.
This is contradictory to the "all or nothing" position he had initially taken; however I have to imagine enough guys like yourself threw tantrums, that he found a way to keep everyone happy (or at least try).

I get that people are pissed off at the battery and shipment statement that onloop made. First he says that the upgraded version will be delivered sooner and in the next post he points out that the battery upgrade is still for sale. I think that sparked some people here.

Seeing the position onloop is in though.. I would have done the same. In my eyes he's going through all kind of loops and hard work to deliver us the best product he possibly can. That is also the best move because the current target audience is a niche that compares e-boards and reads alot of reviews to say the least.

You have my full support Jason!

You are not able to change the trucks from my understanding. It has a special way of mounting.

The adjustable trucks in the video will be available later down the road as a separate purchase.

wider trucks?
[/quote]

why wider truck.... if it's about stability, you could just get a good setup of bushing or some angle spacer... at 10 inch of wheel base they are wide enough to be stable at high speed (like most of the downhill board that go speed up to 60+ kph). 
Also these are not regular cast truck, these are precision truck, they are meant to be more "precise"...

Final sample arrived, was about 2 weeks overdue! But i'm very happy with the last minute changes i made on this.... It really feels like a piece of art now...

* New handles are slightly recessed so they do not interfere with foot position on the deck surface.
* Microdrops to lock your foot, feels very secure.
* Vicious Grip standard.
* Slightly more aggressive nose & tail shape.
* Dark hardwood veneer. This is an added luxury that i simply had to have.

So isn't that going to give you different performance on a left turn versus a right turn? My thinking may be off on how weight distribution occurs during a turn- Assuming those trucks are driving to the right in the picture, a right turn will put you more on the outside edge of the right wheel and inside edge of the left...which are both the cross terrain bands. A left turn would put you on the 2 high efficiency bands...which would operate more like a standard wheel except for the very edge of the wheel. Or do the trucks tend to keep you completely balanced on both wheels?

The tread is symmetrical. It has 3 bands.

Cross terrain band | center band | cross terrain band. 

The wheel on a skateboard truck doesn't tilt, it is always at right angles to the ground, even when turning.. The left wheel is on the Same axis as the right wheel so they are always sitting on the center band.

I agree that you definitely do not want to delay shipping the R2 because of the Crossover Kit. I really want those wheels however.

If it were to ship interdependently, how much might shipping to the USA be?

I had seen adjustable angle precision trucks a couple of years ago and have lusted for them ever since. The ones I saw were far more expensive than what I was willing to spend though.

The R2 continues to impress.
The crossover kit looks nice and aggressive.

Questions.
Does the profile of the X-wheel load up the centre of the motor drum?
Can the motor easily handle the uneven central stress?
How far do you envisage that the R2 can you venture of racetrack type surfaces on the crossover setup?

By the way, thoroughly enjoying following the project and looking forward to delivery.

We can't guarantee there won't be extra fees tacked on by local european logistics companies. They seem have endless means of screwing people. We do intend on subsidising import duties.
[/quote]

Hey mate,

can you elaborate on this? My current impression is/was, that all european orders will be dispatched to us from an european location? (Or will you now dispatch individual orders from outside europe and ship directly to the customer - leading to import taxes for every european customer?) 

Also another question:
I teamed up with a member from the Forum on the kickstarter to order together - back then you announced that even if it is a group buy, you will ship the orders individually. How will you handle this?

Third question:
Besides the offroad pack - will we be able to buy extra wheels as replacement when we ride them down?

Last but not least:
Thank you for all these updates - Its amazing to see how things fall into place ;-)

Our long-term goal is to have EU distribution/fulfillment warehouse setup, but negotiations have not been coming along at the appropriate pace, so we will probably be forced to ship directly to our backers to begin with. This will eventually change when we establish a better fulfillment chain for our European customers. 

We will ship using duty prepaid methods, however, from experience, local couriers can still charge our customers random unexplained fees. We have no control over that.

Yes, our entire business is in the process of being restructured to focus on the primary Raptor 2 product. This means spare parts & accessories will be in stock & ready for immediate shipping in the near future. Due to the same reasons listed above we are still working on this, so they are not listed on our website at the moment. In talks with Amazon UK.

So sick! I was originally planning to switch the board out to a downhill board that i am familiar with, but this design is almost exactly what those boards look like. Gonna leave it as is now...especially like the dark wood veneer. Reminds me a lot of some of the Arbor downhill boards that I love:

Hey Mare,

Very much appreciate that you took the time and clarified everything.

@Ezzs
As far as I understood Jason, he will cover the import duties upfront. However some shipping companies might claim a fee from the recepient for handling the part with customs.

I had this issue on a package (unrelated to enertion ) received via FedEx. They claimed additional 20 euros for handling customs (to which I never agreed for them to do .... ). 
 
Please correct me if I missed the point @onloop

ok, I hope you are right. I did type it for i did think he hade problems geting someone i europe (EU) to send out all the boards. Do he have a service place in europe?

If he send from a EU country then all of us in EU will be very happy for we till not need to pay any extra like VAT (25% Sweden) + customs 3-15%. then that the shipping companies take out a fee dont happen or moste likely not happen. for its easy to send stuff from one EU country to another EU country.  I got very happy when he did say he plan do ship from Europe to all in Europe.

I believe the Australian VAT is deducted for overseas buyers when ordering online from Enertion website, so it should be closer to 15% (correct me if I'm wrong). I think Raptor 2 is priced well so in my opinion it's worth it still. But the major problem for me is that when something breaks sending back to Australia means high shipping costs and longer waiting times.

@onloop , I am fairly close to pulling the trigger (even though I'm a bit sceptical about how easy it will be to get support being in the UK). I'd go for the Mellow, however the 4x4 version that could compare with Raptor's torque and have satisfying range is just too expensive.

I'd like to ask a few questions first.

With Raptor(1,2) you seem to aim for the enthusiast group, marketing primarily on speed and torque. I am not a skateboarder yet, my intention is to learn safely and use it for commuting to work every day on a 6 mile long cycle path, so I don't care much about the top speed (I appreciate range and torque though); I just like how you seem to have picked the components and engineered the product -and I like the competitive price.

a) Realistically it is unlikely that I will push the board over 15-20mph. Is the VESC programming and the remote accommodating for a slower rider or will the power will be scaling too steeply? Is it expected that we understand the VESC configuration and play with it or are the variables too cryptic?

b) Do you think that your design of the board is significantly more demanding for a newbie to handle (stability, manoeuvrability) and learn than other boards?

c) It was mentioned that you have someone in the EU that can offer repairs if needed. Is that true? If so, if i.e. the battery develops a fault during the warranty period, would we send it to him or to you in Australia? Does the parts warranty include shipping? If not, where would they ship from and what sort of costs could we expect?

d) About the "duty prepaid methods" that you have mentioned for shipping to the EU, how does that work? Would we  preorder now and pay online for the ex-VAT price and at some point (how soon?) you would provide us with the quote for the duty/VAT and a way to pay it? Will EU orders get to the back of the queue for some reason or will it be FIFO (I am hoping to have the board no longer than mid-July, as I probably won't be able to use it past October)

Thanks

PS. I understand you're not properly in the EU market yet and I'm not expecting the kind of support that I'd get from a company with local presence, I just want to know if it's still viable.

You can ride the raptor 2 to beginners mode with one flick of the switch on the remote, i suggest starting off in this mode, its much safer. This is the simple way of limiting the performance. I tend to think many people will like this mode as its much more relaxing.

Also, the VESC app can be used to change performance modes too. You can choose from 3 different modes and also limit top speed if you want using the app. This is probably a bit more advanced than a simple switch, but not at all hard if you are comfortable using a phone app.

You could also make custom throttle curves too.

Heaps of user control over performance.

I think for anyone who hasn't ridden many skateboards there will be a learning curve, does not matter if it is electric or non-electric. Getting your bushing adjusted correctly is the most important thing you can do. It's really something that must be tuned to the rider's weight. read this guide: https://www.muirskate.com/longboard-guide/bushings/intro/

Our plan is to diagnose faults using videos & email and send replacement parts. We will have detailed videos showing how to do the basic repairs. If it's too much trouble & you prefer someone else to manage it that's fine too we have a repair agent in Belgium. 

You will never be asked to send anything to Australia.

Duty prepaid is handled automatically by the freight forwarding provider. They pay the taxes when the goods are passing through customs & send me the bill. First orders will be processed first.

Bushings are going to be a trial and error sort of thing. Luckily they are pretty cheap and you can try out a few. I'd recommend taking your board to a local skate shop to get some hands on help. 

It sounds like you are going to be doing slower speed cruising as part of your commute. Here's where you can start: https://www.muirskate.com/longboard-guide/bushings/cruising
Check out the weight guide and determine how stiff you want your ride to be. Stiffness here relates to how easy it is to turn. Flexy will allow you to make turns very easily without having to do a lot of leaning. However, it will be harder to just maintain a stable straight line. Similar to a snowboard, you may find yourself going turn to turn or edge to edge with this setup and not staying flat. A stiff setup will make those straight line runs much more stable, but you will need to do a bit more leaning to get your turns in. Turns will be something that you may struggle with as a beginner. You need to lean over the edge of the board to activate the trucks and this doesn't always feel natural...especially to your heelside. Toeside turns are easier to have confidence because you can see the ground. Leaning backwards can feel intimidating until you get a feel for your board and how much you need to lean to turn. One other thing to keep in mind if you ever plan on upping your speed- a stiffer setup helps tremendously at speed. Speed wobbles can be scary and you will want to revisit your bushings if your confidence grows.

Bushings are cheap though, so it;s easy to change a few around until you get just the right setup for your ride style...or to stiffen it up once you start taking on more speed. One other thing that I would recommend if you are truly a noob to boarding- a balance board like this can really help to build some basic balance and key leg muscles that you will need. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ABE15G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

One final piece of advice- go grab a regular push skateboard from a friend and practice a bit before you get on an electric board. Learn to footbrake. There will come a time where the batteries will go or your controller will disconnect and you will need to know how to brake without electronic assistance. Don't try to figure it out in that moment. It's going to be a few months before the R2 comes out. Get some practice in on the basics now and you'll be fine when the time comes to get your esk8 on.

We were all beginners at one time so it's important to remember that and take the time to help others that are just discovering this awesome hobby. I also think it's a smart idea to get in on a board that you can grow with. My first electric was a boosted and I quickly found out the range left a great deal to be desired. You won't have that same issue with the R2 so you are starting in a good place.

 I'm a noob when it comes to the programming of these boards but stoked to learn how to program and fine tune the VESC to meet my needs. I'm sure I'll be asking lots of noob questions when that time comes. 

You are absolutely right about the protective gear. I should have mentioned that. Gotta protect your melon! Enjoy the ride!

more efficient when the R1 had better mileage even though it used BLDC compared to the more efficient FOC?
Top speed win was also due to the major voltage sag you had on the R1.

The R2 seems like a great product - you don't have to use fake news to convince us ;)
I really like the FOC use, the silence and stealth plus coasting ability. Looks to be a worthy successor to the R1.

Yeah. Riding sensored hub motors in FOC is a totally different user experience. The lack of transmission and motor noise actually makes it _feel_ less powerful or something, whilst somehow making it feel smoother and more Natural too.

But the feeling of less power is an illusion. Its just so smooth!.

The first time I tested R1 vs R2 I was confinced the R2 was not meeting my performance expectations. Then When I reviewed the footage I realised it easily‚Äã outperforms the R1.

The R2 is next level. Raw power, very exciting to ride and so smooth.

The carbon layer on external faces just isn't practical. As much as I really do love the look!

It's very hard to get the finish quality perfect. It requires much more time too to achieve a near perfect result and this drastically impacts productiin scalability and more specifically means people will be disappointed if they have blemishes.

Also. The other issue is that the carbon fibre layer on top is mostly covered by grip and the bottom layer is mostly cut away meaning it has no structural advantage.

I think I have made the correct decision integrating the layers into the deck.

Regarding laser cut letter on grip... I also really like it!
But it's just not durable. The lettering always gets damaged.

I really want the R2 to be super durable and strong and sometimes I have to make compromises‚Äã to achieve that.

Have you considered using something like the 3M Scotchgard or a transparent protective layer on the bottom finish to protect the dark veneer  from scratching and the wood itself from stone impact? Just an idea probably already started production anyway, besides I can just do this myself when the R2 arrives.

Why not use print on the griptape tho or does this not work on coarse griptape? I've used plenty of griptapes with intricate prints on  that lasted as long as the griptape itself.

Can be a good thing to do a update on Kickstarter for i dont think all backers look at this forum.

I like that the board dont have any big text on it. Looks very cleen.

I agree the grip tape needs some logo printed on it somewhere either enertion logo or raptor 2 on it, it will finish the product off nicely and that way when people ride your board on the streets and on youtube your board will be easily recognizable.

When peeps see the Raptor 2 (or Enertion) logo on your deck, they'll infer Performance + Reliability.  When it's a blank deck, it might as well be a knock-off from China.  Just as Boosted and Evolve have logos on their boards, it would be inconceivable that Jason would allow his 'Greatest ever Achievement / Creation' in line of his market goals to be left Unknown ( = market loss before you're out of the gates).

You mean like this.... ;)  Yeah, it's a beauty but inline of getting production out earlier is the tacit reasoning for not having it like the pre-production shown.  If Carbon GT edition for Evolve sells like hot cakes, Enertion might just at a future date have a Raptor 2 Carbon Edition given that numbers are up and production has ramped up.  Clue me in early Jason!  So that I can start saving Again! for the Carbon Edition ;)

I get that but when you think of a boosted board you think of orange, not the logo on the board, the blue or greenish blue accents are what will show that the board is a raptor not the fact that it says raptor. This is how you build a brand by associating everyday colors or items with the object, think of red and soda(coke) Yellow and Phones(sprint) etc

Let's face it. Most people aren't going to make a $1k+ investment based upon someone they saw ride by with a logo on their board. They are going to stop and ask you about it and what you think before they pull the trigger. The best thing that Enertion can do is to get us a bad ass board with all of the specs they have been talking about. It destroys anything currently on the market, and people will notice the performance. The only thing I want them to laser cut is my name on the shipping box.

I just figured he'd want to put his branding on it, as I'm sure he is proud of what he has achieved with it. This has nothing to do with what the customer wants. Just leaving his mark on a product he spent the last year or more of his time developing, which ultimately is his decision whether he wants to do so or not. It was not intended to spark a statement of opinions.

But on that note. Let's face it. Not everyone has the time or interest to stop and talk to every curious person they pass along the way and hand out Enertion details. The Enertion logo won't be visible either when you are traveling at the speeds R2 is capable of. People do their research online before pulling the trigger and what will hold ground are the video/text reviews of the final product. How well the negotiations go through for his global distribution network will also play a role, as this will impact the speed of his customer service and the price of shipping (as well as import tax) for replacement parts when they fall under warranty or otherwise.

That being said not everything in business goes according to plan especially when dealing with 3rd parties. I'm certain as soon as he is finished dealing with his manufacturing lines and shipping out the ordered products, he will shift his focus onto the distribution network.

Saw an update from onloop on the electricskateboarding reddit. Thought I would share for those that aren't checking over there regularly.

onloop  Raptor 2 FTW
Sorry guys super busy this week. I'll do another update next week. Hope to have the battery case and a fully assembled final version of Raptor 2 for show & tell session.
The injection molding factory are fucking killing me at the moment....they are still tuning the molds for battery case. Well overdue. But super critical not to rush them.
In summary, everything is in full swing production. "Organised Chao's" Should have lots of photos of bulk part's sitting around waiting to be assembled from next week....

Buut i mean, service vise thats OK. It's just sad to see all the gravel on the roads being finally swept away after winter, all the while longing for the glorius unpacking of the beast. And now i can't ride my comfort blanket either :weary:

Definetly a normal longboard. If you are learning the  amazing fun that is sliding you will eat shit ( a lot) and so will your board. It will flip, scrape and run away from you. So no reason to sacrifice a new esk8 to that process. Also special wheels and less weight help a ton in getting started. 
If you can let a friend help you!  
Most impotantly have fun learning it!

I'm interested in getting some slides going on my R2 also. There are plenty of videos out there of people doing cool slides and slide tricks (donuts, etc.) on electric boards. Having speed and torque control at your fingers opens the door to some cool outcomes.

You asked specifically about learning to slide and I think that will be tough on this setup for a few reasons...primarily because of the wheels. The wheels that we are seeing on the rear of the R2 are wide. The size of the contact patch on the pavement impacts the amount of force necessary to get a slide going. Wider gives you better grip, but makes initiating a slide harder. I haven't seen details on the durometer (hardness) of the wheel, but my bet is it will be towards the softer side of the scale. Also better for grip, but more difficult for sliding. Another factor is the wheel shape. The standard wheels have a hard edge on them. That hard edge is something you see typically on a downhill longboard to help give better grip around corners. The wheels also have a polished finish on them and that type of finish increases grip. Until you wear that finish down, slides will be more difficult to initiate and may have a little chatter to them (not a smooth slide). I asked Jason earlier about the possibility of a stone ground wheel sometime in the future. That type of wheel is easier to break in for sliding. Maybe Jason will consider that for a future option. Finally, with the hub motor setup, I don't know how the wheel will perform on a slide. Keeping the wheel attached to the hub is going to be important and initiating a sidways force on that wheel isn't typical. Maybe Jason can share more about how his wheels will secure to the motor and whether he has any concerns here. 

So all of that makes this setup one that is more difficult to slide on. That doesn't mean it can't be done...and speed is the great equalizer. At speed, it's easier to overcome all of those issues that I called out and break the wheels loose for a slide. But I don't think you want to learn sliding like that as it can go bad real fast. I'd suggest getting a downhill board with some smaller wheels, rounded lip, harder durometer, and built for sliding. Sector 9 butterballs are a good example of the type of wheel that you can learn to slide on.

Thanks for the information. I guess I should have gotten a carvon for sliding then. Doesn't matter though. I'm just thinking about what sort of tricks could be done on the raptor.

We don't have many hills where l live, by the Baltic see, so I won't even start to get into sliding then.

Guess that kicktail can be braught to use. But I'll have to practice some more before on my cruiser. By the way, it'd probably be smart to get a tail bone for the raptor.

I disagree. I think it looks better and is more functional without any cutouts in the grip tape. People ask me about my R1 all the time; they learn about it by talking to me when I'm riding it and not by reading a logo. 

I've had my foot slip on the R1 when it was a little wet where the grip tape is missing over the trucks.

Yes cutouts is pointless, but grip tape can be printed on, no one actually said they wanted cutouts. Either way doesn't matter anyone who wants it differently can change it themselves doesn't cost much nor does it take long to switch out.

## SHIPPING UPDATE

**If your order number is one of the 30 listed below it is 90% likely you will receive a tracking number at the end of the may.** 

If any of you don't get a tracking number here are the possible reasons:

1. We have just learned there is a big Chinese holiday called [Dragon Boat Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival) at the end of may 2017. This could mean we have no factory workers & also could prevent us shipping.... Not sure yet!
2. We might not actually have 30 units, maybe only 28 or 25 etc... really depends on how smoothly the production ramp-up goes. We will only ship 100% perfect units.
3. There are at least two major components that might be overdue. Motors & Some of the electronics. It's really coming down to the wire on these parts & we have no time buffer left.

Phew! That is going to look great then. The shitty grey gives you a chance to see the detail in your videos, but I will appreciate the black more. It will maintain the stealthy look. It looks nice how it integrates with the bottom of the board and has that piece that connects to the rear trucks.

Nice job on the enclosure, and for not making it white lol!  Hoping the black makes it disappear from site, more stealth like a built-in enclosure.  Not sure if glossy black or matte blends into the wood you chose, i usually go with matte but you probably went glossy.  Either way, great stuff!

I'm beginning to feel those that bought the booster pack (Samsung 30q pink cells and bt module) are funding the upgrade for **_all_** the raptors. If this is true, and the are no green cell 25r raptor2 batteries, then I paid $100 for an upgrade that some are getting for free.  
Since going forward, thre is no way to purchase a Raptor 2 _without_ the booster pack, I am assuming **all** cells ordered for the manufacturing line are 30Qs.

I'm smelling something fishy.

Don't try to be a smartass. You could fail, and look like a dumbass.

If anything your comment builds to the issue making it larger than it need be without adding any value to the conversation. In other words, if you see me writing about this as a problem as you've expressed it, your comment makes it (the problem as you see it) worse, not better. 

I never asked for "exact time that they ordered", or any such thing. Are you asking if I did because you couldn't figure that out for yourself? Or, was it rhetorical? I definitely didn't ask for anything related to payment or anything personally identifiable outside of the rather broad category of country ordered from. Do you think you I should ask for such information, because you can't figure out there's no need for that yourself? Probably not. 

You probably wanted to look smart and show off your Toy Story .JPG . To me, you simply seem like **an idiot armed with an idiom.**

It is what it is whatever the case may be. But really what difference does it makes. I paid for cause it was a good value and I wanted it. If I didn't pay along with a lot of other people then it might not have happened so it was worth it to me. Unfortunately in life there will be freeloaders. If they get a free boost pack then so be it.

I think that order specific questions/complaint should probably be posted to enertions website (contact us or chat) rather than here on a public forum where he might not see it for weeks.

As for fairness, that word is very over used now a days.   There is nothing in his business documents (that I've seen) or brand that states "fairness", so why the feeling that you need to be treated fairly?  Jason is fully within his right to do what ever he wants.  He could ship to 30 random people, or the 30 people that paid the most (or that bribe him :P ), or that have red hair, or that he likes.    

Fairness is not a requirement.  Why are we acting like it is.   Every business owner has the right to tell me to take my business elsewhere or ship as slowly as they deem necessary.   

Anyways, **I'm excited for my board**, whether in May or Aug. (or anywhere in between).   I could of bought a boosted/torqueboard and had it by now... but I didn't and I'm happy with my choice.

## DECK FACTORY IN FULL PRODUCTION


**Hardwood veneer layer for top & bottom of Raptor 2 deck**

**Carbon fiber & epoxy layers prepared for layup**
The top layer of Hardwood Veneer goes directly onto the carbon fiber, plus a 2nd layer of fiber (two maple layers below) this ensures the fiber sheets remain intact in the top half of the deck! 
We are CNC'ing a large slot for the battery box on the bottom half of the deck and won't be cutting into the fiber layers.

I kinda hesitate to reply, as the first 30 isn't "kickstarter related" and I got bashed for bringing up a topic related to them, here, earlier. Even though Jason himself did so earlier in the thread. 

Anyhow, from a recent post It seems the first 30 are almost certainly delayed, and may not even exists any longer, as such (_FIRST_ 30).
[quote="onloop, post:24, topic:23178"]
Considering recent developments on scheduling it is unlikely we will ship an advanced 30 units anyway. We will most likely be shipping approx 500 in one batch in late june. I'll provide more info about this later in the week.
[/quote]

There may still be chance to see an early shipment, even if it's a slim chance. I guess we _should_ hear something more concrete later this week.

The plan was to head to Shenzhen last week of May and setup our production line and build 30 units and perfect the order of operations for assembly and setup our factory lines for maximum efficiency, train our production engineers and last but not least box & ship out the first 30 r2's... This would mean June we would be primed up & could just pump out units!
 
However, Just over a week ago we learned there was a National China holiday at the end of May. Combine that with the weekend days and out of the last 7 days of May there are only 2 working days.

We have been scrambling ever since this discovery to bring our trip forward. We nearly pulled it off! 90% of the parts would be ready... But it's super risky..  If we go to Shenzhen and can't build the complete product, we also can't‚Äã do testing and training. 

Potentially would be a huge waste of time. The risk is we possibly wouldn't get to see the entire process of the production line functioning and have to leave an unfinished task. 

So we have decided to combine the ramp-up stage into same week we commence the bulk production. We will fly to Shenzhen first week of June and now we can be there to control the ramp up and also witness the full scale production.

If everything goes really well 500 units could be shipped before end of JUNE.

I'll keep updating as more news comes in.

I've backed a bunch of Kickstarter and indigogo campaigns. Half involving esk8s. Most  (when I say most I mean 99%) of these crowd funded campaigns never deliver on time.  I've almost waited 2 stinking years for a stary board and it's still not delivered yet.

Jason even being a couple months late would still be awesome.   And in the state of the eskate market with those not delivering, I say he's doing really good.

In other exciting news I will be taking a documentary film maker with me to Shenzhen! I want you all to experience this journey with me.

In fact, starting next week will be the first of a 4 part mini series that will give our backers a behind the scenes look into small business, crowdfunding, esk8 building and manufacturing. 

The first episode will be a bit of the back story about enertion and how the raptor 2 was born and also show us preparing for our trip to Shenzhen. In ep 2 & 3, will show the factory setup and i how the raptor 2 is assembled. Will have a new video each week. The final video will show the finished raptor 2 being released in the wild! 

This is one of those stories that I can look back on with my kids and be proud. I hope it is motivational for them (and others) as it proves you can do anything you want you just have to believe.

You already know that @onloop stated that he will cover regular taxes and fees (excluding additional fees shipping companies may charge) - so what is the point in asking this question (or asking for someone to prove you something) ?

Facts are:
- it is state that it will be covered 
- no one has received their raptor2 yet meaning: no one will be able to state wether or not that claim of covering the costs is true.

So only thing to do right now, is to take enertion/jason by his word that things will be taken care of. And if (and only if) it turns out somehow differently act on the result (meaning: get in touch with enertion/jason and sort out the tax situaton). 

So until then - **keep calm and wait for your raptor2 to arrive**

This is a masterpiece.
I recently realised why I only preordered the Raptor 2 so late as last week and not before, and the reason is that I never saw it as a good looking board. Some people might think its superficial but it had a strong impact on me. I didn't like the round design, the battery cover, I hated the gloss carbon fiber bottom layer, the blue accents, the huge grip tape cut outs and especially the light wood outline/border of the board. IMHO it looked cheap.

And in the last weeks you took last minute decisions to change all of those things, and more. Agressive front and tail, dark veneer wood, no cut outs, no blue lines, no visible carbon fiber, the handles seamlessly integrated to the deck..

Because of those minor and bigger changes, the board went from looking like a badly tuned Nissan GTR to a Nissan Nismo (hopefully someone will now what I'm talking about). It is now one of the best looking design in the market, a pure and mature design, night and day difference from its initial design or the Raptor 1.
I applaud you for making all those modifications, and I can't wait to receive this beauty.

I dont understand why people are getting worked up over this. I paid for the boost pack because I wanted the upgrade to happen and it was a good value. Who cares if a few freeloaders get it for free. If myself and 85% of the others didn't pay then no one would have gotten it. So it was well worth paying a small amount to make it happen. Jason said he needed 90%. He's at 85%. Close enough I think.

i'm not getting mad if that was directed towards me, 

what I am suspicious about though is if the raptor 2 can go 40km/25miles in a single charge at a _reasonable speed_ i.e 15-20 mph without the boost pack. 

I suspect and I hope i'm wrong that the raptor cannot achieve this without the boost pack which is why Jason was so keen on getting this out to everybody, or he is just a nice person and wants everybody to have a 25+ mile range.

There were also delays earlier on that were outside his control that pushed him into further delays because of holiday schedules he could not have foreseen running into.  Remember his original goal to get things shipped out early May.

How guaranteed is the fact that you will be shipping it "duty & tax" prepaid to Europe? On your website it says the customer is responsible for all customs charges and when I talked to the support they said the same thing. However on stream you said it will be prepaid. I don't know what to believe now and it's kind of a huge difference because it would be an extra ~‚Ç¨400 for me probably.

Yes, Our plan is to ship duty prepaid. But as usual everything related to shipping products with batteries globally, Or shipping anything globally is subject to unknown variables.

Out terms and conditions by default say that the customer is responsible for duties because that is our normal terms. 

The raptor 2 is an exception. We have always said it will be with duty prepaid. We eventually plan to send via bulk to Amazon which will also be DPP.

Well ofcourse you never get anything for free. All companies shipping duty prepaid either write it out explicitly, or it's already included in the price. 

According to Jasons statements, it's the case of the  latter, we already paid for it.

Which would come as a happy suprise to me, we have a 25% tax here in Sweden and that would be quite a kick in the groin, when i ordered i was expecting to have to pay that later... Altough that pain would be offseted by getting a raptor 2 at the same time so who cares! :smiley: 

BUT!  Now i'm more optimistic, and even tough i also agree with Jason about international shipping and customs being irrational Dicks, that fee will most likely be under 50‚Ç¨/55$/500sek(or even less), and that would also apply to any package.. Stupid dhl. Well it might arrive without any fee aswell but like, this is Sweden so probably not.

Hey Jason, I saw a video from another company with hub motors calling out the fact that the electric braking system was unavailable over 50kph due to the regen power being too great. Have you tested the limits of the braking system on the R2? Do you have similar technical limits and if so, at what speed?

They are not using a VESC then or they need to adjust their settings.

I can tell you personally I have been up to 38 mph (61 kph) with no issues of braking, and logically, with a VESC, it doesn't make any sense. The VESC has limits that prevent you from pulling too many amps from your battery (acceleration) or your motors (braking).

That being said, this board is not even going to be close to those speeds, so it's really a non issue with the raptor 2.

The area I live in has a decent amount of hills. I tend to let the board run as much as I can handle in those situations. Knowing when I can no longer rely on electric brakes and need to solely rely on downhill skills is in an important piece of knowledge I'd like to have. It may be that the electronics of the VESC give braking capability well above speeds that I will be traveling, but I'd like to know for sure.

[/quote]

I'm telling you for sure that this will not be an issue. The vesc will limit you from pulling to many amps from your motors and throwing them into you battery. What you will experience is weaker breaking at higher speeds or on downhills. The fix is easy though, put a higher regen limit in the BLDC software of the VESC. I live in one of the hilliest cities in the world, San Francisco, and I'm not a light guy either (over 200 lb). I do speeds far higher with essentially weaker VESCs, and have no issues with braking. If you understand what's going on physics wise in the VESC, you'll see that the VESC was set up to prevent these sorts of issues. This one of the reasons it's become the staple of the Electric Skateboarding Community.

However, you should never rely on a manufacturer to give you a product that can't fail in some way, shape, or form. Always learn how to ride non motorized boards well, and always have a back up plan in case for some reason, your going downhill and lose brakes (like your remote connection dropped out). Learn to fall also. Wear long sleeves (the thicker the better) if you plan on going above 20 mph, or even 15 mph. Road rash sucks. Wear a helmet, preferably full face like the TSG Pass helmet. Use some common sense and you'll be fine. It's not like this boards going to have a very high top speed. Besides, there's more important potential issues I'm worried about with the raptor 2, but that's another story I and others have already expressed.

That's good to know. I have some downhill experience on non-electric boards and have made my skin sacrifices to the skate gods. Completely agree about being prepared to control your speed without power. I just wanted to know exactly where that line is. I'm in the TSG Pass group buy to upgrade my helmet and will probably grab a motorcycle hoodie to give me some extra protection just in case. Still trying to figure out how to get a slide puck on my remote hand. If I need to throw down a coleman slide at speed, I will feel much better about it if I can put both of my hands down. 

While I'm not new to skating at speed, I am new to the programming side of eskate. Excited to learn about it though. I think the R2 will be a great way to wade into those waters and understanding the BLDC and the parameters on the VESC...I mean FOCBOX...will be high on my list of to do's. I didn't know about the idea of losing braking power as speed increases, but it makes sense and I want to learn more.

The raptor is a great way to get involved in the community and understand more, since your using the basically the same software and hardware as most of the community. You can tinker with something which works and learn, instead of getting frustrated trying to learn while building your first board.

This industry is still very new. It's only been a a few years since the VESC was even created.

I like that the raptor is reaching out to those with little experience in the industry, but I wish there was like, a required crash course about how this stuff works and how to tweak it to your likely. Every complete producer hypes things that most can't put into context. Understanding this industry and how these things work help you to put claims in to perspective, and divide the truth and the BS.

Hey @onloop, I just realized something about the boost pack on your site and why we're not at 90%.

I already purchased my Raptor 2 and the boost pack. But still, I checked your website recently to see more information about it and I realized its almost impossible to find the boost pack purchase page. 
If i go on your webisite and click on raptor 2, there is no information about it from what I've seen, same thing if I go back to the home page. 

It's an organisation issue. you have them both linked on this page http://www.enertionboards.com/buy-electric-skateboards-online/ but this page isn't really accessible from the home page. People should see and read about the boost pack straight after clicking on "Raptor 2" at the top of your page.

Re-design the Raptor 2 page, and have information about the boost pack visible when people buy the Raptor 2 and on the home page. Because there's no chance people purchasing the raptor from the link at the top of your site are aware of the boost pack. Maybe i'm missing something but I challenge everyone to easily find the boost pack on the website. So far the only way is to click on Raptor 2 or on the Raptor 2 image at the bottom, and then click on the previous link in the directory at the top called "NEW: Raptor 2 Electric Skateboard ".

Sorry for my english.

and @vinividivici well if new R2 orders already have the boost pack, the boost back should be removed from the website.

Since announcing it i have been Emailing raptor 2 customers directly with the link. Also it's a recommended product linked to the R2 & it's linked from Kickstarter and this thread. So overall I think I we did a good job getting most to upgrade.

As of June the boostpack will be included by default and the product will be removed from website.

I have been using it for about a year and a half, got two physical cards -although they're not necessary for online orders- and have spent about 8600GBP through it. I have at least 3 friends that use it regularly as well. 

They have started setting certain limits, particularly in cash withdrawals, to promote their subscription service, and starting selling additional services, so they do seem to have a legit model (at first I thought it was too good to be true as well).

Of course I'm always wary and don't leave a high balance in it, because, you never know.

@maverail generally regenative braking only works when brakes are applied. If coasting then no it would not produce power but there are some manufactures that will leave the brakes on very slightly when you release the trigger creating a bit of drag and that does create power but then thats not really coasting is it?

My theory is that the VESC does regen a little bit while coasting (though insignificantly). If you spin the motors by hand fast enough, the VESC will turn on, and if it's connected to the battery and voltage generated is high enough, should charge the battery.

The motors can definitely produce current when they are not braking, however, the FOCBOX is designed so it doesn't regen from that.

You can see in this video, i go from full speed to coasting. NO REGEN

https://youtu.be/Pfu2BoXPB7Q?t=5m28s


In this section, I do apply the brake, you can see negative motor current & you also see the charging amount increase.

Well thats good news. Im sure some will be happy that those that didnt pay for the boost pack will get 25r batteries not 30q honestly i dont care i payed to make sure i got the 30q.

Hi the raptor 2 will be my first e-board and i'm concerned about handling the speed. With the system setup would it be possible to limit the top speed of the raptor 2?

Also im curious if it would be able to be able to program multiple speeds like the boosted board or acton blink s.

Note: I've also purchased the battery upgrade so I will be getting the performance app, not sure if it would be possible to do some work from there?

Thanks for the valued order.

The R2 is definitely going to scare you if you use it on max settings.

Fortunately there are a few built-in‚Äã options to change performance. The nano-x remote has a beginner mode which you should definitely use on the first ride.

The Android app also has some nice options. There are 4 different modes preset for R2. Infact there is the option to create and save your own perfect preset mode using the app.

Jason Maybe I'm dumb, or maybe I'm not the only one confused about this. 

I thought that all new pre-orders (including mine a week ago) have the Boostpack included as you currently list on your website the specs of the standard battery at 432Wh?  Some forum members are saying it's included with all new orders and others are buying them separately.  

Is it just those who pre-ordered the board before the option of the Boostpack was available who are having to add it to their order now or is it everyone? 

Basically mate I just want to make sure Im getting the best board available. Do I need to buy a Boostpack separately or is it included in last week's R2 pre-order?

Cheers,
Mick

Orders From June 1st ($1499USD) boostpack included FREE.

Otherwise if you purchased before June 1st you need to buy the boostpack add-on.

(Note: boostpack was meant be included free from may 1st but I didn't increase the R2 price as planned due to delay in Production, so everyone got an extra month with lower R2 price and option to buy the boostpack)

Hi, I'm from Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  I ordered my R2 first week of May.  I assume I'll be getting my board around August.  No worries, I can wait.
My concern  is, when i placed my order, there was no option for the boosted pack.  Only the extended warranty (2 years).  So I assumed the boosted pack is already included.  to @onloop, please confirm I'm right.

All you do is complain man, how about you either drop your order or just wait for your board to get there. If you are so disheveled then back out. This is a start-up company, which is doing great despite being short staffed (who are all split up across the world) versus the large demand and growth it is seeing. They constantly address the issues that have been created and are extremely transparent. How about you go spend more money than you did on this board for a less-superior one.

He won't be able to answer the range question, since there are too many variables that would effect  the range. 

Think of it this way whatever duration a charge of the original battery would last, would be roughly 20% longer with the new battery. Although even that will have variables which would change that % figure.

thanks, so it is safe to say that the non-boostpack R2's range would be, at least, half of the claimed <40 km.?
still pretty impressive, if i may say.
also, not including the boostpack from orders before 1st of june is just a simple business decision.  i got no problem with that.  it just sucks :stuck_out_tongue:

## \#1756 Posted by: Gary_Winthorpe Posted at: 2017-06-03T12:16:16.351Z Reads: 264

This is my concern as well, I find it unlikely that the R2 will be able to achieve a range of 40km with a rider of normal specifications, by this I mean the rider will probably need to be under or around 100lbs while riding on a mostly flat road.

Just think about why there would be a necessity to add more range? If it goes 40km or 25miles already, going lets say 50km or 30m on a single charge seems like overkill. It does not make sense.

The only way it could make sense if the R2 was not able to go 40km without the boost pack and by adding an option for it, saves the CEO's ass for misinformed claims. 

I personally will test the range on a normal person's weight (i.e 140-180lbs) on a flat road, if it does underperform at least I have my 110% refund and if it doesn't I will be a ecstatic customer.

Congratulations in your hubris response, I see now why you get so much stick from the community. 

"Your motors are built in the same factory, I know this because I have visited it".

I think his response was fine, and it's a fact that all motors look the same to the untrained eye wouldn't you agree? Unless you have a phd somewhere that he's suppose to know about?

Now the motors might be coming from the same factory, did you inspect or check to see if they were put together the same way? Just curious that's all. Will the Tesla's model 3s made in the same factory as model S have the same spec? If so then damn, I should've reserved a few more.

We are in China. Did some factory visits to oversea final stages of key sub assembly's. QC all parts at our new facility.

Spent majority of time planning the line & trying to optimize for efficient final assembly. Some small issues with incorrect screws and some parts have been rejected. 

No Raptor 2 to be built until Wednesday. 

Just want to build & ride... But must be paitent and get everything 100% first.

Haha yeah i have heard the lazy thing as well, and from people taking their car to go four blocks! There's a thing called walking! At least if you don't have a board ;)

But yeah we have some quite strict laws here in Sweden aswell, i THINK an eskate would count as a segway sort of, limit is like 17km/h... Very low. Power wise though i think it's 3,5kW so thats pretty high. We'll see if/when they wake up, i have not been stopped yet. 

Sort of expecting the police to never believe the power of the board though haha, as long as i don't overtake them i think they will not suspect that my board has way more power that a moped!

**DAY 2 & 3** 

I came to China feeling very optimistic and thought I'd be riding on the 2nd day for sure.... wow! I was obviously being a bit too optimistic.

With over 60 custom made parts the Raptor 2 is proving to be a true challenge of my perserverence....

This is obviously a huge project for me and I'm learning that reaching my goal is not just a matter of preparation alone it's about affirmative action and hard work.

The biggest problems at the moment are suppliers who have missed their deadlines or didn't meet our specified tolerances, combined with a handfull of random unpredictable headaches, for example thread pitches on screws not matching nuts.... duh!

The good news is we are here on site and we have solved most of the problems, this is very rewarding process but also draining our energy. The bad news is we are running out of time and can't‚Äã afford any more unexpected hickups. 

If I haven't said it already, this is super tough both mentally and physically, I just finished a 14 hour day today and feel drained and anxious.. today was particularly tough, I had to make some very big decisions‚Äã whilst at our battery factory. 

They rushed pack assembly to meet our deadlines but the final result wasn't acceptable. I had to reject a large percentage of our batteries‚Äã and send them back for reworking. It's such an annoying situation because the battery would have worked fine but simply failed our QC criteria based on the pack dimensions... 

It took me 3 hours of demonstrations to teach the production manager how to resolve the issues and build the packs to our specifications to ensure the battery would fit correctly in our enclosure....  They promise to have them ready by Friday which is a very close call in terms of production and shipping deadlines. 

Here's some photos of the rejected battery

All of the other prep work is done and the most efficient assembly processes are starting to be more obvious.... 
Here are some pictures showing different stages of the Raptor 2 build.

Tomorrow should be our most productive day yet. All the parts will finally be finished to spec and we will build and ride the board! I'm sick of building already and just want to ride now!

Hopefully‚Äã tomorrow I'll update with photos of the final finished Raptor 2 going into boxes ready to be shipped.

Imagine something like, "We are having some setbacks still, some problem with X and this means we can so far only produce around 15-20 raptors every day for now..." 

WOULD BE PRETTY AWESOME! I mean, that would mean the raptors are starting their journeys to us and the countdown is on for real... way better than waiting for christmas haha! :D

Just because he didn't make a picture while riding doesn't mean he didn't ride... On the picture with the 2 raptors on the ground the wheels of the one in the back seems used to me.

going around a circle in the factory does not count as riding but might have caused those wheels to look like that.
The cleaim "he was riding them and you can see it on his instagram" is wildly exaggerated.
Let's wait for Jason to actually post a video of him - then we can all be happy.

We have no clue if there was even a battery inside the one in his hotel (I know the battery indicator looks blue but that could also be a reflection).

You alright mate? He posted 2 days ago that "hopefully tommorow he could send photos of the raptor 2 being shipped". So when he posted multiple photos of boards being ready and in his hotel then it's obvious we are going to ASSUME that he has already ridden on them. Why are you making such a big deal out of this when we are just happy that there's alot of progress and that we will most likely have our boards soon? Maybe he hasn't posted any pictures/videos of it because they want to make a proper video on it? Which was one of the reasons he hired moja to come with him. Filming and editing can take longer than just one day.

Also why would there be no battery in the boards in his hotel? That makes absolutely zero sense to take them to his hotel if there is indeed no battery in them.

Haha, well you are both right. It is however a bit odd, i would have expected something like "awesome to finally get to test riding the first rt2 of the line!!1!" in the description.

Though hella nice pictures, the board is looking sweeter every time i see it!

And as already said, maybe editing, promo reasons... I would think they are all pretty knackered after these days! Just posting an update might feel like a huge thing when you're really beat, also since we are so many watching i'm guessing he does not want to give some half-assed statement that will come back biting him later, just because he/they were tired but still wanting to keep us updated. I mean i'm fucking dying for an update but also feel their situation, so i can wait... just a little more ;)

I wonder though if they are en route home now or if they are leaving tomorrow? It should be around 22:00 there now. Anyways it'll be a great story to hear

**Day 4 & 5**
No board's shipping this week. Been working to around 11pm or later each night... Too exhausted to post daily.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/1/c19ff63662c70231615fcb656d1594ae7e83db38.jpg" width="690" height="388">

We have built 4 complete units only. This process of setting up an entirely new production line with a never before built product is harder than I anticipated.... Way harder! 

My cheif project manager, Fabien, assures me we have made great progress. He said to me that many products that are much simpler to build than the Raptor 2 have taken much longer to go from an idea into a reality.... Doesn't make me feel much better about the situation...

On one hand I feel disappointed and question myself about how we could produce faster... On the other hand I have realised that we have already achieved so much in so little time. So overall very mixed feelings...

**Here is a list of (some) issues we faced**
1. Wrong screw threads / types - resolved
2. Battery pack dimension issues - resolved
3. Box & Package quality issues - pending
4. Motor wires tolerance issues - pending
5. Motor wires connector size issues - pending
6. Battery enclosure parts delays - pending
7. Enertion sticker printing issue - pending 
8. USB cable issue - pending
9. Possibly more can't remember??
 

**Parts missing**
1. Box - first one rejected due to quality issues
2. Enertion product sticker - first one rejected due to size issues
3. USB cable - delayed
4. Motors - delayed reworking cables / connectors

**Outstanding tasks**
1. Document / video all assembly procedures.
2. Identify / document error checking criteria.
3. Optimize production line.
4. Design Build assembly jigs. 

In summary....Work. Work. Work... And more work...

We have all been working 15 hour days for the last week. Most of my team is heading home and going back to reality.

With my wife's blessings I've extended my stay in China by an extra week so I can continue to oversee the quality and production processes.... The grind continues.

Thanks for the updates.  Please continue to take the time you need to get it done right.  I think/hope I speak for most of us when I say that getting a properly made board is way more important than meeting a time deadline.  We are all excited to ride, but knowbody wants to deal with issues at the cost of getting the board quickly.  Take your time and stay positive

Yes lots of stupid problems.... It's‚Äã crazy how much detail we provide on everything but still there is always the possibility for communication problems or misunderstanding that ensures things get screwed‚Äã up.  

I hate to think what this product would be if my team & I where not here doing the hard work first hand! 

Now the challenge is to put systems in place that work reliably without my supervision. Fortunately, I am working with some very experienced production engineers that are based in China and they are putting process in place that I would never have even imagined. Mind blown.

I have learned one VERY important lesson. Building stuff in your garage doesn't scratch the surface of what is needed for a scalable mass production product. The difference is chalk and cheese. 

Today I built another ccomplete unit with the parts we had available, this build was filmed and photographed specifically for the build instructions which need to be completed next week.. Also today sent one R2 unit to our software engineer in Germany to do the final firmware tweaks to maximize efficiency and performance.

On a sad/lonely note; My core team headed home today so I'm feeling like this week is really going to be a big test of my perserverence and self belief. Fortunately I have the support of this community and my wife and kids to push me forward.

So Its Sunday tomorrow and I'll be sleeping in and having a day off to recharge the batteries. I plan to be relaxing as much as possible and also go for a ride on the Raptor 2 and soak up some of the local scenery. I'll try to get some riding footage & share it.

_Technically this is the first Raptor 2 being shipped! It's for our software engineer for tuning purposes though! So not really "offically shipping" yet_

Great work so far, looking soo good! 

Like others have said, don't forget to take some time to relax aswell. None will benefit if you burn yourself out, instead i think you should be proud of all the achievements so far. 

Have a coffee, enjoy the sun and a ride on the best board in the industry. 
I actually feel lucky that im in on the Raptor 2, there are other nice boards but... All lacking in some way. And built with the vesc and open source, this is just the future.

Updates like these are the main reason (maybe not main reason since the board will be the best out there in my opinion) that I decided to get the raptor 2. Jason totally seems to understand how it feels to invest a large amount of money in something you haven't felt or seen yet. Communication is very important in these instances and Jason is doing the best job with this. I feel proud to support Enertion unlike ACTON. I backed the Quattro also and they are the polar opposite over at acton. I am so disappointed in their lack of updates and communication and I feel like I've been basically taken advantage of by them. So even if their board turns out ok I'm totally turned off and I will not being supporting them at all. 
Enertion has my full confidence. 
Thanks and keep up the great work.

i read this thread from the start and cant find the answer that im lookin for.
im one of the guys pre-ordered around May2017.  So my order does not include the boost pack, and eventually bought one.
my question about the boost pack, is this another set of batteries? an upgrade hardware? or an upgraded firmware?
also my question from before, what is the standard range (ball park) for a non-boost pack R2?

@NummThumz, thanks for summarizing Jason's latest video.  that was awesome, I was LOL about that pink board.  props to you, mate.

Glad to help. As far as your questions, I can answer a few of them based on what he shared previously while we wait for Jason to respond. 

This video is the first time that Jason came out and said that everyone will get the boost pack regardless of whether they paid or not...though many of us suspected it. The boost pack is an upgrade to the battery cells used that will increase the range of the board. He also talked about including a Bluetooth module as part of the pack.

Boostpack is the same size and Wright but higher capacity cells.

And the capacity is 20% higher soo.. You can go 20% longer.

Real world use you prabably can go 30-35 km pretty reliable. I mean it's stated 40km for either with or without boost but, if you were gonna ecodrive then you probably would have gotten a bike instead so... 

I basically see it as 20% more fun.

now i get it, thanks to you all.  still pretty good range compare to its competitors, without the boost pack.
Jason offered to sell the boost pack to the people who ordered the R2 before June2017 (which he said was not included).  so i purchased one.  does that mean i'll get two batteries, or they'll just upgrade the battery upon delivery.   i was hoping two batteries :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.  but then again, for its price, its probably just an upgrade :unamused:.

The "boost pack" was a funding campaign to upgrade all Raptor 2s.  
All Raptor 2 will ship with the extended battery (it's just a different model of the cells that make up the pack) and the Bluetooth module. Think of it as a stretch goal instead of something physical you purchased. Jason offered an upgrade if he could get the extra funding. We provided. Score.

My order number is 11880 and I purchased from first batch, which was atleast a day before he made a post on instagram stating that there were 473 sold. 2 days later there was a post stating that all 500 from first batch were gone. So I don't think the 530 the other guy said is correct because then you wouldn't be in the first batch, but you should be because I am lol

they'll spot it in the X-ray for sure and then you'll be stuck at the end of the security line as they say you need to chose to leave the flight behind or leave the battery behind.

If you check it in as it sounds like you really mean...here's what I found as quoted from someone who works there:

Mark Lee, Transportation Security Officer
Answered Nov 26, 2016
The vast majority of the time, the owner of a bag with a prohibi item in it won‚Äôt be arrested or prosecuted. A lithium battery for example is a prohibited item if it's by itself. If there is something to put it in though, the officer can and should put it in so then it counts as an item that happens to contain a lithium battery instead of a lone lithium battery. The owner of a lone lithium battery won't be arrested. What will happen is the TSO will remove the item from the bag and contact the airline. The airline will send somebody down to the baggage area to collect the item. If the passenger‚Äôs flight hasn't left yet, the airline will contact the passenger and give him or her their options. If the flight has already boarded or departed, I'm not sure what the airline does with the item.

Thanks guys for all these clarifications. 
Well, it seems really weird to me that Jason didn't consider this issue when designing the Raptor 2... From what I've understood, he custom designed 2 cell holders to contain 20 cells each that compose the battery pack... Shouldn't those two cell holders be dividible and even be 4 (around 100kW each)  instead of 2 to be carried in a hand luggage?

i think, from his videos, he clearly stated the you wont be able to bring the raptor2  in a commercial air lines.
however, he wishes that we can bring the raptor2 to a plane, without the battery, and just make our own battery using local sources (whichever your destination is).

Well you'd even need to divide it into five pieces, so it is not very practical.. i think that and that making the battery dividable makes it more complicated, it takes longer to produce, more expensive, makes it bigger and less rigid and also that it would be another point of failure.

I guess that it would be possible though to make a smaller battery, a travel battery as an accessory. Either 1x100 or something like 2x 90 Wh, then you could possibly bring that on a plane? Would be pretty nice..

But i still prefer the current battery as the standard to any such solution, more reliable and more performance for "ground" use! :smiley:

The problem is not only holiday transportation but transportation in general, i.e. shipping it through courrier companies, due to the battery being classed as Class 9 Dangerous goods and (most likely) being uncertified by Enertion.

A certification might not be so complex to provide though (well, technically it might be as simple as enertion providing a written confirmation with each battery, although it's probably not wise without actually running the tests), so perhaps @onloop will consider it.

I have oppened a topic about it here:

For those constantly requesting airline possibilities. 
Making a 99wh battery is not hard to achieve. You might even get it trough security if the right guy is standing there.
If you want to be sure and avoid discussion. It needs to be certified and in a decent hard plastic cover. Which easily cost millions to achieve. M1 and boosted have thrown their money on that. So if thats what you want. You know where to get it...

Edit: and with the bans of the note 7. Laptop cabin restrictions and whatnot. It's a very sensitive topic at security

Hi Lyslampe,

I've just checked the chat log from Zendesk, and I wanted to let you know that you may have come away from your chat with the slightly wrong impression. If you were one of the last pre-orders, then your board most likely is NOT built as of yet, but it IS in the queue. As stated previously, we hope to get out some small shipments by the end of this month and fulfil the remaining pre-orders (first batch) by the end of July.

We appreciate your support and your patience - we know you all want nothing more than to hit the streets with these beasts!

Thank you for the clarification. I understand there is going to be different settings like beginner, intermediate and expert for example... so would I then need to use this software to change it as I get better? again this is naivety from having zero knowledge of it but I would have just assumed that the hand controller would have a sort of switch to change between the  levels. If the software needs to be used to change I hope someone will do a YoutTube video to help people like me :grin:

the remote that comes with the board has a beginner and advanced mode that you can change, switched up is beginner switched down is advanced, there are tutorials all over youtube that will give you a better understanding of how to use to bldc tool, Pretty sure that the top speed is still the same, just changes how quickly you get their, I think, I mean, that's how my remote and vesc x work. on advanced mode its a lot more touchy, move the trigger forward a little and you accelerate faster than you do if you go full throttle on beginner mode. https://youtu.be/dxDXUrk-7ek this shows you how to use the bldc tool, fairly certain its the same for the vesc x's, or foc box if that's what they call it now.

Curious what light you're looking at just made one on thingiverse for my own board that sits between the trucks and board but didn't see any retail options really for skateboards that were designed the same way (I have seen ones with the lights hanging off the side since I don't mind the big risers I just put the battery switch charge circuit and LEDs inside the little case).  My guess is the heat won't really be a problem for the LED circuitry most of the stuff is rated to deal with pretty high temperatures (non operational higher than operational but still high operational temperatures) I imagine so long as it has a plastic case there will be enough heat dissipation around it and it won't transfer heat that well off the truck into the light case so should in all likelihood be fine.

Since I have a built in lipo in mine that'd be the only real concern but mostly just that it will degrade the life of the battery I doubt if it would be warm enough to cause it to explode or harm any of the rest of the solid state electronics.

What happened to the actual updates? Would be interested in hearing when the assembly line is planned to go into full swing with the projected units built per day, since this is when orders will finally start being completed and sent off for those that weren't in the lucky 20.

More or less just interested in forecast estimate. I understand that allot of it is dependent on whether your suppliers meet the promised delivery dates, including if the parts pass the QC.

Sure technically Adrianenertion mentioned that you will try getting out some small shipments by the end of June and the rest by end of July, but its lacking details. Are these small shipments the original 30 or the revised 20?

Can't speak for enertion, but Jason posted updates on the YouTube channel 5 days ago https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFugBVZgaQ5fCp-kLmyWq1A based on his general demeanor I'd guess there's still some small hold ups in getting everything made but they did get the first production board assembled in the video (in China) so my guess is in a few weeks orders will probably start being fulfilled (again no insider info just speculating).

I unfortunately haven't had the cash flow to buy much from enertion yet but the company (Jason) has been super helpful and informative for the DIYers out there like me so I watch the videos still (hopefully can eventually throw him some cash too).

OK, so I got the email. For those that didn't, the gist is this:

Sorry that the DIY parts shipping hasn't gone smoothly. Transitioning to Amazon for the Focbox and Nano remote. The Amazon transition will let Enertion focus on delivering complete boards like the R2.

_Dear Enertion customers,_

_First and foremost, thank you to all of the people who have believed in, and supported us from our humble beginnings. From a community standpoint, as well as financially, it is YOU that have made Enertion what it is today._

_Enertion has come a long way from being a hobby which turned into an obsession, resulting in the fabulous ESK8-builders community and leading to Enertion creating and selling its own components to the DIY-eSK8 community. As many of you know, Jason, our fearless leader, began constructing his own boards, and was deeply involved in the DIY community, helping others to do the same. This led to the launch of the Raptor 1._

_Although it was regarded as a success, the board had some teething problems, and much was learnt about the design, manufacture and fulfilment processes. After 2 years of development we are in the final stages of launching the Raptor 2, set to be one of the best e-skateboards to have ever seen the road._


_Set to be one of the best e-skateboards_
_to have ever seen the road_
_Unfortunately, this has meant that Enertion must make the transition away from the DIY-parts industry. We are sad to no longer be selling the mechanical parts to make your own great e-boards (aside from clearance stock), but we want to focus solely on creating the best end-user experiences for our riders on their Raptor boards._

_We admit that the transition for this in our business has been less than ideal. Although we‚Äôve put our current stock of DIY parts on sale, we have failed in the timely shipment of many of these, mainly owing to the lack of human resources in the packing and shipping department, as well as restructuring of said department, due to the focus on the Raptor 2 fulfilment process._

_We are currently in the process of working hard with Amazon to handle our future fulfilment, with the hope that shipping will become much more efficient, and that products will always be available and in stock. We are also happy to announce that we will continue to sell our most popular products, the FOCBOX and Nano-X remote. Nano-X controllers are currently in stock and available for purchase, shipping immediately. The latest information from our factories is that FOCBOX pre-orders will begin shipping early-to-mid July._

_We appreciate your understanding during this transition process, and we wish you luck building/riding the board of your dreams!_

_The Enertion Team_

Doesn't really belong in this thread if it doesn't relate to the Raptor2.  Maybe he is referring to the delay of FocBoxes, inferring a delay in production of Raptor2s; but there seems to be something else weighing heavy on his soul.

From the email sent.

Updated Raptor 2 Delivery Timeline
14 Units: 1st half July
15-50 Units: Mid to Late July
51-500 Units: Late July to Early August
500-1000 Units: Mid September

 Thank you for your continued patience while we are putting the final touches in place to ensure that you have the finest e-skateboard that has ever been made. We apologise for the delays, which have arisen due to several unforeseen issues in the manufacturing process. The reason for this letter is to keep you in the loop regarding the actual timeline for your Raptor 2 delivery, and give you real data that you can base your expectations on.

Firstly, we know that some customers (especially the first 20 of our fabulous backers) are under the impression that their boards are on their way, and are simply awaiting a shipping number to be emailed. Although we have indeed made our first 14 boards, these are still, to our regret, not en route yet as we have identified more issues that need to be resolved before shipping.

Due to these issues production had to stop so that the necessary tooling changes could be done.

Current Production Issues

BOX DESIGN NOT SUITABLE FOR WEIGHT

Fault Summary: When packing the Raptor 2 we noticed that the quality of the packaging was not to specification and the product was not well protected.
Outcome: Product may get damaged during transit
Resolution: Redesign the boxes & Use stronger cardboard
Estimated Delay: 20 days
Status: Reworking already started 7 days ago

That was what I was expecting to hear. I've been so excited to have a good esk8 this summer (I spent my whole vacation savings on it), but if it isn't being delivered before summer is almost/completely over here in Sweden I have to cancel my order. Sadly, the Raptor 2 was the only board that I was interrested in. So I guess with no Raptor 2 delivered and a crappy Evolve with every part broken there will be no electric skateboarding for me this year... That sucks. I was looking forward to it so much :(

I can understand that with a growing company their are going to be set backs. It's just now everyday that gets set back is a day I don't get to ride the raptor2.

Yep. After 2nd email it's a little clearer.  He's upset he's out another 2 weeks and didn't have the heat to break it to us, so he made a decision to craft an informative email with realistic time frames. üëå Perfecto! üëå  

I wouldn't want it any other way.  Jason (@onloop)  definitely has the backers backs! I mean look at the small things he's willing to fix.  I imagine retooling the mold was on him. The boxes _probably_ would have made the trip, but 'ordered with stronger cardboard' so they'll end up at the doorstep _right_. No other company (especially esk8) has been willing to sacrifice time and money to get it this right.  

Thanks Jason for looking out for us and being so transparent. We have been bugging for an update... I don't think a week or so was so bad in hindsight. AND we're only a month off target for a ride that will last years.

I feel ya, similar situation here(mid/North Sweden). It's sort of a tradition that i wait all summer for some esk8 part and then ride in the fall, last year i was riding in late november. If the R2 lives up to my admittedly very high expectations, i'll probably ride it after the first snow too! 

As of now i would almost pay extra to get the board now and the proper parts later. But then again i would probably not agree to something like that as a company, too many loose ends. And nobody would let anyone forget such a stunt, bad for the image... Though.. Hopefully the R2 would still blow that memory out of everyones mind!! :D

I think Jason's only fault was that he was very naive about originally promising delivery in May (then June/July). He is now running into the same issues every e-board Kickstarter seems to encounter during scaling up manufacturing. The difference is he's going to be maybe 3-4 months late as opposed to 18+ months late like virtually all of the others.  The other difference is that Jason has been totally open and honest throughout the whole journey, which isn't that common either. 

Yes it's frustrating to us who have placed pre-orders, but not nearly as much as it is to Jason himself so let's cut him a little slack and try to be patient, knowing that the wait will be worth it!

Thanks for keeping us informed @onloop, we appreciate it. üôÇüëçüèº

I can't remember where I read this but "perfection is the enemy of profitability". Don't get caught over small details like the durability of a box, if it's not as strong as it could be don't throw away the existing one, just add a cheap one over it, both of them will reach the same recycling center :wink:

Things like the Battery box wire cover and FOCBOX not functioning properly should however be addressed and is. Extending the deadline in the long run will be much appreciated to the consumer instead of sending one that will break within 6 months.

The transparency is much appreciated, better to know what is going on then to be left in the dark.

@Gary_Winthorpe I haven't heard that before, but thank you for that pearl of business wisdom! Considering the fact the the other issues were causing delays regardless, we felt it an opportunity to also address the box issue. I, for one, was having nightmares that Raptors were going to arrive in boxes that looked like a Sumo wrestler'd had his wicked ways with! 

We're planning on keeping the Raptor 2 customer base as well informed as we can, via either video updates on Youtube or email newsletters, as many of you have received. 

I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the Raptor 2 community for their continual support - i truly feel like we're on this journey together, and by and large, you are some of the most understanding customers a company could hope to have. Kudos to you all.

No need to apologize, we all started from there.. and that's what this forum is made for. There's a FW version 2.54 for BLDC tool, developed by @Ackmaniac that explains every setting in detai, all you need to do is hover ur mouse over a setting for a second, then a description/example will pop up. There are also plenty of HOW-TO write ups on the forum, Google, and YouTube, that will guide u down the right path. You'll be surprised how easy it is. Being completely foreign, not knowing how to navigate ur way around is ur only real obstacle at first, but that'll change quick. U just need to know the specs of the motors and battery pack, to input a couple values. From there, it's really just how u prefer ur power curve/brake sensitivity, and tweeks depending on ur wheel size and gearing. Once u watch some videos on how to use it, you'll be at home with it. I was in ur shoes not long ago, and it seemed like such a hurdle, but it's really easy, especially with all the support from the community. Till u learn more and more, u can just scratch the surface w the basics. Hope that made sense, & sorry if it was one long run on sentence.. speak to text

I made some headlights of my own (I couldn't find shredlights though I'd seen them before so just designed and 3d printed my own)

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2397920

They've been working well and some guy stopped me the other night to thank me for having lights... sorta weird but makes sense, older guy probably has a hard time seeing people and was happy to see someone not being a moron.  My case above was designed to have a little switch, USB charge circuit and PCB with LEDs on it mounted in there (ideally was trying to design it so it could be 1 PCB which is possible but trying to get the price to be at least competitive with shred lights and still make some sort of profit).  The LiPo cells and recharge IC from linear technologies and the plastic parts are all what costs money, 90Degree diffuse SMT LEDs and other components are pretty cheap but think it worked out to about $20 to make them still which basically means I need to charge at least shredlights prices to make anything at all.  Anyhow if you've got the knowhow and equipment you also have the model (otherwise ya know just buy some shred lights :) )

Not saying it isn't great here I just want to see it before I put money down as I don't want to be dissapointed again like with the Inboard. Hope I can build a belt driven one myself tho but still trying to wrap my head around all this stuff.

I spoke to Moja and rode the R2 prototype myself. He is only push starting because they were still fine tuning some of the settings before production release.  The production models will have no issues starting smoothly from a standstill, and trust me when I say that Inboard is not even in the same ballpark when it comes to torque! Think Evolve GT, make the power delivery smoother then add extra torque and you're close. :slight_smile:

Yeah I was very lucky to get my hands on one. Aluminium handles make it feel like a serious weapon! Weight is heavy, about 10kg (22lbs) but bear in mind it's almost all motors and battery so it's 'good' weight if there is such a thing. When carrying the board by the handles the weight is definitely rear biased. I've purchased some shredlights and hoping that the extra weight might help balance the weight a little more to the front.

Hi @Jamy, sadly the default brackets doesn't fit in the back since the hub are a little big BIG :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:... But you could alway use the same bracket as in this video... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF0f68EVGKE 
Or do as I did and reverse one of the front light, so it light up underneath the board making you more visible to other people on the road..

For sure! That would be great, a great way to see more of the town and things you would normally not get to see.

Only downside might be travel company, if they don't have a board and therefore slow... I guess they could have a bike, if they can keep up. 

On that note, what are the guidelines about pulling/towing someone on the R2? It should have the power for it, within reason(i.e don't kill yourself/others, don't pull someone up a wall)? 

I have tried pushing someone on a bike with my current board, they were googly-eyed and laughing the whole time at the power delivered, could not believe it! The R2 is basically twice the power and four times the battery so should work? 

(as a side note, it is ridiculous how hard it is to push someone on a bike from the board!)

@FartofDoom The price on the Raptor 2 will only rise, at least for single units, unless we have a crazy sale of some sort. I doubt you'll see some of the early backer pricing though - that was in place to reward the folks who believed in us from the early stages of the R2, or just who wanted a really good deal at the time.

But never fear, bulk pricing discounts (not quite of the magnitude of the EOFY sale we just ran) will always exist. So if you're keen on getting a cheaper board, I would band together with your crew and try to organise a bulk purchase! That way no-one will be left behind when you hit the streets and pump the accelerator to the max on the R2!!

Yes the esk8 ones. The standard bracket works for the front. For the back the hubs are too big so they used the penny board bracket and only one back light.  Just get the  esk8 headlights (Water Resistant/Black) standard  and the Penny board (Water Resistant/Red). Don't forget to use the "GiveMeLight"  discount code, since that almost covers the shipping cost.

The esk8 version mounts on the top. You do not want that with the raptor on the back due to the kicktail. Moja on the video is using standard mounted shredlights and the rear is for the single tail light.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/d/4d4f48bd0f5aee2aa06a3ae1fd5e4067a3b1ef0a.png" width="281" height="500">

[quote="maverail, post:2045, topic:12694, full:true"]
The esk8 version mounts on the top. You do not want that with the raptor on the back due to the kicktail. Moja on the video is using standard mounted shredlights and the rear is for the single tail light.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/d/4d4f48bd0f5aee2aa06a3ae1fd5e4067a3b1ef0a.png" width="281" height="500">

Pretty sure I ordered correctly that just confused me. I contacted Shredlight support to make sure everything is in order just in case, better safe than sorry.

 Pretty sure Moja is putting allot of mileage on the board and having a blast. If he rode it on the ground in that picture well looks like sandpaper to me.

Good point about the dates based on the Shipping Updates email from June 27. Jason called out 3 items that were delaying the process. He cites an "estimated delay," so I'll use those dates to project when they might be resolved, but it's important to think about this being an estimate. With that said, I don't think we should expect any new information until these dates at the earliest.

Shipping Box- 13 days from email is July 10
Battery Wire Cover- 13 days from email is July 10
FOCBOX correcting capacitor- 16 days from email is July 13

So basically, we should not expect any new info before next Thursday at the earliest. There is no way those early boards get shipped without a FOCBOX fix. He can still technically hit the "first half of July" deadline if he gets those focboxes installed on the first 14 units on next Friday and then gets them shipped immediately.

I think by the lead time he means the time it takes for the parts to be finished and sent to the factory. I'd also think he gave himself a little buffer there in case they need some more time. Still hoping for a first half of July delivery of the first 15 boards :D

I already edited my original post to include the proper information revised after their response. The spacer kit (only needed for top mounting/ if you want 4 pairs of headlights for example, you need 2 spacer kits) is not needed. Just the standard bracket is needed for the front. For the taillights the pennyboard version (Red). Pretty much just ordered the spacer kit extra but no big deal that's like 2$ difference.

So good! Thanks for sharing. I am glad that beginner mode is comfortable. This is going to be my first eskate and I am not ready for 50kph just yet. You made it look really fun where as Moja appears to be an expert shredder who rides at scary fast speeds. If you get a chance, I am really curious to hear about full throttle mode from your perspective and also am really curious about the programmable accelerator software and the different presets which it's going to come with. Can the controller be ramped up gradually so that you can limit the fast mode throttle at first and then gradually increase the limit as you get better?

Think I found it out. It's that we usually mark them with percent over X distance rather than over the 100feet used here it seems. Hard to compare then but from the video it looks like it drives as steep as I would ever need :D

Just to compare, with a belt setup would it drop so much in speed at the top then and eventually stop or would it handle it better? I'm only used to hub motors and mine gradually drop off in speed and stop.

When he says 60a, my interpretation is battery amps, not motor amps. I said all along that the battery will be the bottleneck and it is. Jason can say all day that the 60a is enough, and for most people, it probably will be enough. 60a battery is still going to sag quite a bit though. And 80a would be pushing it.

Videos seem good so far. Those motors in the last video are not running FOC (or if they are, something is wrong). Hummies motors with the original bearings made no sound whats so ever, as do the carvons. If they are going to be loud like this, this will be a draw back of the raptor 2.

I'm not sure about the battery amps and all that, but I can assure you the Raptor 2 is almost completely silent. Something was definitely wrong with that particular board, or maybe that was the sound of the Carvon riding next to the Raptor 2? My hands on video shows the sound more accurately.

Yes & No, depends if the parts have issues or not, the parts that are fine we have all of them for 500 boards. But, for now, it's just 15 boards going out for now...

You might be surprised how tricky it is ramping up mass production, it's tempting to get everything made in one massive batch & sent to our assembly factory waiting for us to build with (which happen with some stuff). When you know there is nothing wrong with parts that is what you do and you can be confident. 

However, when you discover little fitment issues & random problems during assembly of some parts, as we have, you are glad you only got small batches of certain parts... some parts we have had to scrap totally, 4000pcs of one item... 

So the good thing with small batch is you can make changes, the bad thing with small batches of parts is it takes ages to get them....especially when making changes, each change is one-week minimum. 

So the first few we have to build are actually the slowest ones we will ever build. The next 30 - 40 we are going to be very cautious also. I think we will hit full speed last week of July, there should be no unknown problems, ill be back in China to oversee the full-scale production.

its very reassuring that our manufacturing partners are trying their best to keep up with us and do all the changes we have requested in a timely manner... so i am grateful of that.

Please refer to our previous schedule to understand our shipping plans

Wouldn't a 4wd board provide better tracktion on slick pavement and off road conditions? That's the only reason I am interested. You could set it up like an AWD transmission and supply more power as the wheel starts to slip by comparing speeds from the hall monitor sensors.

4wd doesn't necessarily mean more traction in every situation.

tread patterns, more contact area, material optimisation may result in more traction with the ground during normal riding situations.

4wd allows you to get more driving torque /power to the wheels. So can seem to improve forward drive when powered only..

My intuition tells me, that if you loose traction with the ground when riding / cornering, 4wd doesn't necessarily aid in the preventing the traction loss.

Maybe it aids in regaining traction? But this is also heavily reliant on the skills of the pilot.... Can you react quickly enough during loss of traction to hit the throttle hard in order to gain loss of traction / control.

The FOCBOX does have traction control function that can alter power output to individual wheels depending on rpm variables. If you have 4wd, with traction control and you hammer the throttle during a traction loss situation you might be able to recover better...  I seriously doubt there is a tangible benefit here.

4wd makes a huge difference in performance and if you actually put one together for shits and giggles @onloop, you'd see it and never want to go back. If you corner it too hard on 2wd, you can fish tail. This cannot happen on a 4wd. You spread braking and acceleration out, giving you more surface area to grip to the street. It's also more natural feeling. 2wd, you know where your motors are (whether you mount on the front or back, their is a noticeable difference in how you need to balance). With 4wd, you have an even acceleration and braking across the plain of the board.

More redundant also, so say one VESC or motor phase wire fails, you can keep riding.

I think 2wd with big enough motors is enough for most people. But I think if you can build  4 slightly smaller motors for the cost of 2 larger motors, why not? Extra VESC cost, but then, you can use the VESC 4.12 instead of the FOCBOX, so you can save their too (since your spreading the amps out across more vescs).

Our plan is to send a container to EU with the raptor 2 inside & duties pre-paid..... what your government/customs does from there is not in our control. International logistics is complex. In most cases, you don't pay anything extra. However, if you are in Switzerland or UK you might. It depends if your country is part of EU in may 2017

I read his comments and value his input, I say bring it on! ;) Competition is great for consumers.

I'm not too worried about our product and we also offer 12months warranty to cover manufacturing faults.

My guess is the guy at carvon is feeling the pressure, he is now a direct competitor of Enertion & Raptor 2 - that alone is bad situation, not to mention we have superior technology.
1. FOCBOX
2. Battery size 
3. Current throughput
4. Finally, our motors, are custom designed, with custom magnets, specifically for low rpm torque, critical for hub motors.
5. We also have a patent on hub motor cooling technology, which I'm happy to licence to him when he wants cooler motors.


So my guess is he will continue to try & dis-credit us to gain commercial advantage.

But he is months, maybe a year, away from having a finished product and is probably under huge financial strain... I KNOW BECAUSE I BEEN THROUGH THIS, its tough..

Also, Ask yourself this question about carvon?

1. Why are there no hill climbing videos?
2. Why does he need to put a "protective layer" over his hub motors, is it because they are only 7mm from the ground?

I really like carvon, they are doing awesome stuff with the mechanical engineering. However he needs to move faster and get better electrical engineering or use the FOCBOX (we can offer that too) otherwise he is going to get left behind with an overpriced and outdated esk8....

I agree with you, if you are going to be riding the board these scratches and dents will come eventually anyway so it's not really a problem for most. I can understand though that for some people it might not make it look like a new (professional) product and more like a 2nd hand product. But you should definitely do something with those raptor 2's (@onloop) whether it would be to ship to customers now who don't care about these kind of marks or sell them at a little lower price so you recover some money rather than it being a waste. That's ofcourse if you didn't plan on using them further, maybe you use it for your tours or something I don't know haha

It wouldn't make sense as a business to send less than perfect units to people who say they "don't care about scratches".

Imagine buying an iPhone at retail price and having the screen come pre-cracked. Sure, it would have cracked at some point, but it's just not the experience Apple wants to provide :stuck_out_tongue:. Might be a bit of a contrived example, but you get the point. If he lets this slide, what other gotcha's are there around the corner :)

You're absolutely right Jamy and further shows the quality Jason @onloop is prepared to go hence the long term gain, however there are still many other areas that need improvement and will develop over time. I however am willing to sacrifice this for my video whom I have an established director on board to do and edit. I, like you are also on a time limit which is running out and have many trips through Europe that I could be utilising my drone and board for and can't :frowning: so on this occasion am willing to accept less than perfect for my own gain :slight_smile:

To be honest I already know a few companies that sell "less than perfect" products for a cheaper price because you recover money from it and because there is already enough waste in this world so why create more waste? There's no need to be so upset that your purchase would have these little imperfections that won't affect the products performance at all? You make a comparison with a cracked screen on an iphone which is alot different as it hinders usage. A comparison would be a little scratch on the housing of the iphone lol.

HOWEVER From onloop's point of view I can 100% understand that he only wants to bring out perfection, but I am just talking about the customer's mentality IN GENERAL to expect that perfection is absurd in my opinion

That's a customer service nightmare though.. And especially since you're planning to make videos about the product, I think Jason wouldn't like to see a scratched board in videos that might promote the product.

On the other side, I could say "Oh I'll take that scratched board" and then when it arrives I complain to support that I received a damaged board. Tracking that stuff is a nightmare. In the end it'll cost less time and effort to all parties involved to just send out perfect boards ;)

Yes and no, but you're now delayed and those delays are still ongoing and you talk about customer service (CS), well, their team on Facebook are discriminative of comments irrespective how lame the comments are; CS still have a long way to go imho. With regards to videoing, I'm a drone CAA pilot licensed operator, and the product is centred on something else though through directing and editing we can promote both the drone and other product these imperfections won't be seen hence i'm more keen to get my hands on the product/brand I've invested in sooner rather than later. 

What is happening here is now the emotional side of the business and favouritism, you'l get your board but I won't get mine for what reasons, you're great guy who is positive on the forum but I'm pragmatic and  detailed... blah blah blah ;)

I want my board sooner rather than later, I'm in Italy (Tuscany) Sunday 30th July followed by Germany (Berlin) 6th August then France (Alpe d'Heuez) 21 hairpins turns and am keen to have that aerial shot amongst others  and am willing to share FOC for the community - can you blame me :)

I cannot approve boards for shipping if there are visible issues, sooner or later that sends the wrong message to the production manager and worker's. 

This is an excersice of procedure and processes. It's slow and boring and bad for my customers who are growing impatient... But in the long term it is the only viable option when building a product.

Rejection is a part of the process. I'm fucking pissed right now... This is bullshite. But it's a process.

Without rejected parts, the next thing they will say to me, we didn't think you would care about this crack in the deck or this broken part... how to control it that if we accept other problems.

I cannot allow this, How can I define what scratches are accepted? The only answer is none are accepted...

Will try to ship tomorrow... The cosmetic problems should be fixed by then...

If Jason makes an exception for one guy there will be more to follow who want the same. Just doesn't work that way. 
Besides stridey your board will be mailed this week so I don't see why you trying to push it even more.

All of us who got on board crowdfunding for pre-production knew what we were in for. May was just an overly optimistic shipping forecast. Anyone who ordered expecting this to be met clearly hasn't done their research on how crowdfunding works.  We get the product cheap, due to possible unforeseen delays that may arise in the future. All things considered its only two months delay with the first batch going out this week. Things could have gone allot worst.

Backpacks specifically made for eboards seem to be a niche market, hence they can ask for that excessive price of ¬£109. If you want it attached close to your back seems to be your only option.  Personally I'm just getting a regular skateboard backpack like the [Element Mohave](https://www.titus-shop.com/en_GB/product/880466-Element-Mohave-Backpack-eclipsenavy-ashgrey.html) for example.

There's another post where forum members discussed this topic [Thread link](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carrying-bag-that-isnt-stupidly-overpriced/5306). Not much to go on tho.

I bought both of these bags. The first is padded and will be my storage and transportation (local travel) bag ($30US)
The second is a thinner nylon bag that rolls up reasonably small and will fit inside the normal backpack so I can take it with me (in the normal back pack) when I go places on the board. ($20US)  I have both bags at home and based on measurements they should fit the R2, but do your own check since I don't have a board yet to test it with.

I wouldn't buy a bag like that unless it explicitly said the straps are designed/tested to support a 10kg board. A general skateboard is probably less than a third of the Raptor 2 weight, wouldn't risk the straps falling appart the wrong moment and having Raptor smash to concrete from any height.

To each their own I guess.  If you look at the evolve bag it just comes with a board cover and the stitching is not double or triple threaded either. It looks quite flimsy actually and  is four times the price. I'm not too worried about the Element holding 5kg per strap. You have to consider the weight won't just be resting on those straps there will be some weight distribution.  I know element bags are quality and I can get one for 30 euro, so it's a risk I'm willing to take. 

Besides you will be able to tell if the stitching is coming loose before the board drops as long as you inspect it before each use, if you really that worried about it dropping.  Also if the load is really too much for it to handle it will be noticeable after the first use and I can either return it or use it as a regular stylish backpack since the straps are hideable.

I am sorry not to answer all your individual question about when your board will ship, honestly, checking who is in line for shipment is not my focus just now, I have been invested only in the training of workers & resolution of problems & trying to get assembly lines working efficiently & of course getting Raptor 2 built too.

## GOOD NEWS

**Yesterday we shipped out 8 units, express! Tracking will come next day or so.**

It's very stressful time for me, Everything is on the line here! I believe we got everything perfect! I really hope you like them & can't wait to get some feedback so I know we are doing a good job!. 

ALSO: As of August 1st we will have our customer team permanently working 24/7 on chat & tickets, you can all rest assured that our only focus is to constantly improve our products & service.

I'll be in China again next week to observe the next ramp-up phase of our production line... In just a few weeks, we should be at full speed. Fingers crossed.

To be honest, an extra week would have been very nice... but too much pressure from everyone to ship so I let them go.


**Here are the known issues in first few shipped boards.**

1. The box is not perfect, cardboard is not really stiff enough, so likely to get a bit squashed during transit...extremly unlikely that the product will get damaged so not really concerned (new version delayed again - due  in 1 week)

2. Some very minor imperfections on some hub motor urethane wheels, probably doesn't matter much after the first ride, doesn't impact performance (new parts still one week away)

3. Some slight discolouration/blotches on plastic molded battery lid, not really noticeable unless you look very close, but not 100% perfect either, also not 100% true black color - slight grey which looks good anyway. (mold needs further tuning -  add 1 extra week)

Maybe i am trying to be too much of a perfectionist? I know perfection is not actually achievable....

So in the end, I had to let this stuff slip through final QC... Such minor details & too many people complaining..... Another week delay and people would just lose it.


I am pretty confident everyone will be happy, however, be sure to let me know if your not......

Exactly, minor imperfections on something that will (should) be used intensively really doesn't matter at all. Once you ride it a little bit it will get dirty and get scratches and all that anyway. Also like you said yourself people are getting rather impatient so I don't think they will even notice it has these imperfections when they get their boards lol. And if they really aren't satisfied then you will have your customer service for that. Just know that even when you reach the limit of perfection people can and will still complain regardless. 

Also about the cardboard thing, maybe you should double box it and just add that tape that says "fragile" on it so atleast they are a little more careful with it during transit.

That's the original top 30 list. The order hasn't changed just count from the top to the bottom until you reach 8 and there you go.

No he already wrote quite clearly. To recap only 8 have already shipped with express mail, since those were the only acceptable ones. As soon as more are ready they will be sent on the same day. Judging from his last response it will be another week before any more even get completed, if he is really going to wait for true black color battery lid and better wheels.

Jason is to busy to bother reading forums more than once a week anyway and I don't blame him. If you ask me he should have delegated it long ago to a Enertion  staff member.

[Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWzXSsCHrNo/?taken-by=enertionboards&hl=en) has the data logging from a drag race. Hit a high speed of 54.2 kmph (33.7 mph) and got there in 30 meters (32.8 yards). So psyched to try that sort of speed.

This anticipation is killing me. My other e-board broke down so the raptor 2 is my savior this summer. I find myself checking this forum like 4 times a day hoping he shipped like 50 boards ;).I'm number 21 on the order list so it will probably take another 2 weeks before the board is shipped. @onloop we all know you are doing the best you can to deliver the best product. Take your time. I'll try to keep it together xD

Im totally a hub motor guy but ride quality has never been great so Im very skeptical about the ride quality being better than the boosted board. Hopefully Ill stand corrected after the Raptor 2 Long beach event this coming weekend. I highly doubt it will be as smooth as the @DaviDjembe Carvon V3 board I tested this weekend but Im lookimg forward to seeing what all this "torque talk" feels like. Im guessing it will feel similar to the torque of the 63mm jacobs hubs.

If you want to doubt enertion, do it for their afterservice. Their quality is brilliant. Hope the competition can keep up cause it's good for the industry ( & availability and prices for customers).

Ok, Jason. You handsome piece of fuck!. Im 120% confident you are working super hard and trying your best to get the board out for your customers and make us happy as fast as you can.
As im in the first 8 im politely asking where our tracking numbers are?  I understand you got a lot to do, i really do. But it's been 4 days and im wondering if my board is still in china or stuck in the customs here in Norway, if it is i have to call them and ask them to get my board out of there asap before the snow comes, as stuff like this tend to be stuck in there for up to a month before they let it go and send it to me.

@stridey I might suggest that checking this thread a hundred times a day isn't the best use of your time and energy. Please know, that once your Raptor 2 has shipped, you will receive prompt email confirmation of this, along with a tracking number for you to keep an eye on your shipment.

Additionally, you have not gone to the back of the queue - in fact, we're trying this precise minute (yes, as i'm typing this) to sort out this issue so that you will have your board. I'm not sure how the conclusion was drawn that Enertion's business is managed on emotion rather than pragmatism.

I honestly feel for people who are limited by the elements and the seasons to enjoy their fun toys... that's a real bummer. I just keep thinking, that should have been considered when your preordered something (from a smaller DIY business) that was promised so close to summer time. Stuff like this is always late, often delivered months after promised due dates... we have Evolve and Boosted boards if we want a product immediately. But we don't... we want the best Esk8 has to offer! So we gotta wait :sweat_smile: 

I ordered my raptor 2 within the first minute they went on sale, and honestly, I don't even know where I am in line or when my board will be shipped... and I'm not asking for a cookie or anything... but man, Enertion is working on getting shit sorted. We are all gonna get boards as soon as physically possible. Again... it's a bummer to be counting down the sunny days you have until the next season comes in and rains or snows out the joy rides. I guess my point is, no amount of NOiSE we try to stir up on this forum regarding ship dates is going to be productive. I hope everyone who ordered a Raptor2 gets their boards soon and rides safe ü§ò

Don't know if that was a slight throw of shade towards me or not lmao but I need to know so I can change my shipping address, some of us have school to go to towards the end of summer and thus need to change the previously selected address for a shipment in august and I hope not september instead of may. 

I don't believe my comment sounded like I was impatient, and though it may not be productive to ask of a package arrival, it is not unproductive either as Jason has set aside a customer support team instead of himself single handedly looking at any inquires and delaying working on our boards.

Just something I havent seen talked about yet... The charger.
We all know the "quick charger" is coming with all Raptor2s.
I assume its the same fan cooled 4a quick charger that Enertion has sold for years?

Just some thoughts.. since the raptor is a 4p pack instead of a 3p pack.. and since the batteries are now 30Q instead of 25R....  The pack is now larger and capable of a higher charge rate.

A 4a charger is just 1a per cell (.3C) charge rate. thats below the 1.5 amp (.5C) standard charge of the 30Q cell. The cell is actually rated for a 4a (1.3C) quick charge rate although I would not do it that fast.  Aiming for a solid 1C charge rate, you would need a 12a charger. Well within the safe limits of the cell, below the max limits for battery life, and its just cool to go ride, plug your board in, and have it done in under an hour.

Also, fans kind of suck.
Is there any expected support for a 12a (or higher) fanless charger in the near future?
Also, while I would not expect any warranty support from the use of any non-enertion charger, is there any fuse or limiter on the BMS we should be aware of before someone puts the cell limit of 16a through the charger?

I primarily use the Meanwell HLG series supplies, but I am sure there are cheaper ones around.

A Meanwell HLG-600H-42A will set you back about $170 by the time it gets to your door (in the USA, other countries may differ).. but it will hold out a solid 18A and is fully adjustable down to 7a. As I said, I would adjust it down to about 12a.

If you want something smaller and fanless, the HLG-240H-42A is only $60. It will go to 6A (even though its rated at 5.7) and is only $60.  The only tradeoff is its 9lbs or so.. heavy because its fully potted for vibration and waterproofing.

and finally what you asked for, a HLG-480H-42A will put out 11.5amps, is fanless, waterproof, and is about $130. Since its only $40 more for the 600, I normally go that route, but the 480 is smaller and lighter, so it has its place.

Yeah, I know what I am asking for is not off-the-shelf china stuff... but this isnt an off-the-shelf board.

[/quote]

1st: this is literally a board made in china - you will get a (perfectly fine) off-the-shelf charger because: money
2nd: the PSUs you listed are far from affordable. They set you back more than 10% of the total cost of the raptor - how should enertion justify such a drastic price increase? A 4A charger is like 25$ or less when you buy them in large numbers.

not sure why you want to argue dumb points, but ok...

1. uhh. duh.
2. One of the chargers I listed is far cheaper than[ the fast charger sold by enertionboards.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20161114143017/http://www.enertionboards.com:80/electric-skateboard-parts/Space-cell-battery-fast-charger/) for years. Its also fanless, waterproof etc...  and I never said to sell it with the board.

Both those points are moot. I am not asking him to sell meanwells. I am not asking him to sell a charger with the board. I just pointed out that there is a large room for improvement in the charger, a part that has not been updated like everything else, and that a fast charger might be something worth looking into in the future.
YOU were the one that was unaware of fanless power supplies in the 500w range. I was just being nice enough to share the ones I have experience with. I have actively used meanwells to charge my ebikes and goped for years now. 500w is tiny to me, but huge to e-skateboards.  Its only with the larger size battery that the raptor has that even makes me bring it up.

This thread is full of people that tossed in $1200 on a product that didnt exist at the time, and some of them threw in another $60 just because they wanted a larger battery... I am sure some of them wouldnt mind paying $100 for a faster charger, or a silent one.
My personal reason for it is work. I am in a silent office, and I plan to keep one charger at home, one at work. At work I would prefer no fan. For me its no big deal, I already have my meanwells... although if he comes up with something in the $130 or less range around 500w, I would probably buy it.

Not arguing with anyone here, but I'd like to point out that it probably isn't in Enertion's best interest to promote using a fast (beyond 4A) charger given that slower charging is better for cell life, especially for 18650's. Companies like One Wheel can offer decently fast chargers (for quite a lot of $$) since they use a chemistry that allows for (up to 4C for lifepo4).

I was perfectly aware of the ones you posted - I said affordable (as in: in the range of the 4A fast chargers or slightly more), and these are not.
Also they are not Liion chargers per se but general purpose PSUs - slight deviations when setting the charge current could cause enormous problems. You'd probably be better of with a digitally controlled boost converter.
You are the one with the (please forgive me) stupid idea to use an even larger charge current than the 4A currently used. Most people on here are noobs (especially the ones buying ready-made boards) that would probably burn their house down by attempting such an "upgrade".

Also I don't understand why money is apparently a dumb point, when it is THE reason why nobody is offering a larger charger. There is just no money to be made and you can apparently just get them on your own when needed as you just described.

Enertion is never going to address a niche product like that when there is no money to be made. You obviously know that so frankly I don't get what your initial post was about.

I dont want to argue with anyone either.
I kinda agree with you. While charging slower to a point extends battery life, at this point 4a is so slow that its below the "standard charge" of the 30Q. You can check this on the spec sheet.
At this point, its charging so slow that its not extending cell life, its just taking longer. These cells were developed for power tools, and they're pretty robust for charging.
If you really wanted to extend cell life, instead of charging them to 4.2v, you would stop at 4.15 or so. that has a much larger effect with no changes to user behavior. 
To take it one step further, you could keep the board at 80% or so, then charge it to the 4.15 only right before you go.

all that would maximize cell life. Given that hes taking the cells to 4.2 anyway, its kind of moot. it will get what it gets.

my point was that the charger can be faster now, with no side effects on cell life, or much faster with a small effect on it, or much much faster with a larger effect on it. thats all.

the whole thing from the other guy is just someone being argumentative. He would rather yell that it cant be done than contribute.

If you want to contribute, then do it where it actually matters like here:

Posting this in the Raptor 2 thread makes no sense to me.

Mr Dude asked a question that you didn‚Äôt like and you suddenly decided to be extremely condescending while telling him how pointless his question is. Whether he is right or wrong his original question picked the interest of a few people including me. So if someone isn‚Äôt contributing to the discussion that‚Äôs you. 

It‚Äôs crazy the number of people that get tense and frustrated in this thread. Can‚Äôt we all just get along? Can you respect the fact that someone has a different opinion on a battery adapter, or on shipping dates, without taking it personally? I‚Äôd be great if that was the case so that we can get actual constructive arguments being made while respecting everyone‚Äôs opinion, because i‚Äôve seen better attitude in a high school breakroom.

I did not read the whole argumentation, but its a 42V 4A fanless charger, it takes 2hrs from dead to 100%.

I've only owned 2A chargers in yhe past, i really like this one.

You also don't seem to understand that I am actually trying to help you guys. Nobody will care at enertion - the reasons have been stated and are fairly obvious. The idea is good and I am all for it. @MrDude_1 seems to know his way around PSUs so he should make a thread where this knowledge can actually benefit people. As you can see with the topics that I linked people have already been talking about similar stuff. If we have these random talks about PSUs in topics like this nobody will ever be able to find that information. How is a guy supposed to find the info on which meanwell fanless PSUs are out there? He will certainly not be looking in the raptor 2 thread.

I actually like my cheaper China version than the meanwell I had for reasons but, wanted to get in saying the same as here and in my experience u can charge many amps and still be fine for cells and it's the costs of the high current chargers and associated bms I think is why it's not available.   I do 500 watt charging at 10 amps and bet you can do many more with minimal cell effects. It's a huge plus. 

I have a fan on my latest which is kinda annoying. I have a huge heat sink I'd like to hook to it and mount it to the wall with long wires.  Fuck u could do 1000 watt charging I bet no problem maybe I'm guessing 1500 before in my mind the trade off wouldn't be good for me.  But don't take my guess and look at the charts and that could blow up

I really don't expect Enertion to have such expensive/advanced/high capacity chargers on any of their boards, I wouldn't even ask if it might be supported in the future, it's not realistic at all.

It's like asking: Why didn't Enertion upgrade to high precision forged trucks on the Raptor 2?, that's kind a innocent question that @Maxid is trying to explain with a technical/commercial suitable response.

The OEM charger is perfectly fine I'm really glad they decided to ship a 4A charger as an upgrade, I wouldn't ask for more

Just to clarify this, the trucks both front and back are CNC'ed from an aluminium billet (hanger and base). They are not an off the shelf component
