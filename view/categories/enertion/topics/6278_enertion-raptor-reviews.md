HERE IS MY REVIEW, FEEL FREE TO POST YOURS.

Hey all, I've had a raptor for a few days and I wanted to post a few first impressions after a couple of days of riding.  Many of you may have seen me posting here, but for those who haven't I have had (or tried out) quite a few E-boards.  I'm was an avid skater prior to E-boarding.  About 3 years ago I started doing downhill but transitioned to E-boards.  I've had boards such as the boosted dual plus, yuneec E-go, a custom LHB build, and now this raptor.  Future plans faster and faster builds :)

I'll keep my comments short and break them into a few categories, these will be updated over time:

**Warranty/Customer support:**
I cannot comment much on this.  I don't want to jinx anything, but the raptor has been solid so far.  If there are every any issues I'll update this with how good the customer support is.  I will say Jason from Enertion has been responding on the forums, and Enertion Support usually gets back to your emails but they take a long time and often times they just miss seeing your email.  

UPDATE: many customers continue reporting very slow response times, so keep this in mind.  Read this whole thread.  

**Delivery time** 
It took slightly over 3 months from my order date, but that's fine.  I understood the challenges Enertion was having getting VESCs.  I'm sure in the future their stock will be much better and their shipping times will be way faster.  

**Quality control/Packaging**
All the nuts and bolts were done well.  The wheels were tightened perfectly, usually they're either too loose or too tight.  I was missing 2 screws for the lid, which didn't effect anything but still they should be more careful about things like that.  Instruction manual for board was sufficient, but instruction manual for remote would be helpful.  I already knew how to use it though.  Packaging could be better, just simple bubble wrap in a cardboard box.  I guess I shouldn't expect apple like packaging.  

**Aesthetics/handling**
This is usually a personal preference, I always love black and red.  But I was very impressed with the raptor.  It looks better in person than the photos.  The carbon fiber deck design is awesome.  The integrated enclosure for the battery gives it a super clean look.  I'm glad it has a kick tail, they're beneficial in my opinion.  Weight is pretty acceptable, it feels the same to me as the boosted dual plus.  The handle is a nice touch.  I'm not sure if the bottom of the board will stay this pretty, I believe the motor mounts will start to get scratches and scrapes pretty soon from rocks etc.  I would recommend riding over smooth roads without a lot of rocks/debris.  

**Performance**
This is where the raptor shines.  Torque and acceleration are unmatched by ANY other board I've used.  I don't have too many steep hills where I am, but I tried going up a few moderate grade hills and the raptor destroyed those hills.  I'm about 64 kg and I hit a top speed of 27 mph on flats, and have hit a max of 30 mph on a slight decline.  See my test in the video at bottom of this post.   The top speed will satisfy most, be too much for some, and 1% of the market may want more (because they have hit higher speeds while doing DH before like me...or because they are crazy risk takers).  The brakes are strong.  Also note that there is NO reverse, which I'm 100% okay with because you don't ever need reverse.

**Throttle response**
VESC settings are great.  It has the killer acceleration I was looking for, yet you can still go slow if you want to (see my video).  It's not as smooth as something like the boosted board's remote though, that's the one thing boosted has going for them.

**Battery life/Range**
Battery lasts way longer than a boosted board would AND it's easier to swap than the boosted battery will be in their V2.  It doesn't have a ridiculously long range, but it is sufficient for almost everything.  All I can say is the range is enough and I'm 100% satisfied with it.   I'll update this section with real world figures soon enough.  

UPDATE: I did a slow speed/cruising range test, I kept it under speeds of 20 mph for the most part to mimic my boosted board.  I kick pushed to start each time and coasted as much as possible.  I accelerated gently each time to try to extend the range as much as possible.  I'm 63.5 kg (140 lbs), weather was 88 F or 31 Celsius.  I got 17 miles (23.5 km) of range WITH 11% battery left over.  My average speed was 12 mph and like I said I was testing to extend range as much as possible.  I have no doubts that in ideal conditions I can get 20 miles of range while riding very conservatively.  

**Reliability**
To be determined.  I know other people have issues that Jason from enertion has been resolving. 

**Other things I liked so far**
I can almost use it as a normal longboard, there is not a lot of resistance from the drivetrain.  I show this in one of my video tests.  The range of the remote is pretty good, all that someone would need.  The raptor also ships with this protective guard around the nose and the tail, I'm going to keep those on as long as possible.  I like to stand the board on it's tail and I'm glad that guard is there rather than the nice carbon fiber.  I like being able to see the charge on the board just by looking down.  

**Things I didn't like**
I have no idea why this happened (maybe a loose wire connection to the VESC?) and I cannot replicate it, but one of the motors randomly just went out.  The board felt sluggish and slow.  This was resolved by turning the board on/off.  It has not happened again (and hopefully never does).  One of the holes in the board for the lid was stripped so you cannot put a screw there, but it didn't really effect anything since there are so many other screws holding the lid in place.  Dust gets inside the enclosure through the openings in the lid so I clean it often.  The cruise control is a gimmick, doesn't work well.  The stock wheels are too hard, HIGHLY recommend upgrading to abec 11 flywheels...83 mm 75a durometer.

**Overall thoughts**
I'm extremely happy with this board as long as keeps working!  I think @onloop  from Enertion has created a very efficient drivetrain.  The dual motor drivetrain, the gear ratios, the battery, the VESCS, the trucks, the wheels all work well together to give the rider an awesome experience.  I could describe it as beautifully simple, because it really is.  You can easily see how it's all put together just by lifting the lid to look at the electronics and by looking at the motors mounts carefully.  

Here are some of my videos and tests.  Subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos and comparisons with other boards (like the boosted dual plus).

Thanks for this Thread, I think we really need a seperate one!
Mine just arrived (though the remote is still on the was).
100000+ for the great look. It looks so much better live than in pictures. Pure awesomeness!

I rode it on every rough surface i could find for the last 2 weeks, it held up very well.
Only two small scratchesa in the aluminum on the motor mount.
Nothing on the CF surface, even if there were a lot of rocks fliying into it.

I changed the Flywheel clones to proper flywheels, that made the ride way smoother.

Please can you elaborate a little further on the mod you've made. I also have a Raptor Duel en route (#4808) and I'm very curious about this flywheel thing you've done? Seems rather odd these would come with a part not up to par...

The Enertion flywheels are harder (Around 85-87A i think).

I got ABEC11 Flywheels with 75A.

As they are softer, they dampen rough surface much better and roll smoother. Less vibration means less stress on the components and on your feet.

I thought the enertion clones were 80a, but yes good call on getting 75a flywheels.  I always like a softer durometer better for more grip, and smoother ride.

He is talking about the wheels.  The wheels that come with are okay, but he upgraded to softer wheels.  Softer wheels are better to make ride more comfortable since they absorb more vibrations.  They also have better grip.  It's easy to upgrade wheels, get same size ABEC flywheels.  You will have to open up the drivetrain though and put the wheel pulley in the new flywheel.  

I only ride on smooth surfaces, so the stock wheels are fine for me.  But if you have roads that are rough, softer wheels are better.

Yes, on paper they are 80a, but they feel much harder than that (as most clones do). And i beat them really hard. The harder wheels get scratches really fast.

Ah thank you bro, for a moment there I was imagining a tiny little weighted disk thing spinning around, kinda like a flywheel on an old combustion engine, but this makes way more sense :) and far easier to install if need be. Guess I'll try the stock wheels and see how I get on, but it's great to know this is an option. I'll be using this Raptor Duel as my daily commuter around Brighton (UK) where its super hilly and the roads/sidewalks are either pavement slabs or tarmac, neither of which are particularity "smooth"..

Same shape as Enertion wheels. I have the old style aluminum pulley, so they need to be drilled out a bit. New pulley should snap right in.

Almost, the same size but they have it in 75a which is even softer for absorbing more vibration and bumps.  The one you posted is 78a so slightly harder.  The blue one on raptor is 80a.  

http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/371656736265?lpid=82&chn=ps&ul_noapp=true

If you have good and smooth roads the stock wheels are good.  Only if you have rough roads or bumps then the abec 11 83mm wheels with 75a durometer makes ride more comfortable and grip better.

Cheers bro, totally would have ordered these incorrect 78a ones lol. I think this would be a nice option for Enertion (@onloop) to offer Raptor buyers during check-out at some later stage; Which density/hardness wheel they prefer depending on local road surfaces. Will buy these if/when I feel the stock wheels are overly hard. Although don't imagine that'll be for at least 5 - 6 weeks as I'm #4808 which isn't even listed on that order timetable thingy yet. Tho doing a date:order calculation I can extrapolate the approximate delivery window if Raptor production progresses at the same rate. I wanna send the team an espresso machine or something :)

I somehow cannot manage to stuff it inside without being on top of something or I just suck lol
Can you give me a hint
Edit: im just concerned about bending the cables lol, lemme do some bending and see if it works.
How much can I bend the xt60 cable coming from the raptor?

@onloop & @EnertionSupport ^ This seems like a simple fix no(?), and a complaint I've seen mentioned more than once now. Please add an extra inch or two of cable if possible on future orders. (Esp. Raptor Duel #4808)

This is not an issue at all... I'm not even sure why it's posted.  No need to tag onloop or enertion support.   It's just a matter of  plugging the cable in.  A child can do it.   

Adding more cable would just make things harder.

This "issue" has been mentioned a few times now by different Raptor customers. Surely if numerous clients are all worried about damaging this cable that appears too short and needs to be bent at an uncomfortable degree, it's something very easily rectified by simply cutting it an inch or two longer when making it. 

How would an extra inch of cable make things harder? There's ample room for an extra inch of cable in that space..

Ideally I don't want to have to be careful bending any cable in fear of breaking it when it could easily be made very slightly longer.

Even with long cable though, you will have to bend it.  A gentle bend won't do anything to cable.  Watch the video by enertion, they also bend the cable when installing.

THIS IS THE MOST FUN YOU CAN IMAGINE! 
It is just a beast. The first time I stepped on it it flew away under me and I fell. I just barely moved the stick.
After that I started carefully and didnt fall since then.
It is just a MONSTER!
The braking is something to get used to and practice a lot but works really really well (be careful the motor brakes the board well :-) )
The fastest I drove was about 25-30 kmh i imagine and that was really fast! The speed wobbles were too big since I didnt know how hard the trucks are set after shipment. Ill harden em now.
This is just an awesome feeling, flying by people. Sooo many turning heads and I had some conversations already!! 
Sadly here in Berlin, Ger its not legal yet.
I will do my next tour in 5 mins - have fun everyone :smile:

Nice, ride some more and then share your thoughts.  You will get used to wobbles, if you're a new skateboard your stabilizer muscles will develop and you will balance better.  

Don't over tighten trucks!  Adjust them for your weight, the heavier you are the tighter you need them to be.  Mine just need about half a turn from factory to be tightened to how I want them.  The looser trucks allow for better carving and turning also.

A clicking/popping sound is likely too tight.  A lot of new people over tighten them because they think it will avoid speed wobbles.  Wobbling you will learn to balance with experience, tightening a little is fine but over doing it can make it even more dangerous

Update after the third ride in slide wet streets with nasty nature sticking everwhere on my raptor now.
I get a better feel for driving it by now and it feels real good! 
Still want to buy some proper gear and a camera.
Im currently wearing my motorcycle helmet and gloves. They work perfectly fine on the controller, the same speed is easily holdable. I dont know why anyone would want a speed control as I felt like it was second nature to stay one speed if wanted.
It is soo much fun! 
I rode about 15 km and it said 70%ish percent on the lid.

Battery factory worker who made my space cell put the power button a little too close to the side of the lid (there was literally no clearance between the lid and the button). Went on my first ride and 20 minute later the CF glass lid cut into the power button and the whole thing just shuts down. Had to call uber cause I was pretty far from my fiancee place. 

@onloop was pretty fast in responding to my inquiries and immediately tried to resolve the problem, but its either I fix it myself or wait 2 weeks to get it fix or wait for the battery factory to resupply and make me a new one. Listen man, I got butter fingers, I don't trust myself with tools and I'm gonna fudge the operation one way or the other and it'll take longer than 2 weeks to solve it. SO, I thought of a genius idea to overnight ship it to @longhairedboy to get it fix and i'll be back in business by Monday (obviously on my dime).....welp, USPS decided today was a good day to fuk with me because I was already having a bad day and decided the tracking info did not need to show up in their system. Now i'm not even sure if it'll reach Damon in time for Saturday shipping.

I understand this is entirely out of the control of everyone involved (except for that battery factory worker.....If only i can give him a piece of my mind :triumph:) But I do have to wonder whether that being up there is trying to send me a message or something, cause throwing money at the problem produce no desirable results and my BB D+ is out of commission too! ahhhh fuk it, i'm going to grab a beer and just stay home and watch the news or something.

wow, how did the CF lid cut into the power button?? Cuz the lid is secure in place and even if the button is touching the side it shouldn't do anything?

Mine is also touching one side but no issues yet.  meaning the CF lid is brushing one side of the button.

Not a huge issue tbh. Just put a piece of small foam on the side just in case and you should be in business. I think best case scenario is to cut a small piece of the lid off touching the button.

There have been a few space cell manufacturing faults surface on here lately. Impossible to tell if it's a high number in comparison to the overall number. I wonder what the failure/ return rate is for enertion, and if it is still below onloop's expectation/ contract with the manufacturer? Also, in this case, I wonder if the raptor lid design is an issue, because the tolerance for the space cell build might exceed the perfect alignment the raptor lid needs to align the switch and display ports?

If memories serve me right, I was going over a small pot hole.....its not even a pot hole, only an inch indentation on the road. Went right over it and the vibration from the lid probably just cut into the power button and broke it.. The button is still there and the battery still works, but the stupid button just would not turn on. Almost threw the whole battery onto the middle of oncoming traffic.

Well you only hear about the failures I would imagine, I wouldn't say anything if I have a working space cells cause i'll be out and about enjoying my life on a esk8, BUT I CANT! Fudgeeeee i'm so aggravated right now :triumph:

I don't think the is a design problem, its the factory problem. They have the deck and the lid so they should have tested  out all the batteries but they didn't so its a failure on their part. They're lucky they don't work for my firm, i would have ask for them to pay for all the costs of rectifying the problems and reconsider another factory if they don't, but @onloop seems too lenient on them. Whatever the case may be, we don't know whats going on behind the scene so i'll leave it to him. My bad luck, I hope it runs out soon.

Had the same issue with the space cell button on my raptor. Battery slides sideways a bit and weight of the battery and thin edge of lid combine to snap one side of the rocker switch. It's actually a very easy fix. Simply cut top portion of heat shrink to gain access, pop out old switch, solder in new switch (two wires), tape space cell up, go ride.

Do you experience that one motor rotates more as the other too? When I turn the board on the back and let the throttle go a bit and stop, one motor rotates longer than the other. Is that normal? Just wondering

I've been a d+ while I wait for my GT to arrive. It gets back on Tuesday :) I also got one of the newer decks that has 2 more screws on the lid near the middle. 

@HoboFarts got his board back the other day :p 

But yeah it is kinda shitty. the timing was smooth though. I really missed commuting to work with boosted despite the lack of power so buying it used turned out to be a good decision. @HoboFarts was going on a long vacation so it wasn't much of an inconvenience having to send it back seeing as he wouldn't have brought it with him.

UPDATE: I did a slow speed/cruising range test, I kept it under speeds of 20 mph for the most part to mimic my boosted board.  I kick pushed to start each time and coasted as much as possible.  I accelerated gently each time to try to extend the range as much as possible.  I'm 63.5 kg (140 lbs), weather was 88 F (31 C).  I got 17 miles (23.5 km) of range WITH 11% battery left over.  My average speed was 12 mph and peak was 27 mph.  Like I said I was testing to extend range as much as possible, so I was mostly under 20 mph.  I have no doubts that in ideal conditions I can get 20 miles of range while riding very conservatively.

Next test will be range while I'm shredding and going as hard as I can, I suspect it will drop significantly but it will still be more than double what my boosted dual plus got me for sure.

Jonloop  advised that you need to actually have higher speeds and constant fo get the range. I think there are a number of factors that you already mention, but you should also try that, but you would need a cycle/track rink like onloop has used. Or a straight stretch of 30km,  in real world situations as that slow range test. 

I think 25km is about what I was getting, but I have managed to get to 30km. Also that 11% you have left on the battery goes a long way when using regenerative braking. Far more extra distance you may think. However you dont want to be too hard or you may get stranded from home trying to stretch it till it dies. Ive tried doing circles around fhe block just fo push it to the limit.

At the end of the day 25km is frign awesome, I have an extra space cell, so its actually my body that cant last. 25km worh say a few stops etc. Thats a 1.25 to 1.30hr ride. Maybe even 1.45. Not going to get that on the boosted yet.

I feel like 25km under normal riding conditions is great. Any more is a bonus that probably rarely gets used day to day. I thought I'd be using the Eco mode on the GT for extra long range occasionally- I don't. Because it limits the torque and speed and I'd rather reduce my range than reduce the ride performance. I also find that my feet are far more stationary than almost any other mode of transport- once I exceed 25km in a single session my feet start to feel it, and will sometimes cramp. Not sure if additional range beyond 25km is worth the weight premium (more batteries) or performance hit. I guess it depends if you have a longer commute, but then I'd probably reach for some other mode of transport.

If youre on your own and up for a big day out the extra range is helpful.  Ive used my spare battery. But alternatively if you have a fast charger I can charge mine to almost full on a lunchbreak with the fast charger and a powerpoint.

But 25km is reasonable distance to any work or destination where you might normaly have driven.

Update here: I started riding again yesterday, it gets better and better!
I gave the Raptor to my 10 yrs older brother which managed to push his limits and fell off while doing a manual... The carbon fiber on the rear and got rashes of quite a bit because the protection got dragged of... 
Hurts to see it having cosmetic damage already but only a bit that can be hidden under the protection at the end.

@michichopf Whats  your weight and how many hills are you doing. Its probably more an issue of how steep your hills are and how long they are. The dam thing is unbelievable up hills, buf I cant say Ive done alot of hilas constantly. Thats not to say the thing cant handle it. My rides are a mixtiure of more flat  paths then steep inclines. Look at Enertions earlier vids with 10kg back and hes 95kg, Dont specualte just wait and see and you should be pleasantly surprised.

If you have momentum already between down and up I assume it should be fine. Just dont load up on mid hill, just pust more pressue on the motor I would have thought. Also dual would be fhe way to go wifh extra needed torque ans braking.

Touch the motors to see if they get too hot.

I might try to post videos of me doing tricks on the raptor, I'm just scared cuz it's a $1700 skateboard lol... Don't want to screw anything up.  On second though I won't do that.  I know I saw Jason doing it but I only have one raptor that I don't want to screw up from impact.  I think I can slide this board but it's pretty difficult because the wheels are not really optimum for sliding, they are big and grippy.  Sliding my normal longboard is sooo much easier.  Honestly I think I would NOT do slides or tricks... Unless someone wants to donate me a raptor for me to do tricks on, I'd be happy to do those and post videos.  But I don't want to on my own raptor lol.

My board is defective too.. first when it arrived the wheels were spinning in opposite directions.. On top of that, one of the wheels only worked intermittently. Took it to a Drone repair shop and they were able to fix the wiring as the wires were put in backwards (or mixed up). So finally the wheels were both spinning in the correct direction.. but i still have the problem of the one motor not running..  the scary part is that it will kick in while riding and gives a boost like turbo and can easily throw you off..

@Socal and @jux, just msg @onloop directly with the subject with many asterisks, eg: *********Raptor motor problem********. That'll gain his attention. I think for Raptors problems he'll be able to provide tips and help out. I had a battery problem and he went the extra mile to help me out. Though technically it isn't anyone's fault,  he was able to accommodate. Give him about 48 hours to respond.

If you open it up and look at the VESCs, I bet it's a loose canbus cable. Look at the cable connecting both VESCs and make sure it isn't lose at all. If it is, that's your problem and if it works once you plug it in, try hot gluing it or something once you've got it working well so it doesn't happen again.

You could have wires touching inside the motor that's stuttering. Look inside the motor where the wires are entering the motor and see if you notice any blackish burn marks or the bronze color scraped off the wires.

Alright boys, I'm back in the game. Got my battery back and fixed. Went for a ride for almost an hour annnnnnnnnnnnnd I had a wipeout. Thank the lord for my protective gears cause it probably would have been worst. I have a suspicion it could be that I need to tighten the belt tension. Anybody know how to do that?

Also, after eating the road, I can safely say that G-form knee pads is not worth it if you're going to have an accident. Seriously invest in something more stronger.

I think one thing everyone should keep in mind is that at its heart the raptor is still a DIY board.  If you don't like DIY you may have to sacrifice performance/range and go with something like the boosted where they reply to emails quickly and will have you ship them the board even to fix minor issues.

"Suspicious," not sure yet, gotta ride a bit more to make sure. When I ride at top speed and applied breaks, the belt started skipping (clicking noise); that usually indicates the belt is not tight enough. So this wipeout I had earlier was because I was topping out at max speed then without realizing I was at the end of the block, I applied the break and the belt started skipping and the Raptor rear started wobbling. 1/2 second later I fell forward and did the greatest barrel roll of my life (I'm actually kinda proud of that one). 

In my mind, its either the belt tension or the wheels themselves. I trust your wheels, but the belt is one thing that can get loosen. So after checking it kinda feels like one belt is a bit more loose than the other but both feel loose regardless.

@onloop @Photorph

Btw, I have the fast charger and was wondering if double red light means its fully charge?

Double green means fully charged. It'll keep charging even thought the battery reads 100%. Fall sounds like a combination of things (most of mine have been). I'd tighten the belt a bit...maybe put higher Duro bushings in rear...but also it sounds like you just need to get used to riding the raptor again...these things are the Lamborghini's of esk8s.

Thank dude, I was wondering why it went to 100% so fast. 

And about the combination of things, I agree. I think I'm going to buy different sets of wheels for more grip and just change out the bushings like you recommended. Any suggestions? 

Also, yes, this beast is really powerful. I'm never able to push the throttle to full speed for more than 3-5 seconds, the layout of the city just doesn't allow it. :sweat_smile:

Hey.
So i di my first 180km on my Raptor (holidays jej ;)) 
So far everything holds up fine. Had to adjust belt alignement once and tension After mayby 80km. Only thing i would wish for is different speed settings and a different controller.( mine is about to break, the "a" button to connect and turn on is jammed and is very sensitiv to touch wich isn't that great). So i will find out how and if i can upgrade to a different remote.

2 Questions came up though.

1.) Today was really hot 35*celcius and i did a nice journey to visit my grandmother 18km. The motors were fairly warm but the battery fot really hot so you could feel the heat through the deck. Is there a temperature thats too hot so i can messure it the next time and check it? 

2.) how is the situation by law in your cointry is it allowed, tollerated or in a grey area?

Holy crap guys, I just smoke my friend on her Ducatti with the Raptor in the city. She was shock at how fast this beast is on the road. This thing is no joke. I didnt even reach top speed at all. I'm gonna wait until I get the full face helmet and hard shell pads before trying it top speed again. Such an adrenaline feeling, so glad I got this board.

I was wearing very light shoose and could feel it through the lid. It was considerably warmer than the motors. Close to being uncomfortable to be touched by hand. Btw: when the battery came it didn't work i had to connect the charge board to the circuit.

Whenever she passed me in a straightaway, I was able to make it up when the light turns red or there is a traffic jam. She was surprised how fast the Raptor was at throwing in the torque and catching up, she just wasn't able shake me off.

Better safe than sorry, try and see if it gets that hot going on slow speed. And on which side of the board it gets hot. For me, it gets hot toward the rear probably due to the vesc.

Day 4 of riding the Raptor. Took it out next to the "Spree" here in Berlin where it was sooo enjoyable to ride and there is no police around usually.
So slowly Im getting a feel for the Raptor. It becomes more and more fun the more you can trust yourself with it and it is possible to "curve" a bit but it definetely has its own charm when speeding up huge inclines and driving smooth roads fast while looking and feeling like flying. 
It is like a rush or perfect feel as if you were driving a sportscar on a track, real good fun. Im always wearing my motorcycle helmet and get some weird looks but I love it. Fits perfectly to the board when ridden hard. It is still scary to know that there is nothing to save you but your own stabilization on the board but thats just the way it is on an eskate. 
I did not yet reach full speed but have ridden 30kmh + -  some time when having free space.
It is just addicting. I wish it was legal or even something to look up to here in germany. A fun and "eco" transportation tool.

I know what you mean dude. The fun is amplified when you speed pass cars and bike! Be careful when you eventually go top speed. Make sure you're suited up from head to toe in armor, falling on asphalt sucks, but it worst when there are cars around. 

In regard to the law thing, is it possible to register the board with the german department of transportation? My friend makes gas power bicycle, which is basically a motorcycle, and he was able to register it with the department of transportation and ride it legally. My board is also illegal in NYC too but NYPD usually don't bat an eye when they see me or other eskater.

So about that, 2 quick questions: When I ride the Raptor I can hear the wires inside moving, I'm sure its ok, but is it a good idea to tape it down just to be safe? Also, when you said hard stop, do you mean quick hard break or just slow breaking? Cause I usually engage break for 2 sec then let go and reengage again after another second. It just feels right to do a slow stop. It never dawn on me that it takes a toll on the motor when I'm breaking (makes sense). Thanks for the info btw!


Edit: dudeee, thanks for telling me to check, found this while doing maintenance:

For all the ppl sitting on the fence as to whether they should commit to a Raptor, just get an order in and be patient. The thing is awesome.

 Once you have one you will wonder how you lived without it. When Ive finished a ride Im thinking about the next adventure on it.  Sure there could be issues. Its like any mechanical and electronic piece of transport, it needs maintenance and the thing takes a pounding. 

Most of all take care at speed. This no helmet stuff with BB riders is not cool. The Raptor goes at 27miles per hour and demands respect. If your going at those speeds up a hill theres nothing like it being able to stand there as you pass everything.

Enjoy All my fellow Raptor Owners we are truely in a club of our own. Also post in my where are all the Raptors in the world.p thread. Come on Aussies where are you.

Even though the raptor  goes a tad bit faster and probably has more torque than my GT I'm still a bit hesitant to place another order.. I'm eager to see how all of your boards hold up and what (hopefully little, if any) issues you guys run into. Think I'll jump in when the Raptors are not on pre order status and parts are in good supply. Being out of commission sucks..also want to see what people think of the new remote

I can pretty much guarantee that you will have to tinker with the raptor more than you would with the GT.  It's a board made out of DIY components.  But If you just open the lid and look at it... Its all so simple.  Just a receiver, VESCs, which go out to motors that are attached to the trucks by the motor mounts.  

As you can see from this thread, issues do arise but most of them are issues you can fix yourself.  For example if you look at my original review I wrote that one of my motors randomly went out while riding.  This was likely because one of the motor wires wasn't plugged in all the way so I had to push it into the VESC.  Simple as that, issue didn't happen again.  

There are also higher chances of something being built incorrectly at the factory, for example the battery on/off switch not being in the perfect position that many people have complained about.  Instead of demanding a new battery, I would have just cut the lid opening a bit wider.  Other complaints with more complicated DIY solutions are things like the phase wires getting shorted out.  

So point being, you will find complains about issues.  But MOST of those the user can resolve themselves.  I don't think this board is for the average Joe who just wants to buy a board and then send it back to the company for any minor issue that arises, get a boosted if you want that.  You will have to learn the electronics and mechanics, you will need to check that all screws are done properly, you will need to check belt alignment and tension and know how to adjust both, you will need to understand how the whole drivetrain works, and how the electronics are laid out and what they do.  If you know all that, this and the LHB custom boards are in fact the best performing boards on the market by far.  That's just a fact, if someone wants to find me higher performance boards than my LHB or the raptor... Let me know cuz I couldn't find any.

Edit: I haven't had to learn the VESC tuning yet because the raptor settings are PERFECT.  Dare I say it's as controllable as the boosted almost, maybe with a better remote it might be even better.  Also if someone wants me to make a video of how the electronics are laid out in the raptor and what each component is and how it hooks into what... I can.  But I think enertion already did that on their youtube channel somewhere.

I will make a lenghty comparison after 350km. Mainly to the boosted and my diy build of wich i both rode more on. Daily commute of 10km per way adds up quick ;)

Edit: i also want to change the remote because i dont like it, it broke already and it is too small for my big hands ( I am 2,04 m). Probably will see what most poeple would like to change to, do it and do a tutorial for those who might be frightened to do themselves.

I have not had any startup issues yet  I'm not sure which caps I have, because I didn't open the heat shrink tubing yet.  My VESCs are wrapped fully in the black shrink tubing as you can see in this video I made earlier.

Next time I have my lid open I can check though.

Edit: in the video you can actually see it is one of the big 3300uF capacitor.  Thanks @magnetvox for spotting that and correcting me.

Quick idea remark. It hit 220 km on my Raptor now, so I checked every screw, took care of the bearings etc. Then i took the Lid of and saw that a lot of dust was inside. The 2 cutouts (plug/switch and bms screen) allow dirt to get into the board-enclosure. So my Idea is using some special ruber band with adhesive to put around the oppening from the inside to close it off nicely. Its 0.8mm thick and very soft. Sounds like a good idea?!  Or am I doing a mistake?

Yep that is exactly what i was afraid off. Poeple will compare the customer service and effort they may need to put into the raptor with other luxury buys they made. 
I am way worse than many guys on here when it comes to Vescs and electronics, so I am not even going to pretend how to fix it. But if somone took care of their Vesc and secured them somehow additionally mayby upload a picture/Video. Because to be honest i didnt check mine (hard to see anything shrink tube and position so cramed i cannot se much) so that doenst happen to me. Got way more distance out of it already though

So i have hit around 255km on my Raptor and first issues showed themselves today.
1.) acceleration sometimes cuts out, meaning uphill or straight i cannot go faster it just keeps the speed even though you press the throttel on the remote. Then a few seconds somehow you get hit with the full throttel. Scary shit sometimes.
Any ideas what the cause may be ? And how to fix it ? (happened about 5 times in the 20 min i rode)

2.) Somehow the raptor is much more noisy all of the sudden, also a different sound got added to the mix, sort of click clack but in rapid sucsession. I checked the alignment, the belts, the tension etc. All that i can see seems to be fine (though im hardly an expert). Tipps, ideas suggestions ?

I somehow got a bad feeling, like I will die on me. Im rode it back home like it was made out of glass. :slight_smile:

Difference in sound is usually a good trigger to get everything checked before it gets to a point where something gets unfix-able broken.
Check if your circlips on your rotor are still in the right positions (try moving the motor bell)
Check if both motors can spin equally by hand and with full throttle. When you leave the controller in neutral they should come to an almost even stop.
Check the 4 bolts of the motor in the carbon fibre mount haven't loosened.
Check the bolt on your pulleys

If you have this occurring again, don't shut down the battery and hook it up to the BLDC tool. Go to the terminal part and type fault. See if the VESC reports errors

Thank you for your Input.

I did all the points above and all is O.K.
The only thing is the following. How much wiggel or room to move should the pulley have outwards and rotational. So if i pull on the motor pulley it comes a little tiniy bit to the outside so you can hear it wiggle if you push and pull. Same if i hold the mottor and try to rotate the pulley. Again movement, tiny bit.

It should be very very minimal.(read the pulley should move together with the rotor.) Can you tighten the pulley screw so it doesn't move solo?

At high rpm this could cause your clicking sound...

ABECs are great if you don't mind the green :P I use them on my GT and they've been lovely. I know @onloop expressed concern over this batch of wheels and said he wouldn't be using that supplier anymore due to months of delays and getting the wrong colour profile for the wheels. I suppose it's possible that there might've been shoddy manufacturing of said batch as well.

Hopefully his next batch of wheels are perfect. I'm using the Evolve GT wheels on my DIY build and I love their feel, softness (76A), and contact pitch (same as kegels!). I'd recommend picking these up.

you can easily adjustt that, basically tto lower to the ground the motor is the more tension is on the belt in this case. (not entirely true but i hope you get my point). To adjust it loosed the top 2 silver screws which go from the blue motor mountt into the carbon fiber plate, tthen you can "rotate" adjustt the motor and how "low"he is. Had to do thatt every 80km or so to adjust the belt tension.

I'm seeing this wheel thing mentioned frequently now. Do you feel Raptors should come as-standard with softer density wheels? Please let us know once you ride on the Abecs.

Original ABEC 11 flywheels are expensive, it would cost enertion a lot more to put those on.  I believe they use clones of the original abec 11 wheels and put enertion branding on them.

Your in the second batch and it looks like these wheels that didnt have the right colour match seem to not have the same integrity as the first batch. ive had no problems to date. Did get some metal bit stuck in it, but wheels fine.

Keep an eye on the truck mount screw. Should be ok, but not so great up close I suppose.


You need to make adjustments to these things and check all the fixings. Before every ride. You dont want the motors coming off at speed.

GHave you check the vesc and leads out for the power. These was an post and email about the pins that could puncture the cables.

Also could the clicking noise be the belt being too close to the internal side 3 silver pins of the motor mount, if the belt isnt aligned prioperly it could be rubbing against that.

Also bearings? Anyway just my thoughts. Its a matter of trying to eliminate what it could not be by some testing, if you work it out let us know. How long have you has the board.

Hey Photorph. I had to apply a hell lot of pressure from many angles on and on until it was loose enough to be pulled out. 
Yeah just stuck em in and it works perfectly!

Little update:
I just did a night ride and flew 40kmh down some streets (no danger but the road itself) and men this thing is soooooo awesome!
Head so many people turning heads and when I rode the subway people looked at my like a was a alien.
Then I had a talk to a guy who wanted to get into electrical motorization of anything and loved it.
In the end I overtake racing bycicles going uphill at about 30kmh an hour. The raptor is so damn quick, I am sure 30-40 in even an incline like this only took about a second or two

As soon as I got the moneys for a cam Ill stuck it on my helmet and get some sweet recordings for Berlin rides

+1 for the abec 83mm 75a. They are pretty widely available at that duro for that size, unlike 90mm and 97mm 75a.

Tested them on my GT and even with way less meat compared to 97mm (the biggest wheels I've seen put on an esk8 besides 107mm) they are still pretty damn smooth. All abecs are golden in my eyes, perfect wheels.

I believe the option for a refund wasnt possible as used albet not for very long. He then offered option to find another buyer to get the refund. Just let him do that and then you can move on.

There was the alternative warranty backing, but you chose not to do that.

Is never good for any party when things dont work out.

Maybe you can sort something further out in PM with enertion or support.They do have the US repair, so at thebvery least it might go back there in there in the meantime for repair and refurb. The thing can get new wheels and any other elec replacements. Happy days for a new owner at discounted price.

Just remember this could still happen to you with any other board you brought. Its just bad luck. Sure Enertion could have done better to avoid the issues, but they are learning. My 2cents worth.

Good luck.

Honestly, as long as you didn't intentionally break it, you should get it fully refunded no problems, and you've only had it for a short time yes? Looked at your video, and the board looks fine. They could probably just replace the wheels and it'd be like new.

I'm thinking of doing a hill test on a 32% hill (ridiculously steep!) WITH 2 people on the board.... wonder if that's too much, don't want to fry my electronics/motors.

just stop if your board is going very slow. That means a lot of amp draw and a lot of stress on the components

Heyho Raptor folk!
Another (one) review :slight_smile:  took it out for a ride on a retired air plane field where a lot of cool people hang out, ride longboards and so on.
I went 45kmh up and down all the time, met some awesome people and we decided to meet up tomorrow, some of them even have an electric board (mostly old evolve ones).
My battery started at 100% and ended at 32%.
I rode about 15-20kmh , didnt keep track but I did so many insane accelerations, videos hopefully coming soon. Cant record by myself without a fitable camera :smile:   
It is just absolutely fun. Flying down the airplane landing road, then carving a bit when wanting to and being watched like a creature from outta space. Was real good fun!
The Abecs are just a dream, get them!
Though I am a little worried because there are some small stones already stuck in them and I cant afford another pair some time soon lol
My first belt got a stone in there so I will replace that later.
I left my trucks a little bit loose and am getting a better feel for 40-45kmh standing and only using the body to apply slow manouvering while the feet stand still like a rock.
Braking worked really well. I think the battery would hold longer if I were not to fly 40kmh for 1-2 kmh, then stop and accelerate hard again. More braking = more power.
I love it!
2 not that good videos were taken, Ill upload it later.
I accelerated really hard but you cannot emphasize that as well when watching from behind instead of from the side (video coming edit: cant upload iphone videos without rerendering so I guess no video for today)
Question to @onloop , I saw a lot of customers get 8 belts, I only have gotten 2. Was that planned? Just a question but I have to order new ones soon anyway :grin:
Doing a lot of unintended advertising around here. Feeling like a pioneer. Almost everyone I talk do would love them to be allowed here in Germany. Its only a matter of time, I am telling you enthusiasts!

@djupex so glad your enjoying the Raptor experience. Hope it lasts. Video yes please.

The other owners may have ordered extra belts. I have an alternative from @Xusia through amazon, but havent tried getting them myself, but meant to be cheaper and work with Rpator set up.

has anyone confirmed these work?

By the way to everyone here, always check your belts after each ride for things in there or things poking out.  Rocks get stuck there often, specially in the pulleys!  You don't want to be riding with anything stuck in the belts.  I've already had to open my wheel 3 times to take rocks out of the pulley

This has been a total nightmare. Biggest regret ever was ordering from enertion. If it was a board ordered from amazon I would have returned it as soon as it broke and had 100% of my money.  No way I will get it all back.  I pay for shipping back because of an electrical flaw that will affect alot of this new batch. I will have a new vesc and handle shipped to me and maybe fix it if it doesn't sell.

Amazon is free shipping back for defective products, but I agree you can't compare a multi billion dollar company to a dude in his garage. You have understand going in that you may experience problems and these problems may not be as painless to fix as if you bought it from a well established company. I think a lot of people get too used to the type of customer service that an entity like Amazon gives.

Trust me I know. Working in retail, I always get the customer who screams and shouts "I paid $2000 for this laptop and it's already broken??". Some people don't understand that this isn't a perfect world and some components can be defective from the get go. Parts can wear down but they don't 'age' like we do. A defect free esk8 mount sitting in a garage for 10 years won't be worse or worn down over that time.

@sandbound definitely don't think you're being unreasonable, and it sucks that you have had such problems in such a short amount of time. Hope it works out for you in the end.

Unfortunately, you probably can't actually ship it back to me because I am in Australia & you are in America, the battery is considered a "dangerous goods" so it is complicated.

I apologise for this issues & I would like to repair it for your but you are not interested in that

Therefore I offered an alternate solution, I will refund you the entire amount if we find a new owner! (which should be fairly easy).. Just say the words and ill help you. The new owner will get the board sent to them once the issues are resolved by our US-based repair agent.

I have said it before & ill say it again, raptor customers get the royal treatment! whatever it takes i'll make it happen.....

And I believe what Enertion is offering is technically covering more than just "manufacturing defects" per se. Were you to, for example, ride through a deep enough puddle and manage to get enough water damage to the boostedboard that the motors packed in I believe they may say this was "user error" and therefore not covered by their warranty, whereas (if I'm correct) Enertion is saying if ANYTHING goes wrong in the first year they got your back 100% regardless (assuming you didn't do something intentionally damaging obviously). Please correct me if I'm mistaken.

Even Marbel has a full 1 year warranty with no need to upgrade.  They may have been the first to offer that. They email me a free shipping label and I would get it back before the next weekend. They are a new board company too and it would fail 6 times in the first 6 months but they extended my warranty for 6 months. since then it has been amazing despite the shitty reputation they created for themselves.  I don't think the board is ready yet to be sold outside the US. International orders are still waiting.

Great review mate. One cut- no fluff! Really enjoyed the insight, you spoke very well. On a side note, has anyone put the black evolve GT 83mm's on the Raptor yet? They are soft (not sure how they compare to the stock Raptor items), with a good contact patch, and the black on black might look good. Remotes are a critical part of the e-skate experience, but no one seems to have nailed them perfectly yet. Looking forward to seeing what comes out next in the scene. Hopefully one day open source/ modular + ruggedised + small + smooth + display.

after now around 550km my pulley is asymetrical, meaning no longer round wobbels and definetly increased the noise. It is has also a bigger distance from the motor mount. I don't want to run in to long like this since more vibrations are usualy bad. Anyone else had the problem ? Just order a new pulley mount that thing up and be done with it right ?

Anyway I think it's very easy to replace that part, just need a small allen wrench that fits into the little screw on it.  The rest is on a video I saw on the enertion youtube page.

So today I thought I would really test the Raptor. It was 28 celcius and I did this journey:

[The route](https://www.google.ch/maps/dir/Arboretum,+Mythenquai,+8002+Z%C3%BCrich/47.4002223,8.51548/@47.3745903,8.5105901,13z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m19!4m18!1m15!1m1!1s0x479009fe61336d29:0xa5872810a7916b07!2m2!1d8.5362546!2d47.3627548!3m4!1m2!1d8.5747367!2d47.3490685!3s0x479aa72383b89b1f:0xe80c56207adbd425!3m4!1m2!1d8.5605528!2d47.3582441!3s0x479aa749c9dbb0df:0x78e79fb3bbc25d95!1m0!3e1)

Nice ride with 2 serious inclines. I was lucky and had good road conditions so I could power through the inclines on 25-30km/h. At the Top i didn't only have a nice view, but also a rather "cool" board. I had again no issues at all. Thouhg I have to admit for some reason the more distance I put on this thing the louder its gets. Now I definetly have (on lower speeds) a very high pitched humming of sorts and and on higher spees a clicking rattling noise. Nevertheless it got me up there and damn quick. I know I know shoulda recorded the journey with an app, I just forgot :frowning: 

I recorded it but need to upgrade to a gopro. Cheap old clone its just embarassing to lock at the footage. Until there is a video, here is a pic :slight_smile:

Very fair assessment.  It's unfortunate enertion takes so long to help out.  They have a great product, I'd go as far as saying one of the best complete boards in the market WHEN working.  Luckily mine didn't have any issues that's why I love it...but that opinion would have changed if I had your experience.  They need better quality assurance (like soldering etc) and to improve response time a lot.  I know it's an "out of garage" operation and I'm pretty understanding, but other customers will not be thus they cannot afford to take one month to reply to emails.  It needs to be 2-3 days max, if they can't do that...then they need to hire staff with a somewhat high pay to keep them there.

Chris, so glad you persisted with trying to fix it even though thats not what you were expecting having to do. Especially given so little use. I know in your first video and subsequent posts that you were thinking about off loading it as Enertion gave you that option of them selling it for you.

When the Raptor works theres nothing available like it other than the Evolve GT. Hope the rest of the ownership is trouble free. Make sure you always check all the nuts and bolt. Before and after rides. Also helmet is essential.

Given the raptor works...i'd still prefer it over evolve GT if you put softer flywheels on it.  Reason is, raptor is small/lighter and easier to carry and to me that's important.  Also raptor has a higher top speed by quite a bit when using 83mm wheels on both.

@sandbound thanks for your honest review Chris.  It's probably worth noting you could have sent the board to our US repair agent and had everything repaired for free. These issues are all covered in the 12 months warranty. You made the decision not to do that so we sent replacement parts for free instead. You did a great job fixing it. Having parts sent out would not be an option if you purchased a boosted board.

Also. I would like to update you on some other matters.
1. The problem with excess motor wires has been resolved now.  No motors have excess wires inside now. It was just one batch.
2. The vesc now have a new capacitor board design. This resolves every issue you mentioned including the wire and pin piercing issue.
3. We have 3 dedicated customer support employees now. We had zero before. And our tickets are being answered in a timely manner. We also fired our chat provider as they were useless. We do it all in house now. Lots for the staff to learn but we are starting to get positive feedback already.
4. The remote has been discontinued due to the button placement. They are easy to break if impacted. New remote available soon if you are interested in that all raptor owners will be given a special deals via the VIP club.
5. We have developed our own wheels now. They are made in california. And we are using premium urethane. This will be offered to VIP customers soon also.

Let me know if you have any other product feedback. We are always greatful to receive information on how we can improve our products.

You are right that you did offer to fix it if I box it up and ship it out. If I sent it out when I had vesc issues would the motor issues have been caught at the same time? Possibly. But I think I would have gotten it back a week or two later and had the solder joint break 3 miles later. My God I would been so FU**IN pissed. I'm glad you are making changes and correcting the issues one by one. If mine had never broke I would have singing your praises to anyone that would listen. I have said it's a fantastic board when it works and I mean it just alot of problems for me.  I realize I'm only 1 customer out of hundreds that buy your products. The new motor you sent is perfect I know that won't be an issue anymore.

anyone know why I can't add updates to my original thread anymore?  Well whatever.  For new raptor owners, please keep adding your positive or negative experience with the raptor here.  

I personally think going with the winning remote was a bad idea.  They seem to have too many issues.  What's the most reliable remote in your opinion that the raptor should come stock with?

You need to replace the bearing shield. Not sure how you're supposed to do it with a flanged bearing, but normal bearings have a c-clip that retains the shield on the bearing.

Though your ball bearings may be deformed by this point, in which you need another bearing (F608ZZ)

Unfortunately they look like pressed in metal shields which in this case according to the below video are not serviceable.

@Nate, good call thought I was the only one that took a look at everything inside when originally installing and I added weather strip foam to keep everything solidly in place. Did not even think to post about it figured I was one that got a little loose fitting set up.

Hey guys.
Quick question, after 13 month and 3000km+ I have an issue I seem not to be able to figure out.
So the problem:

When riding there is a lot more noise, vibration and batery usage. If taken everythink a part that i can. To me it seems as the only thing that would make sense to me, is that the stator(?), coming out of the motor must be bent, since ther is an oval mosion happening while runing it. Could it be improved with new pullys (since they loock a little uneven too) or do I need to fix the stator ? if that is even possible. Tried to take pictures but you dont see anything :(. If requierd I could make a small video.

I already wrote them an e-mail about a sort of check up. Since I put so much miles on it, I wanted a service check up like you would get on your DH bike or car. ( SInce the battery has lost a lot of punch, mounts are corroded, deck has sprains, all the "shugry" holding wires and vescs in place came off, all the inside parts were flying around etc. SO i wanted it serviced with the possibility to get a new battery pack, of course I don't expect it to be free). They replied that they forwarded my qeustion to the right "departement" and they will go over it with me as soon as possible. I got that answer on the 26. of february. So since the issue with the motor is newer I haben't yet contacted them about that, since the older issues are still open and so far not much has happened. I know they are super busy with the raptor 2, but I would sadden me to let my raptor 1 die. Of course I could potentially fix most of it myself.....

And @Dedbny no I have not. I  don't know that much about motors, so I need to read up on them first before I take things apart or try to fix it.

Onloop told me on Reddit they have stock for raptor 1 customers, he said they have a whole new system for customer service where they reply quickly and service boards quickly.   Hold Enertion accountable for doing that,  if you're still under warranty they should cover most of it.

I thought we got extension, but not 100% sure.  And even if warranty is out, based on what Jason himself said... they still resolve issues for raptor 1 customers.  If they aren't resolving your issues, be vocal about it.  You paid a good amount of money for your raptor and it should last a very long time.

Get the motors fixed by Enertion or have them replace it.  If warranty is out I guess they can charge you, but should still give you speedy service as they claim they are doing from now on.

FYI


[–]photorph 1 point 7 hours ago 
what about past raptor 1 owners? Are they just left hanging?

[–]onloop [score hidden] 5 minutes ago 
The Raptor 2 internal components are backward compatible, it can all fit inside the carbon fiber deck. So if we need to do warranty repair we can do it no problems.

Hi, we are not too busy. If you need help with your raptor, whether it's in warranty or not we will try our best to help you. I suppose our process depend's what country you are in.

If you are needing motors we don't stock them anymore, but @longhairedboy or @unik sell the enertion r-spec style motors, they have their own brand on them now but they will work as they are identical & either of those guys would be happy to help you with the install for a small fee.

If you need a battery tune up in the USA for enertion space cell, the best guy is @barajabali

I have VESCX in stock if you think there is something wrong with the vesc. & any of the guys above can tune those & install them for you.

We can get that Raptor reworked & pumping again. Just ask @thomwithah

I'll do raptor retro motor upgrades for the price of the motors and shipping the board. In other words. I'll do them basically for free. Its a wonderful platform and dead easy to work on. 

The V1 Raptors have the perfect setup for my seonsored motors. And if you're looking for a different pulley ratio, i also have pulleys of various tooth counts that can replace the standard 36T wheel pulley, like 33T pulleys if you simply...

Thank you for your response. I will check out the probality and the costs of all the options.  Battery wise I will probably just do another 10s3p pack, to replace the old one.
Im in switzerland wich makes a lot of things harder I guess.
Thank you though.

Damn, well my Raptor officially died on me after 4037km. Question @onloop , should I contact enertion support or you for that matter, or would it be more efficient to search for help in a "troubleshooting" thread. Saddly I need to travel to my dad's mancave for the porper tools. Saddly cannot give you any details yet. Just what I can observe. 1 motor doen't turn at all, the second one does turn but only very slow and very loud. I had no isses prior to that. Just picked the board up and tunred it on and nothing really worked....

I was able to take care of the minor things back then. And he actualy far diagnosed for me whats wrong with the motors and engouraged me that It should be fairly easy to fix it by myself. So I read up on it and fixed it. I would have done it,  but with the 2 times shipping it would take for ever and be very costly.

Oh thats not good news, so you keep riding your board that has known faults? That's a really bad idea also very unsafe. It also makes repair harder and possibly more costly.

Maybe more parts are damaged now?

Depending on service report there may be some fees involved for this one. Please email support and send it to Belgium agent for review...

Let's hope nothing major.
