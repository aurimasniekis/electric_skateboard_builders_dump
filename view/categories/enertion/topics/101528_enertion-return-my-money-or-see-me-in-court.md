Finally got my hearing done with NCAT, I now have a court enforceable order for Enertion / Jason Potter to return my money. Is that enough for you Enertion or are we going to add some court costs to your bill? In 14 days, if I have not received a full refund, I'll be filing in court for the refund, legal fees, and any reasonable expenses I have incurred. 

If you attempt delivery on the board, it will be rejected at Enertion's cost.

Knowing Jason has fled this forum, I would add this to whatever support tickets you have with them, drop a new ticket, send it to any of the enertion public emails and maybe send it as a letter (with tracking/reception confirmation).

Keep the original.

I'm in the same boat. I haven't seen any of the Enertion guys on the forum for a bit either. I am a little worried about them at the moment as I don't ever want to be part of something that forces a business to go bankrupt just because they have run into a bit of financial trouble. However, I think I have been more than accommodating in offering them options for a refund and I haven't heard anything back from them, so it honestly seems like court is the only way to go in order to get my money back. It's a shame though.

I think in the end we just all want reliable companies providing awesome products. Those who repeatedly failed to meet promised deadlines by several weeks or months and strategically try to discourage or prevent customers from getting the support they are entitled to have no business running a business.

It may appear as if there are a few incidents if you read through this forum, but when looking at reddit and their YouTube channel combined... There are allot of customers who have not received their products or support (ranging from wobbly wheels to missing raptors to the obvious candidate... The unity).

Paperwork has been served to all the relevant emails as well as Jason's house and to his companies address. The papers were actially served by the tribunal, so no worries there. Court summons will be the same. These guys have serious balls thinking they can just ignore the law and it will go away.

Good thing for me is Jason (not just his company) is named in the order to pay, so I'll be sueing him directly, as well as his company. You think they'd just pay me my lawful refund rather than get tied up in this mess of litigation. But that's the type of company we're dealing with unfortunately.

Hmm. This is highly concerning really. You would think that they would just refund rather than go through the bullshit.

It really makes you wonder where they are at. It seems as if they are almost at a pivotal point from what they say...

Yep. Jason/Enerion does own this forum. Jason banned himself after banning another forum member for 1000 years for something that happened outside of the forum. That something was the forum member continually posted the issues he had with all the broken Raptor 2's/parts they sent him over the course of 2 years. He wanted to hide it in order to continue "sales". Which means he kept wanting to take money from unsuspecting buyers without shipping products to previous purchasers. He's a pretty gross forum owner and business man. And it shows as evidenced by him not even being able to pay his employees.

P.S.- He's systembot. He thinks we're all idiots.

I just got a tracking number for my board. Bunch of others did too. How do I know this? They emailed a bunch of us with pending orders last June about a delay and didn‚Äôt use the BCC field lol. Bunch of us stayed in touch via ‚Äúreply all‚Äù to compare progress of our orders. So they‚Äôre moving product now it seems. Can‚Äôt wait to get it. 

How long did you wait? Took me 5 months. I figured going in, based on YouTube clips, reviews etc that they were a young bunch of skater boys trying to start a biz so I set my expectations accordingly, gave them benefit of the doubt. I know it sucks to wait so long, believe me I know üòÇ.

Just wait until they don't have replacement parts to repair what is inevitably going to break. The boards are very poorly QC'd. They look pretty cool though. Wear an armored suit. You're going to need it.

Absolutely this is a concern. I asked Roan at Toronto Ruckus about this and he said they moved to a supplier in California and better wheels will be available then. He said anything in stock ships out in reasonable time and the new supplier should be quicker, and the recent change in chemistry should improve wheel longevity tremendously. Just gotta say though, the board made quite an impression to those in attendance. If it truly is the Lambo of boards, maybe it also shares bay-queen status too? Dunno yet. Will let you know.

They've been saying this same thing for over 2 years now. You must not have done your research. They say these things to get sales. Obviously it worked on you. A meepo board is the lambo of boards when compared to the R2. I've owned 3 R2's. They will break down in no time and most likely lock up and try and kill you. Also, Enertion isn't in a place to replace the parts under warranty efficiently or in a timely matter. You don't have to let me know. I'm just trying to warn you. There are much faster, more reliable boards out there for that kinda money. Have fun dealing with the Enertion train reck.

I'll find out what my options are next week, I just wanted to give Enertion 2 weeks to respond before I begin wracking up expenses. I do intend to prosecute to the full extent of the law though, even if I can't recollect my funds, these guys need to be stopped from putting other people in my situation.

Once I see my lawyer however, I don't think that continuing to give updates will help my case. I will definitely update when the matter comes to a close though.

Just want to thank you for this. It's something I would have done personally, but with recent health issues (my fiance, not me) I wasn't in a place for it to be feasible monetarily. One man income for my family now. But Enertion has been fucking over customers for far too long and hiding it by deleting "This board almost killed me" posts and much more. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.

I really hoping this isnt the end for enertion I have been a big fan since the raptor 1 hit the streets. But I feel his pain I have to deal with china for components for my own business (Nothing to with esk8) and delays broken promises and substitute are the order of the day I suspect some delight in getting one over on us western devils. There are others that continue to suprise me going out of their way and own expence to make sure I get what I paid for.. Sucks to see another Gold Coast business have hard times I wish I could help. When I heard rumors of the new evolve a month ago part of me was hoping Jeff would buy out enertion and offer it as the evolve raptor. I have a dead raptor 2 in my workshop its a brilliant board although this one is water damaged by previous owner I would love to upgrade restore it to 2.1 status.

They changed to message on the Unity pre-Order that the next batch will ship in October (you prob know that)

I would think after the disaster that the situation has caused this shipping estimate would be taken seriously. My friend is waiting for his, that I convinced him to buy.

I don't want to order one from Enertion... but if they show up on shelves....

My bank ended up removing the funds from Enertion, they still haven't responded to either my banks requests for information, or to the legal order demanding them to pay. They're just a bunch of incompetent morons, way in over their heads. My nightmare is finally over, and I can finally purchase a board that will last more than a few weeks of riding (if I even bother pursuing this hobby again), and I wont have to worry so much about breaking my neck when a wheel decides its time to fall off, or a motor decides its time to lock up. 40km/h is not a speed you want to be eating the pavement at.

Good luck to everyone that decided to stick behind Enertion. While I think anyone riding an Enertion board is just putting themselves at real physical and financial risk, I hope you all ended up with good boards and never have to go through the pain of needing to contact Enertion.

To Enertion, and any of the staff that constantly mislead, ignore, or simply don't care. Fuck you.

For the record, mine was ordered early March, you managed to receive your board before I even received a response, that's the type of true assholes you're dealing with here.

They actually thought they'd give me a hard time, because I had the gall to ask for a refund for something I'd been waiting for, for three times longer than advertised. How dare I.

Also to anyone who is riding these boards, you might want to take a look at https://www.fairtrading.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/257154/acl-product-safety.pdf specifically sections 7 & 8. I have a strong suspicion that Enertion isn't complying with section 7, and section 8 outlines the rights a consumer has to address the issue.

If anyone injures themselves, please report it here https://www.productsafety.gov.au/contact-us/for-consumers/report-an-unsafe-product

Good luck fam.

If a company pretends to be professional, certain things are expected of them...such as proper support and communication.

That things might be different for parts that are manufactured based on demand by small shop owners is a whole different story.

Call me old fashioned, but when a company says 6-8 weeks, it means 6-8 weeks, not 6-8 months.

In my case it was 8 weeks of waiting followed by an email saying my board was in pre-production and would be finished off by the end of May with delivery during June, didn't happen.

Then I started emailing the company on multiple occasions, which they ignored for 2-3 weeks. 

That's when I created my account here, and made my first thread asking what in the fuck was going on and why were me and 30 other customers in an email thread all being ignored?

Not so surprisingly Adrian, their COO immediately responded to me (took him about 20mins to respond) in private, offering me to jump the delivery queue if I deleted my post. Again, they failed to deliver on their unethical promise.

So I demanded a refund, and they refused, stating they were broke, and my money was lied up in some legal battle they were having in China. I summoned them to a government tribunal, they didn't show up. I send them a demand to pay me a refund, written by the authority of the state government, they ignored that too. Finally my bank came through on their investigation which was about 2 months old at this point, because for the entire time of my banks investigation, Enertion didn't respond to them either.

Just keep in mind, all this bullshit was occuring while Jason was on tour travelling around the world racking up more victims.

So while you may think it's "funny that people complain" about companies acting like this, the court, the banks, and myself fail to see the humor.

Welcome to the world of fringe hobbies mate. I'm glad you got your money back but this is nothing new in this world. Lots of people lost money buying carvon drives, motor mounts, vescs, decks; literally everything you can think of. This story isn't the first I've seen and won't be the last. 
If something says "pre-order" or "made to order" I suggest you purchase with caution as, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo you have no guarantee of actually getting anything. I suggest if you don't want to wait then go to your local shop and buy an evolve or a boosted as DIY will involve waiting as well.

I am in no way justifying enertion etc this is more of a warning to others looking to put money into similar "investments".

That just the way vendors in this industry work. There's only a handful that even have the money to stock major components like vescs and even large quantities of motors and drives. 

I've personally waited 18 months for carvon drives, 6 months for hummies, 8 weeks for focboxes and that's before we even talk about my unity. It's not a shit attitude as much as it is a reality check. 

Don't pre-order anything unless you understand the risks.

Are you for real? What to expect from an Australian company is clearly written in law. If the **company** doesn't understand the risks of running a preorder production model, they should expect to face chargebacks and an extreme loss of good will from their customer base. 

I'm not one to hang around holding onto my ankles, and I dont take amusement in consumers being taken advantage of in any industry. If youre happy to wait 18 months for shit to not get delivered, all the power to you; I hope your status quo never changes.
