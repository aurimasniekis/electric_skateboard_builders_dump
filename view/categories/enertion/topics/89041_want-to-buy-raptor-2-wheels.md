the urethane formula is currently shit, but the new formula is better

new wheels should be back this month (according to enertion at least)

Hopefully they can get ontop of the urethane problem soon.

Are there any other sleeves that would fit on the hub motors instead of using enertions?

Until they spend the money to make good wheels, they will keep putting out crappy wheels...  good wheels are not cheap and if enertion sold them, they would have to be $100 each to fit their profit margin.

Their new batches aren't that bad, I rode them for 20 miles straight throttle pegged most of the time trying to keep up with two people I was riding with

It takes a lot to get a good formula. Luckily, working with abec for the past couple of decades, a&e engineers learned how to make a good formula. We were blown away. Everything else we had made.for us or we made, even the dream thane, is crap in comparison. A lot of wheel markers but few seem to know formulas. It just costs a fortune. These prototype wheels cost $50 each.
