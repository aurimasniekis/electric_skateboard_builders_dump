Hi guys @barajabali @CarlCollins  

thought I give some feedback about my raptor 2.1 and my experience with enertion in general.
Overall I am very happy I finally got my hands on it and it looks well built. But I have a few comments to make.
Its very early as I just got it this morning.

VERY fast UPS shipping - 4 days including weekend from HongKong to Switzerland. Well done!

First off the right front wheel has a very bad wobble and I thought we got past these wobble issues - not looking like it. Carl is telling me I have to wait until march for new wheels - thats not really acceptable and wheels are in stock on enertions website.

Enertion also forgot to send me the spare wheels and remote that I ordered with my raptor 2.1.
Sad because I would have had wheels to exchange the wobbly front wheels then... everything is listed stock on the website so what gives?

Had a short chat with someone at the Enertion website. Fast, good information. Liked it.

Other than that my raptor 2.1 looks quite well... not perfect but alright:
- there are scratches on my board (they say its a manufacturing issue and every raptor2.1 is affected)
- my front truck has a small chip in the paint. would really love to see these trucks anodized instead.
- only one of the supposed 2 layers of wood are dyed blue - the other one is natural wood with a hint of blue

the Enertion remote is much better than anticipated. We all know its a kind of nano remote v2 but its sturdier (better plastic housing) and at least the throttle wheel is not crooked like on the nano. good spring tension, I like it a lot so far.

push to start feature is not working yet. don't know if this still an upcoming feature or it should work already. its activated in the unity app but the board does not power up after a push.

I don't get the firmware feature of the app - where and how can I update the unity firmware? is there a tutorial?

First ride was very short because I just can't push it with that very bad wobbling front wheel. But performance is good - not shocking at all but good. My diy 12s4p dual belt 6374 has a lot more torque but I really like the smoothness of the r-spec mode. Could use stronger brakes.

I am able to arrange a replacement for you but I'm not sure if they will be without any wobble issue 
Also, February will be off for China, That's why I said March 2019 as worst case scenario

Thanks Carl. I guess in this case my ordered spare wheels are taking longer too right?

Should have some TB frontwheels somewhere. So lets wait till wobblefree wheels are available.

Going for a freezing night ride tonight :slight_smile:

Hello @McErono

Thank you for your valuable feedback! 

First of all I am very sorry your were sent a set of wobbling wheels. I know Carl is going to take care of that issue for you ASAP.

[/quote]
I find that you need to kick to start to maybe 7-9 mph before the raptor will engage. Have you tried this? Also you will need to be sure that it is enabled in the tool.

[/quote]

You can either use the Andriod app (Not ideal) OR you can use the PC version. You will need to connect to the Unity with a USB C cable and the firmware can be updated right in the app. https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/

Scroll down to the specs area and you should click the Focbox UI Windows link.

I would like to see pictures of these.  Not the wobbly wheel, but the other stuff.


Maybe it is significant, but my guess is it is not.  I can find imperfections in any product I have purchased. EVER.

No it works fine but its not great for updating firmware as it takes a long time for the file to load I suppose and then the signal drops out.

Its great for config purposes though

Fine and "could drop out mid-OTA update" aren't really in the same category to me.

But you do you!

On a serious note, perhaps a compiled list of current known issues or things to look out for with this brand new drop of hardware/software might be of use to builders here.

Personally, my expectations are pretty firmly set when it comes to testing out first revision hardware. There's a certain amount of responsibility anyone accepts when they purchase brand new hardware, but knowing what are known issues being worked on currently vs random Gremlins in the system can be really helpful for those troubleshooting their first builds.

@barajabali thank you bara!

7-9mph - I was just pushing once, hard, but nowhere near 7-9mph! thats quite a lot... life is to short for... you know. :sweat_smile:

I expected the unity mobile app to go online and tell me if my firmware is up to date. if not it should download the latest version.  At the moment I think the app seems offline only and only manual firmware updates are possible? I also can‘t find a version number of the current firmware installed. Is 3.41 out yet?

for the rest - no really no guys. a few minor scratches and a tiny chip in one truck that is going to be there anyway after the first ride, don‘t ruin any reputation nor my board. And I kind of like the undyed layer... My TB stuff doesn‘t look different brand new (worse for that matter - totally scratched enclosure, motors) and it is certainly not ruining anything.

the wobbly wheels is something else... must be really annoying for enertion (known for months and visited the factory) and a damn ecological disaster :-(

btw. the griptape is not centered on the deck - could be improved as well and I would like the griptape to cover the whole deck to the edges.

The wobbly wheels is a big problem. 

If enertion were my company I’d express ship my customer a new set of wheels free of wobble immediately and take the loss. 

I can’t have my customer receiving their brand new board and not be able to ride it.

I experienced the same problem and can confirm enertion @CarlCollins sent me replacement wheels not once but 3 times. Yes there are wobbly wheels but to their credit enertion replaces them till you are happy. I also found that the 100mm crossovers and 90mm wheels had little to no wobble but the 97mm were the worst for wobbling. I did get a lot of wheels too. Durability wise I have been using them for several hundred km and they are wearing very well so it seems they have got the urethane formula down now.

Yeah the Unity on my DIY is the same I had to push it quite hard and takes some time before it boots up and connects. I got off my board thinking it didn't work after the 3rd try to see it was on. Imo the kick push to start is a bit inconvenient it's much easier to reach down and turn it on via the switch and then you know it's fully on and calibrated before you step foot on the baord.

This is no complaint - its just to show you where we are at.

two months gone by, still no raptor 2.1 in my house. still no remote, still no spare wheels.
I don't know the reasons but enertion told me that everything should arrive at the end of this month. the focbox unity I ordered last did arrive already.

this has to improve enertion. you can't ship a faulty board and let your customer wait over 2 months after he waited more than half a year to get that faulty board. 

again not really a complaint because I hope the buildquality did improve and spring is just starting. I just wonder why there are so little raptor 2.1 shipped.

@McErono
I understand mate and I apologize as well,
We have tried 3 times to ship the Raptor 2.1 (brand new) to you from China but Swiss Custom is too strict now, so we decided to get the board's to FatDaddy (our official reseller now)  which will be there this week then they will ship a board for you with all the accessories.
I think this is the best solution for this :slight_smile:

Hi, 
I will probably receive my awaited Raptor in a couple of weeks after 6 months of patience as support wrote it to me during last chat.
I am not posting about the delay that was toooooooo long, but my motivations deal with the fact that this board will be my first electric one, and I need your assistance de identify the check-list to confirm that there is no trouble with the manufacturing.
My second question concerns how do you prtect your board of daily scratch or small accident. we can find on interne many 3rd part equipment to protect the board when it is from evolve, but about enertion, it seems that nobody is doing protection customized or standard.

Hello All,

I require your assistance as Enertion does not:
Yesterday I've sent a mail to enertion support including 2 questions:
1) how thick is the edge of the board to order the right size of trim-lok
2) recommendation on 3rd part component to buy (shredlight)

**Question:**

> Hi all,
> to order Tail/nose/edge protection from trim-lok, I need to know how thick is the board to identify which trim-lok serie/model I have to use for my future board.
> I plan also to add white/front red/back lights, which models of shredlights do you recommend to use, and do I need to add hardware between the board and light to attach?

**Answer:** 
> Hey Frederic,
> 
> We do not have any recommendation. You can check the ESK8 forum for better suggestions. 
> 
> Kind Regards,
> 
> Mike Schmeller
> Enertion Support

Can someone help me to get the answer to this question: how thick is the edge of a Raptor 2.1 please?
as I wish to order trim-lock edge guard:![](https://www.trimlok.com/secure/content/imagesproducts/edge-trim-main_290_0.jpg)

Thanks a lot to all of you,
I don't know how, but a message was inserted between my 2 one without taking care of timeline.
But as this message is including the so needed data the objective is reached, great.

Another question: looking for shredlights,
I've found into shredlights knowledge base this information: https://support.shredlights.com/article/205-enertion-raptor-2-1

It is not possible to attach dual red light on the tail as it is for the nose.
Which sol are you using for light?
How do you attach lights to board?

Welcome into the club, shipment is pending since Nov 2018...
Queuing delivery to customers is endemic to Enertion, one of my friends told to me: their boards are one of the fastest but to fit a standard statistic distribution law, they have to go slowly for shipping like that average is in the middle (joke).

I think you're making this a bit more complicated than it needs to be. Here's the shopping list https://shredlights.com/collections/shop/products/combo-pack

Doesn't matter if it's 2.0 or 2.1. There's no R2 specific bracket. Either of them work. These brackets are thin enough to bend if you need to make more room or if you want to have them at an angle ect... I would be more worried about the quality of the board when you get it and how long it will last. These lights should be the least of your worries. ;)

OK, sorry this board will be my first electric one. Certainly I spent a lot of energy to deal with subsidiary questions. 
To complete my defense, I would tell that also it was a long job to drain out a small part of an answer from Enertion's mouth. As I was a little bit disappointed, in March I was close to renounce to my order and let 20% of the price go away. So I spent time surfing internet to finalize my wish list to be ready to use my board ASAP.
As I am a novice, I use to read online guideline and support documents provided by vendors, and I've read  that shredlights was compatible with single light for the tail and dual for the front. this information was the trigger of my questions.

Now let speak about a real show-stopper:

What alert are you raising ? 
honestly, Enertion into my mind is a premium vendor for board performance and resiliency, is he?
Are they selling low quality, with short Time To Live?
As I am a novice, can you tell me which elements I have to monitor/check?
Do you have some REX (Return of Experience) to share?

Well no... sean has his own history with enertion and I am worried too. 

My first board was just bad in any way and the new motors... honestly they are bad. no range, overheating all the time. I would not buy a raptor again ever. I am sorry but such a bad board and I am still waiting for it (rma) so in total I paid the board freaking 10 months ago and still have no board, no spare wheels, no spare remote... tell me any company that takes 10 months to deliver some wheels?!

Its insane and all I am hearing are the same excuses again and again.

Then you get your board and all you have is issue after issue. I really hoped bara could turn this into something worthwhile but I don't know what is going on with enertion. :sweat:

On top of all I paid 70usd to ship this sucker to germany... no you wont get a shipping refund even though you just got a broken board out of the box.

I can't blame bara nor carl, rehan... anybody I had contact with did his best to help me but enertion has bad logistics partners, bad suppliers. I feel for them... but its their responsibility and they just failed big time.

[/quote]

Used to be in my opinion. I've only received partially working products that last no longer than 80 miles at a time. I've owned the R2 for over 2 years and only been able to ride a total of 180-200 miles between my 1st board they sent me and a replacement (warranty). Months waiting between replacement parts, then those replacement parts would break, not work, ect... 

[quote="Pura-Vida, post:46, topic:81607"]

[/quote]

Everything except for the deck. Don't touch any type of water with the board. Not even a 1 inch puddle. Don't go faster than 10mph or you'll overheat. Tighten all the nuts and bolts because they lack proper QC. Watch it when your charging the board. The BMS likes to stop working. The list goes on. You can google all the customers experience online for more info.

[quote="Pura-Vida, post:46, topic:81607"]

[/quote]

Kinda long story. After I provided all proof (pictures and videos) when these things would happen for the length of a year and a half. The owner Jason decided it would be a good business move to try and publicly make me look like the fool. When I obliged to having send in my board in to be "fixed" by his repair team the board still only worked for a few miles before I had to step in once again and fix it myself. Which I don't mind. It's the only way that I was able to ride it. I just wanted a production board that was quality that I wouldn't have to mess with as a 2nd and 3rd board. This didn't happen. It's not the repair teams fault. It's the lack of quality of the product that they have to work with. There is little to no Quality Control or Testing for that matter. If the owner didn't treat me so poorly I don't think I would be so pissed. But his logic is that of a girlfriend that cheats on you and then has the nerve to get pissed off at you for catching her. I wouldn't recommend this board to anyone. You can easily make a board yourself that kills it in performance and doesn't have the issues. Not to mention cost as much.

In january I still had a firmware with false thermalthrottling. the board would fly up a hill but after a few seconds (!) it was stalling and in my case coming to a standstill. this should be fixed now. but look at that 430wh battery... range 15km. thats very very inefficient! 

the unity is great. its the motors that are bad.

Unfortunately I've bought my raptor 2.1 before to read your comments.
I think they is satisfy or cash back agreement with Enertion. I hope, as after reading your message I gonna test it as much as I can before the end of this period.

How do you know that it is heating? There is some temperature gauge, alert.automattic power off system?

Yep. On the 2.1's they do. @Deodand can explain more on that one. On mine (2.0) the truck would get so hot after a couple miles that it could actually burn me.

We've got plenty of happy customers too, so remember not to take one opinion as the final. I've got two raptor twos of my own and they work great, though I'm coming from a very biased position working with Enertion so :man_shrugging:, I'm not really the type to lie about it though. The main issue we've been having is consistency, most boards work great and a minority have some issues. @barajabali and our team works hard everyday to make sure the issues that make it through our checks get fixed. The raptor is an evolving product and a lot of the changes we've made both in terms of components and assembly process have helped   improve reliability and we've seen that in reduced failure rates reported through warranty. We do still have a long way to go but none of us are giving up any time soon. 

The motors get hot, and are designed to run hot if you ride them hard. The motor controller makes sure they don't overheat and damage themselves but I definitely wouldn't pick the board up by its trucks (good thing it has handles). Pretty much all hub motors that output performance comparable to the raptor are going to get warm under intense riding. 

You can look at @SeanHacker history and see that he has a habit of getting into long arguments about how terrible our products are. I'm sure he has good reasons but just wanted to provide a bit of the other perspective besides just that we are a terrible incompetent company, and the stuff we make is worthless. Cheers!

I wasn't really around for it but I've heard his side of the story and understand what he's upset about. I'm not trying to suggest he shouldn't be. From what I've heard it sounds like a lot of unfortunate things occurred. But angry people are much more likely to hop on a forum and become keyboard warriors than the happy customers who are enjoying their boards. That's just my 2 cents don't really need to rehash out this whole thing for the hundredth time anyways.

Hi Deodand,

I use to construct my own opinion on my own experience, but as a 25 years of experiences engineer working on IT, I use also to take in consideration experiences from other users, to reduce risks and take the appropriate decision or go to mitigation before escalation.
Sean experiences seems to be the worst example of a customer experience. And I hope that your support process is fixed, as once is not good, looping will be leathal to your business.

From my recent experience, from order to deliver process has to be seriously updated, as it is not good to pay full price and discover later that your order has to spend time into an undefined queue...
Support are unable to share with you good information or technical tips...
But let see, last week my order was scheduled for this week, we are still Thursday, one more day before weekend...

Yes, it's something we are working toward everyday. I think everyone knows what we want to achieve as a customer experience, but as a small company with limited resources undergoing rapid growth it is extremely challenging to execute on that vision. 

All we can do is keep working hard, listening to our customers and improving our systems to better address the challenges.

I've now driven my Raptor about 250miles. I am satisfied so far, performance is great but I have some points of criticism.

- A motor has a not working Hall sensor. 
- PU won't last much longer and has some cracks already
- Range, this is one thing I need to test before I make a final judgment.

Otherwise, every day I have the need to go out and shred with the raptor 2.1. We finally have over 20 degrees in germany. Let's see if my motors overheat or the range gets better. 

stay tuned

Hi Deodand,

Agility and transparency do not require any financial investment, it is a question of mind and spirit.

Some quick wins to share with you:
1)  Prior to finalize an order, notice a time to deliver (average time to deliver collected during last 3 months, expected time to deliver for this order, and define a deadline to deliver),

2) Update your policy with money back if deadline is reached and shipping is not yet in progress,

3) Split payment into 3 batches: 40% to validate the order, 40% when manufacturing is starting, 20% before Shipping  (applicable to order > 1.000 USD/EUR, or expecting time to deliver longer than 3 months),

4) Update your website with best practice tips. List of items to upgrade a configuration w/o impact on the warranty is a mandatory information for novice (as I am), ie:  shredlights, edge guards, etc, 

5) Train and share with your support team the right skills and documents, it is disappointing to be rerouted  to an external forum by the vendor support team w/o any value added information. 

**You are supposed to be experts on your domain, so wear the costume, as you are taking the cash.**

As we are Friday this core advises are for free, 

Sincerely, 

Fred alias Pura-Vida.

Hi RideTastic, 

What do you mean posting "range gets better?"
as you are using your board at a daily frequency from my understanding, can you detail a typical use-case, and what is your extreme (performance or distance) utilisation?
how weight (range) are you?

I think Enertion knows what it takes. 

I get the feeling some things are rushed like the new motors. Its impossible these things had prolonged betatests from several batches of prototypes when I see issues after minutes of usage. Look at the range... its less than before. revisions should improve and not get worse. Or the manufacturer is not putting out constant quality... so you replace them and hope for the best. Enertion is a small player in china.

But Enertion is or at least was not close enough. A factory visit is a visit... you need someone there 24/7. They need to have a certain margin of profit. quality and quality control suffers. 

Enertion changed suppliers and logistic partners several times. Manufacturing is hard and some bad luck is involved too. You struggle with your product, you are small, service suffers, delays... its manufacturing hell as elon calls it. Look at Jed Boards...

How come you visit a wheel manufacturer in china several times and they still screw up and deliver wobbly and cracking wheels? They produce perfect wheels for other well known brands... must be very frustrating. look at torqueboards... made in california, perfect wheels from such a small company.

Btw where is Roan?

I expect more range as the temperatures rise >20 degrees. I mostly drove around at 7-15 degrees.

For example, I had done a range test with a throttle that was almost pushed through and only managed 14km. 

Yesterday I cruised 13km in a hilly landscape through the city and had 43% battery left (not bad for many hills).

I really dont know about the outside temperature increasing the range , because a lot of energy is loss due to the heat in the hub , if such high heat build inside the hub at 7 degree , i can’t imagine what it will be at 20-25 degrees outside.... maybe it does help the battery , i really dont know

I am pretty sure that Ride Tastic was expecting range improvement in relation with outside temperature and battery efficiency that is optimum when temperature is close to 20°C.

But +50 to +100% gap (range extension) are not standard values for 15° temperature inc.

I just got back from my range test. The conditions were perfect. Very good aspahlt and 24 degrees warm. Well what can I say I have ridden very conservatine, since many cyclists and children were on the track but see for yourself. I expected at least 30km and got 20km.


**Avg. 27km/h or 16,7mph in rspec mode and range 20,39km**
 
Also always **kickpushed** to start. My Weight is 88kg.

I forget what the electrical resistance is on these and the actual kv and could figure the km but for its size it shouldn’t be getting hot or such inefficiency.   Either would show up with these numbers revealing a bad km or else if that’s good I’m guessing it’s not showing up in the copper and instead iron losses from a bad magnetic circuit.

Thats no issue. They always take down stuff when they are not happy with the quality. You can't even order normal wheels at the moment because they are waiting for the new formula wheels that should fix the cracking issues. Well thats the reason why I am waiting 10 months now for my spare wheels...

They are trying... nobody wants these boards more without issues and in the hands of their customers than enertion. Its just obvious they have serious quality issues everywhere except the unity... and thats thanks to jeff, the one new guy at enertions product development that knows what he is doing. Bara has to fix the rest of the stuff and carl has to take the blame. I really don't envy these guys.

i really like my raptor but the low range for a 12kg board..the high range has encouraged me to buy even of the heavy weight.

Yep. I had 6 of the black motors and can verify that they were way better in terms of heat and power. The new ones are way worse in comparison. It literally seems like they care less and less about quality.

If you have seen enertions china trip on youtube you saw how it goes... they got the new silver motors to their assembly team, assembled a complete board and jason was testing it behind the factory in a parking lot. Like "I guess its the same power maybe a bit more" and on they went to slap these motors on the raptors.

Does a proper betatest, QC process look like that? Nobody saw overheating, thermalthrottling and a decline in range? 14km range advertised as "up to 40km". 40km IS the theoretical value with a 430wh battery and that alone proves just how inefficient these motors are.

I really wish my replacement raptor is in good shape and I will be more than happy to report anything positive I will experience with it... but I need a board to do that.

Hi guys,

the more I read the more my dreams are moving to nightmare...
Initially my questions were dealing with delays only, then some questions about how to protect my board as enertion were unable to share some experience or best practicing topics, then it was with range and bugs with control. 
I was discovering issues reading this forum post by post, and I can resume it like this: the deeper my read is the darker my future will...

Then it was the wheels, motors and heat, and now lake of transparency...

2 options are onto the critical path:
1) I decide to continue with them, and cross my finger expecting that all the troubles with manufacturing or design are fixed now
2) I cancel the order, and request to get my money back and accept to loose 20% of my command on the board, and nothing on the spare wheels as they are not into their catalog anymore.

If they'd be tough and reliable, I will continue with them without interrogation. But this is not the reality.

I know that unlike brave will do, no Enertion staff will answer to this mail with engagements written on the stone, so riders, I need your feedback.

Thanks, 


Fred.

If i were you i would cancel the order and go the diy route or get a complete board from @e.board_solutions. 

My first diy (dual 6355, 10s4p battery and 90mm wheels) was trouble free and i didnt have to touch anything for 1000km , belts are relable if you do the adjustment right. My first DIY is still on the same belts and they have been fine for 10000km + now.
Oh and the range was 30-40km on a regular ride.  I do use enertion focboxes on all my builds, cuz they are super good and very reliable!

If money is an issue and you only want one board maybe cancelling is an option.

I stay with the enertion guys. I am following them for years and I want them to succeed. We have enough of these cheap chinese boards and I think a real board with power, real components and good service on the market does help all of us.

yes it is frustrating at the moment and no end in sight but I still believe they can turn it around. I was and will be harsh but I think it can only get better in terms of QC and Service. would I buy a raptor today? No. But somehow I want to be part of it and after almost a year of waiting I will pull through.

Hi McErono,

Usually I will take the same path than yours, as I like the guys who are minded with a startup spirit and take risks.
But in another hand I hate vendors on which I cannot trust in.
I use to manage teams with large and international projects, I can listen to and manage errors, but only one thing is unrecoverable: not tell the truth, not admit that the fault is on our side, forget to notice about risks.

Money, is not a problem, except when the guy in front of me is not honest. I will accept to pay 20 times the initial price to a lawer if I can stop and put him in jail.

Well they're not good at the moment but shit just happens, even to the biggest comapny, imagine you buy $2000 booster board and then they recall the battery packs and you can't ride it until you get a replacement(that happened).

Also they tried:

Perhaps, this is a third option.

Are TB DD embedded or hub motors or are they using pulley? Sorry I am novice in esk8, so vocabulary, brand, models, is not natural.

Sorry I do not understand charge back?

Enertion took the money from my Visa credit card in October/November. So 100% of the bill is into their bank except if they travelled to Fiji for Christmas surf session.
Few days ago as I was getting no news from them, I've requested to get the money back w/o answer from them.
They told to me that if I decide to cancel my order they will charge me to 20%.
Something like that in EU will go directly to justice as internet transaction are secured and controlled by national and European trading exchange policy.

I would not do that. I dont like the raptor deck and I want 12s. I know its strange... why do I hold on to the raptor then?

The TB DD with wheels is half the cost of a custom diy board and this is where these things belong in my opinion. But I am not telling you not doing it! Would be very interesting to see a raptor with TB DD and you could easily sell the raptor motors and trucks.

@Pura-Vida a direct drive (DD) is kind a like hub motor but the wheels are not on the motor but mounted on the outside. So they run cooler and you have the advantage of using all kinds of wheels and more comfort because the thicker urethane on them.

As 2 sets of 100mm outwheel were included into my original order and they remove them from  catalog.

My first 2.1 had several issues like the backtruck was not centered and off to one side a few milimeters, one of the motors made a loud knocking sound and was overheating bad after minutes into the ride, lots of cosmetic imperfections, scratches, griptape skewed to one side and wobbly wheels. And in january the firmware still had the thermalthrottling issues so my raptor was shockingly weak. It was just a mess so I had to RMA it.

Like Sean I see the main problems with the motors but who knows how they are now a few months later.

Personally I dont see any purpose for the crossover wheels but they do work fine on tarmac.

No they won't. They are the absolute worst wheels ever made in the history of skateboard wheels. Just look at the wear on these. These wheels are 27 days old. The rear outwheels wear so fast that the rear of the board actually lowers and because of the uneven wear it's a horrible ride. It's not like you can rotate them. Don't waste your money.

Hi @CarlCollins, nice to get the voice of someone from Enertion for the first time into one of my chained question.

I therefore remain unsatisfied as you are speaking about new batch only. please, as many owners and customers are not optimistic on your transparency, can you go deeper into your notification?

**List of questions:**
1) Did you change the formula and specification of the crossover wheels to fix the issues seen above?

2) Why did you remove crossover wheel from your catalog, while you are not doing the same when Raptors are out of stock?

3) Reading this chained messages it appears that QC are the lightest one I've never seen. Can you respond and explain how are you driving them? rather than a parabole "We are doing all the requested to ..." it is not enough to let us come back into the zone of confidence.

4) Go deeper into your notification, we are pending for months, getting faulty arguments as unique answer. We spent hundreds or thousands of bucks. It would be easy to trust back in you if you are taking the decision to share with us what's happened. 
* Perhaps you  had to switch  subcontractors for the motors, trucks, wheels... 
* Perhaps you improved your QC as the  quality was not satisfying,
* Perhaps you run some tests and  heat is under control, let us now if now motors are X°C cooler on the same run, let us know if range increase is Y% from previous series, let us know if  wheels are able to run more than YYY kms without cracking. Its important to get this level of information, as currently Enertion is a brand for out of the Boxe demonstration on youtube only, please fix this bad notoriety before it will be too late.


**Please answer to the questions and bullet points above.**

Sincerely,

Fred. Alias Pura-Vida!

My friend. These questions have been covered 3000 times here and your use of bullet points will not resolve the plethora of issues the raptor platform is experiencing, and has been experiencing for years.

It's a bad buy, that's the up and down of it. The issue is, I'm not sure if there's an equivalent "good buy" out there commercially right now either. 

Quality compromises or DIY. That's the choice here.

the raptor battery is ok, unity controller is top, deck is well... matter of taste, wheels are horrible, motors are bad. communication is top crippled by horrendous deliverytimes and delays after delays.

enertion is working on the wheels forever now but the motors are the main issue. its not just done with another design or manufacturer... hub motors are not a good idea for highpowered boards... Hummies, what else does work wth 12s/13s?

the enertion frontwheels are fine (minus wobbly wheels) the motorwheels are awful. problem is the heat of the motors going into the thane.

we will see a real direct drive from enertion in the future I bet they are working on it already. jason even claimed the torqueboards DD are essentially an old raptor 2.0 motor with a big bearing - out of the same factory.

but even if all hardware issues are resolved, I still dont like the ride of the raptor. it feels sluggish and carving is just bad with one of the backwheels in the air in every sharp turn - its just unbalanced with too narrow trucks imo.

If you dont want diy, but real support and low/medium power and range is enough, I recommend an exway x1 pro atm.

Hi @brenternet, 

The problem is that I've discovered this forum few weeks after my order, and not before, I am spending time to read posts here, and try to draw a decision tree to build/manage a plan B and reduce damages and deceptions.

Also, I do not understand how a company is able to manage its business such a bad way, they are doing the wrong technical, manufacturing and communication choices.
each of them standalone can get real damage to a business, but all 3 together is the best way to kill definitively their business. Even if they own gold nugget into their catalog (Unity),   a company  with a very bad reputation is loosing customers, missing new contracts, and loosing money with maintenance, and looking for new sub-contractor each time a new batch is going on production is a good candidate for liquidation, isn't it?

I am currently taking in consideration the DIY, and hybrid solution: I will publish certainly a specification document, and why not a request for proposal will follow as a second step.
the main objectif will not cost saving, but the right balance between, pleasure, performance, reliability, cost and efficiency (no order yet into this list)

Apples vs pears

Modern, discrete, inbuilt enclosure with fast but hot & not efficient Hub direct drive board with wobbly Chinese thane assembled by underpaid, careless Chinese sub-contractors with a Unity heart of gold. Space cell good afaik. Reports of being thrown off possibly due to remote receiver placement, safety needs to be paramount, you can’t hospitalise customers. 

Vs

Belt driven quality components(with ok but meh ESCs) on known premium thane, assembled by dedicated esk8 business owner 

I’d prefer option 2, especially if needed to commute, but can really understand wanting option (1) if only the sum of the parts matched expectations...that thane tho 

Raptor 2.2 may be the solution

[/quote]

Belt drive is going backwards for enertion and gear drive would be as big a mistake as trying to make high powered hubs.  Basically a flawed design that no amount of refining will fix.
If you buy a raptor and ride it once in awhile nice and easy and give it some stick every now and then you will love it.  You hammer the hell out of it all the time in r spec mode and you will overheat the motors.  Its a thing you can't cure no matter what kind of heat sink/ cooling device you employ.  The motors are simply too powerful for hub drives.
Gear drive would be as big a mistake right now.  Untested and not yet reliable enough to sink 100s of thousands of dollars into.  
Same motors in a direct drive configuration might be the answer.  
Massive power and they do have massive power on a direct drive set up with some labeda urethane would be the best option for the raptor 3.  No over heating, no wobbly crap wheels and fully on trend decent kit.  Lets face it the raptor 2.1 on paper is a great unit if it only lived up to its spec sheet.  Who doesn't want a pre built with a unity and 30q battery?
I've got a feeling that direct drives have been on the cards for enertion for a while now and thats why the whole torqueboards legal threats have been initiated.

Hope so.

The thing is the hubs get hot even if you're cruising. 7km in average speed of 20km/h and they reach 100°C. The silver motors are a step backwards compared to the old motors I fear. People gotten 17km max range in slow mode. Enertion was in a hurry to get those motors out. I hope they can solve this before their reputation gets damaged even further.

Thanks for all the feedback, our team of support staff and engineers work tirelessly every day to make better products and we have a proven track record for making incremental improvements and market leading products. 

We are listening to everyone carefully, however please try to be objective, Don't Comment if you don't own a raptor or have first hand experience.

Now take a deep breath & Watch the video below, there are no other direct drive hub motor Skateboards on the market that can do this, the Raptor is a beast!

However I will agree with some commentry above, raptor is not yet perfect and probably never will be, there is not a single brand of Electric Skateboard on this planet that is failure proof. They all fail, skateboards in general will always break, I've skated for 30years and broken every Skateboard I have ever owned at sometime during their lifespan.

Please take a moment and acknowledge that there is not a single person here that will claim they have an absolute bullet proof, indestructible, 100% perfectly reliable esk8. 

Fortunately we have up to 24months warranty and a global network of repair agents and 24/7 chat Support. We are also non-stop working on ways to make the products we sell better.

Our wheel factory has certainly delivered some bad batches of wheels to us over the last 2 years, yet we still have some faith as we know they are capable of producing quality wheels as they also make boosted boards wheels and we have also had good wheels come from them.

Our biggest challenge is related to testing the qualities of each batch to make sure our performance criteria is met each and every time. We are working hard to develop much more sophisticated testing procedures so we can hold the factory accountable for bad quality. 

Accountability is the key!

We also have at least two contingency plans in place, one of those plans is to revert back to Labedea in California who made our original wheels that are same as olllin and tbs. We also have a factory in Taiwan that have given us great quality samples as pictured below.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BwlHjB8hieL/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=ynmjss7d8ac9

But the real lesson here is developing bullet proof quality control procedures. We have already learned a lot and will continue to learn about wheel quality for years to come I'm sure. Recently I've been told by some industry pros that it can take 2 or 3 years to get wheel quality dialled in.... So it could be another year of hard work before I'm happy.

In summary, we will continue to make wheels and improve our processes along the way.

Please consider going back to Labeda to make all the wheels.  That's the one thing that would get me legitimately excited about the Raptor again.  They're probably the company that charges the most but the quality speaks for itself, no need to have to deal with Chinese companies that won't take you seriously because you're not a big enough player.  I've been following the progress of Raptor 2 for good while now and have recently received my 2.1 after 14 months of waiting.  I was truly disappointed when I found out that even the original wheels made by Labeda were swapped out to the new "just as good because they make wheels for Boosted" wheels that were cracking and chipping prematurely to the now fixed formula that wobbles because the wheel is not perfectly round.  How many chances are you going to give this company who puts a stain on the reputation of  the Raptor for having the best quality parts?

Did they go on the original raptor 2's?  
Only saying because the 2 raptor2's that have come across my workbench (out of warranty focbox issues) had perfect wheels with lots and lots of k's.  Both ran very well too.  I ran one round for a week before I could replicate the issue and it was a blast.  No heat problems and plenty of power.  I sincerely hope you get the QA issues under control because the product is really very good but for that.  Still think you need to move the motors in by 80 mm and the wheels out the same though :wink:

These are almost perfect circumstances for a range test - smooth and flat roads.

I am afraid its not a fault. AlanZhou did get 10miles/16km, like 27wh/km at highspeed with the raptor 2.1. Winfly on the other hand had 15wh/km on flat terrain with torqueboards DD - your raptor is consuming 24wh/km, I used 13wh/km while cruising like you but with two very steep short inclines on the TB DD. So efficency is almost twice as good :face_with_monocle: crazy...

Did you start on a full charge? Looks like 85% (don't know what voltage). Also this is about half the efficiency I get (on my custom board), but you are going much faster, and air drag increases with the square of speed.

Ahh ok, yep I can see that it's above 90% when you start. I forgot that the unity is using voltage as a proxy for % instead of a proper battery gauge. (Hopefully they will change that soon). I think if you went 20km/h and didn't keep slowing and accelerating you would get almost double the efficiency/range.

Unfortunately average speed doesn't help too much for range calculations IF the speed varies wildly. If you go 30km/h continuously you will get a lot more range than half the distance at 10km/h and half the distance at 40km/h.

There is a difference between trying to extend your range, vs checking if there is something wrong with your board. Enertion advertises "up to 40km". To get that range you need
* Smooth surface
* Constant low speed (not sure what speed is optimal)
* Light weight

It looks to me like @rideTastic has the smooth surface, but not the constant low speed, not sure how heavy they are. So it's difficult to say whether their board is normal or not for a Raptor 2.1.

I never expected 40km range. But I assumed that I would reach at least 25km (if I drive like in the video i posted above) before i bought the Raptor.

Soo how many Raptors 2.1 they had in the Car as a spare? With that riding it would be only like 10km range.

The other problem you could be running into is actual capacity used. Enertion is using battery voltage as a proxy for state of charge. Why did you stop riding? Did the board cut out? What did the battery pack voltage recover to? If you are in a cold place, the board might have gone under the low voltage threshold with 40% SOC remaining. Enertion should be able to improve this with a better battery calculation.

I stopped because the Sag became stronger and stronger and I wanted to protect my battery. I then pushed back with throttling occasionally. If I had not stopped I would have probably come 1km further.

The best procedure to check motor efficiency would be:
1) to run the test on a stadium ring, like that 50% with the wind and 50%  against the wind.
2) To run the test at constant speedyou like that it will drive exactly to the same speed andd will not get any wind effect
3) to run the test with a challenger that will stay more than 10m behind or before you, and he will use a different board.
4) To complete the test and to identify if efficiency is correlate with heat, we can do different batches to cover 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 km/h...

And the ultimate test will be: to switch raptor motors with Direct drive and run in again to check if it is the battery or the motor that drive our range capacity.

In my experience with getting Raptor parts, it's taken you guys months (up to 4 or 5) to replace things that should be in stock for warranty replacements.

This weekend is ending the first week on which I was supposed to train in Switzerland and use my so expected raptor 2.1, but a patented B2C process has rerouted my training to e-bicycle, so my dreams have lost 2 wheels and fun and... and... everything!

 After many mails, hopefully I was able to get a call with Enertion's support (@CarlCollins). 

Now I am waiting to get refunded.
I will keep forum updated until the end. As refund doesn't get any subcontractor dependency to complete I wish I were luckier than you.

Hi @CarlCollins,

Nice to get message from you.

On my side I did the job, as exchanged previously I had to go back home to check my emails and contact Amex. See bellow:

I've  joined by phone Amex assistance, they told to me that 2 options are available:
1) to continue the process,
2) to cancel definitively the assistance request w/o option to relaunch it in case of.

 As assistance cancellation option is one-way strictly, they strongly recommend to continue it til there is some doubt on your side to be able to reroute the order.

On your side, you were supposed to get information from your logistics and the way to reroute to another customer my cancelled order. Weren't you?

Please forward to me a slot on Monday to get a Skype call.  time including timezone as Switzerland and Australia are not into the same zone.

Hi @CarlCollins @barajabali,
 
I am going to email to both of you including some slots to schedule a skype meeting, 

but it would be easier, if your different time zones have been shared from the beginning as I did on my side.

There is no chance to get your localization nor a phone contact from Enertion web site. Are you from Secret Services?

After deep dives into forums, it seems that some of you are from Australia, other are perhaps European's or from North America.

Please share your time zone, for support it will be more transparent than pseudo, and wormholes as we have to face to or to go thru.

Now to come back to main subject: I do not understand how a basic task as order cancellation is requiring so much energy and discussion:

1) you have into your hand all the information to cancel and to reroute the order to another customer or distributor.
2) you have all the required bank transaction data to refund my account

==> so why subject is aging for weeks, with ping pong email, forum discussion, etc. there is no benefit from your side, and bad reputation will be the only fruit at the end.

2nd of all, as I mentioned on our first call (clearly) that refund will take up to 30 days to process. Also, I mentioned that you have to reject the parcel then we are able to re-route it. 

I don't understand what else you wanna talk about so you are ping ponging the emails.
Plus: please note we do not offer any kind of phone support thats why we haven't share any phone number (so its clearly not a secret service).
In the end, I think I already explained everything on that call but sadly you haven't understand that.

PS: AMEX still haven't taken back the dispute.

Uh... Why? Still not sure why Enertion likes to hide things. Takes away from the "transparency" the company boasts about. Don't you remember when you posted **ALL** of my personal info here on the forum? You posted my name, address, phone number, ect... You guys need a serious wake up call.

Seriously Dude? 
I think you clearly don't understand the meaning of reply to the specific person.
Did I mentioned you in that message? NO
Did I replied to any of your comment? NO
Did I indirectly mentioned you in my comment? NO
Did I ask you to reply to my comment? NO

I hope you get the point now.

Here we are talking about company's transparency not a transparency of an employee or workers personal information (which is clearly not related to the company) 
About the information you are talking about, I apologized for it more than one time and also immediately edited that out. At that time, I was new to the forum and wasn't aware of that thing.
Still you are pulling the things up from the past (almost 1 and half year) and using it like this.
Seriously dude, you need to **GROW** up :slight_smile:

Hi @CarlCollins,


Apologize, it was not a voluntary mistake from my side, it was done from my mobile.

About topic #1: Even if it is too late, I've updated the picture and remove information relative to your Id, let me know if you require the picture to be removed from forum or not for your privacy.

About topic #2: to complete your post, it is necessary to add that during our skype we acted that you'd to check with your logistic if you would be able to reroute the order or I will have to reject it. and in case I have to do something, we were pending to Logistic notification on the process, as you and me were unable to know if I'd have to contact UPS  by anticipation or reject the order when the guy will ring to my door. do you agree. You were supposed to share this information with me on Thursday Mai 2nd (5 days ago) and this action is still open...

When I've contacted your support on Enertion, on Friday PM, they told me that you should get an answer during next 4h, it was on Friday, we are Tuesday PM, so 4h are over, aren't they?

So I am trying to do my best to close definitively this thread with positive from both side.
Now if you get an answer to close w/o doubt all open threads, let do it.

Please keep in mind, this thing needs time and it will take time. I am trying as much as possible to resolve this situation.

Are you new to customer confidentiality? You're a CS rep right? I think that when you keep telling me to grow up it's a scapegoat in order to try and maintain face. If anyone needs to grow up it's you considering the facts of the matter. I'm not the one roaming the internet as a CS agent giving personal customer info out. I only brought it up because you complained that a customer posted your name in a skype conversation. Think about it.

You probely have good reasons to be mad at enertion because of your problems. 

But have they not fixed it yet? 
Or offered you a refund if you send them your board or new parts or something? 
Or whats the status of your board? 
I have hard time se that they just ignore your problem and refuse to try solve it? 

Is it not the time to stop complain on every post made by Carl or the staff on enertion? 
Im sure Carl is a great guy trying to do hes best, but it must be very hard to go to work every day and have you reply on almost everything they do on this forum? 
I think we all on the forum know what you think about them and alot knows what problems they are working on/have already, maybe its time to give them a little rest? 

I was also angry on them for some time with my raptor, but they did send me new parts and got it fixed after some time so no need to complain forever.

And how did it hold up Markus? ... You sold it :wink:

Thats the main problem at the moment. Enertion can send you as many motors as they want you gonna destroy them. The raptor is supposed to be a hardcore board but it wont survive casual riding, it lacks range a lot and we better do not speak about the wheels.

I am still hoping enertion will pull through. Its kind of mindboggling how bad things went the last two years with the raptor.

On top of the board issues there is the support side. Yeah carl and the guys do what they can.. its not their fault when wheels and replacement parts are not in stock .. like ever.. because they are well aware of the issues. Why waste shipping money for replacement parts you know gonna break again? but enertion as a company is a disappointment.

- waiting months, was told to get a raptor in october 18
- got a raptor in january..  a mess of a raptor
- RMA shipping back to enertion - no shipping refund (70dollars)
- been told getting replacement board in march as worst case scenario
- its may, still no board under my feet
- still no spare remote or wheels here, ordered in june 18
- you as a customer have to be active all the time or you wont get anything, know nothing.

Thats certainly not the customer experience anyone is expecting.

I mean on a business perspective its a total fiasko and normally a young company has no chance to survive with all these issues. Enertion needs to learn and act fast. So giving feedback, good or bad is vital.

Its obviously not all just bad luck. They are kind of in the same boat as their customers. Their suppliers are sh*t and we have kind of two issues, wheels and motors. Jason must have been near a heartattack a few times... I would have been if I was him.

I have a few boards in my basement so I can wait. Imagine a young guy, saving a shitload of money for a raptor and then going through this, my oh my... inacceptable and we have to speak about it right here!

No they haven't. It's been 2 1/2 years so no refund. They replace broken parts with more broken parts with multiple month (up to 6 months) wait times for those broken parts. 

Carl probably is a great guy. This isn't about his personality. It's about they way his company does business. Which isn't good at all. 

This isn't complaining. It's posting my experience and facts. I'm never going to rest until Jason publicly apologizes for lying and insulting me on the forum because of shit HE fucked up and I paid for. Which he will never do. Because he has an ego the size of @brenternet's penis. Which is fucking huge. ;)

@CarlCollins shut, "refused, returned to sender" 

I really don't know whats the hassle with the raptor boards cause I got everything I wanted from anywhere to switzerland so far. So you tried to send me the board from china several times without luck and now even shipped from within the EU it not working :disappointed_relieved: so strange cause the first raptor got through - hongkong - switzerland - 4 days!

I am open to cancel and refund or trying whatever. you can decide but it looks like its not meant to be.

Hi @Carlcollins, @barajabali 

According to our last exchanges: I’ve joined by phone UPS this morning to cancel/reject shipping. 

**The result is amazing:**
Unlike the roadbook you’ve shared with me, **the action is 100% on your side as the package has never been picked up in Germany. The ticket is ready, has been printed and is aging for a month into the queue, but UPS has never been triggered to pick up the package.**
**It results that ENERTION ARE the one and only one actor able to cancel/reroute or do something.**
![Screenshot_20190510-102014|230x500](upload://aLmvnvCBSNVUHSyHezsAZBrzIfs.jpeg) 

**Now it is mandatory that you:** 
1)	refund my bank account
2)	Manage order rerouting


**I won’t cancel Amex reclamation/assistance until an happy end of this issue as operation management seems to be very fuzzy.**

Hi @SeanHacker, @CarCollins,

Transparency is a proof of healthy process and procedures, I will take care to anonymise private  or confidential data, but this topic will continue to be updated with information.

On my side, next steps will be an email exchange with Amex customer relationship assistance to get their feedback on the last events.

@CarlCollins: Enertion is the owner of the UPS shipping request. so you can cancel this order without waiting it to be delivered to Germany and to be forwarded to me in a second step. 
UPS has just confirmed it  to me again (twice on the same day, each time international call, as UPS center is ilocalized n France and I am travelling to Switzerland): As they do not picked it up. The owner of the order is the only one that can update/cancel a request and this action does not require the package to be shipped and rejected.

So order to the sender that is the legal and unique owner of this operation to do what we are expecting from him: Cancel the shipping order and reroute it to another recipient.

[date=2019-05-10 time=18:42:00  timezone="Europe/Paris"]: Amex has just confirmed to me that as soon as you are going to refund my account, the dispute will close automatically with an happy end. 

So Enertion is the flag's owner for this action.
```
