Hey been doing some research between building and buying an electric skateboard lately.  Really considering the enertion raptor.  Wondering how reliable that end of September ship date is as well as any rumors that might be circling around it.  Thanks in advance.

@onloop is your best bet.
Realistically, in the past there have been times where the raptor has been delayed by quite a bit, so that's something to keep an eye out for.

I am out skating my first-batch Raptor this evening; just paused for a coffee..   All I can say is that this thing is the most fun you can have with your clothes on!!!

It took forever to arrive, and has had its share of first-batch problems.  But it's all open-source and easy to repair and improve.  It was worth the wait!

I'm pretty realistic about delays and have emailed them asking their most up to date expectations. I've been met with responses but kinda vauge. 

Jason, if you read this, any feedback would be appreciated. Enjoyed all your YouTube videos. Helped me learn a lot going down this path the last couple of months

Your timing is great as Enertion now has all the parts necessary in stock to build Raptors. Any wait times will be considerably less than previous Raptor orders. And they've hired full time customer service staff so your enquiries will be dealt with swiftly.

Ordered my Raptor August 21. Received September 8th. Minus battery, vesc and wireless controller. Put it together watching Jason's video one morning before work. It was fun and easy. Quality components so far.

That's really interesting. I ordered mine August 21 as well, but my account still says awaiting shipment and I haven't received any of the other parts that are shipped separately.

Are you in Australia? I'm located in California so that may be the cause of a bit of delay, which I totally understand.

Oh well. This post gives me hope! Can't wait!

Seems unfair that somebody who ordered a month after me would get their board first if we're both in the same country. 

At any rate, the 12 month warranty better start when I receive this thing and not when I ordered it...

Oh, what was also weird was that when I placed my order - and it's on the confirmation email I received - it said "shipping late August". Now in my account through their website it says "shipping late September". So, they changed it after I ordered. 

I'm being patient because I've been following this forum and know how most people have waited about 3 months, but it's frustrating when somebody ordered a month after me and has already had their board for a couple weeks and mine hasn't even shipped, and that the estimated shipping 'month' got quietly pushed back a month without notifying me.

Did you order a complete or just the Raptor components? As I believe the person you're referring too built it himself which obviously doesn't require the extra delay for Enertion to build/test it etc. Also they build them in batches of 20 so maybe you would have been board 21 and are included in the following build. There's also the possibility another US client cancelled their order after theirs shipped before taking receipt and Enertion diverted it to the next nearest customer to avoid shipping/taxes whatever. So there's a few scenarios that could be at play, all that's important really tho is that yours will arrive shortly. I ordered mine on the 16th July and only got it on Friday, so you seem about right on track for it to arrive imminently. I wouldn't give them too much grief over shipping, I'm sure it often doesn't insensitive them (I know it wouldn't me if I was working my ass off). Also after this previous batch had at least one Raptor with a remote connection issue it's best they have all the time they need to ensure each Raptor is fully tested and working 100% prior to shipment. I got my board but I'm now not using it till my new remote system arrives, so if they're waiting for the new remotes to arrive I wouldn't pressure them to send you one with the old (questionable) "winning" remote system. Have faith dude. Enertion rock and you'll have it no doubt very soon. I know that feeling tho trust :) How many times have you watched each Raptor YouTube video by now lol?

It's all good! That would make sense if the other dude bought parts; I bought a complete Raptor.

As you said, I would much rather continue waiting if it means they're improving the product! When I placed my order, I was prepared to wait 2-3 months. I appreciate your thoughts on the matter and totally agree with you. I was just curious what was going on and I think you nailed it - thanks man!

Looks like the Nano x is going to take a bit more time before delivery due to some last minute quality control changes and testing. I think it's a good move by Enertion. In the mean time, (just a thought) I ordered two HK GT2B from Amazon. I also ordered two Master Cho GT2B MOD from ESK8. I remembered LHB post about being careful not to have things that look like firearms in your hands to not confuse police officers. So I ordered one in orange and one in green.

Very cool. 

Since I want to use my Raptor as soon as it arrives, I'm gonna buy a cheap remote off Amazon. I've heard the GT2B works. 

[This one](https://www.amazon.com/FlySky-FS-GT2B-2-4GHz-3-Channel-Transmitter/dp/B00FS2U9BA/ref=sr_1_1?rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1475086247&sr=8-1&keywords=gt2b&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&th=1) is $27 with Amazon Prime (means I can return it when the Enertion remote shows up...). Will this FS-GT2B work with the Raptor, or should I order the other option, the FS-GT2E that comes with an FS-A3 receiver? 

Basically, does any GT2x work or does it have to be GT2B, and does one also need to purchase the receiver or just the remote?

I just recieved my raptor today. Checked the nuts and bolts over, lined up the belts a touch, Charged up the winning remote it came with and took it for a Rip. No issues with the winning remote so far, but for the maiden voyage I wore my motorcycle sportbike leathers. First e-sk8 ride, I would assume they are not delaying raptors for the new remote. I had previously ordered some abec flywheels to replace the ones that came with the raptor, because the reviews commented on how hard the stock wheels are. The ones on the board are fine! They actually seem to be  80a'ish like advertised. Perhaps there are some variations in batches of wheels.
 I am going to change the bushings out in the trucks though to suit my preferences though. Well worth the wait!

My Dual Raptor showed up today - ordered July 24th, 2016, order #5003. No remote yet. Not sure if @furryfrog purchased a Winning remote separately or if his came with his Raptor, but I don't have a remote from Enertion yet. 

Immediate criticisms without having ridden it yet (no remote): 

[Disclaimer: I'm gonna sound like an 'arsehole', but I'm just being blatantly honest]

- must paint trucks black; the blue is as hideous as I imagined from the pictures (to each they're own). it's like a baby blue. there are also like three different shades of blue/purple going on, plus black, plus silver, plus orange/red. wtf haha i don't know how people put the green wheels (yet another color) with the orange centers on this thing and think it looks good. black...just black. black is good, thanks!

- carbon deck came with some noticeable scratches and the glue job on the wires coming out of the deck is a little sloppy. the rubber housing (kinda looks like heat shrink but isn't) around those wires doesn't fit well - it's too loose, so it'll collect debry. somewhat expected since these are assembled by measly humans (not robots), though their quality control could be more strict. 
- nose/tail guards look as stupid as I imagined. personally, i think it makes more sense to have the wheels extend past the front and back of the board to act as a guard, and increase the effective wheel base, but you'd be losing the kick tail. maybe just have the front truck more forward to avoid head on collision damage without a nose guard. now that i think about it, it's kinda ridiculous to have a kick tail made out of carbon...i mean, half of what makes a kick tail cool is being able to kick the board up into your hand, but who's gonna want to damage their beautiful carbon fiber in the process? how about a replaceable plastic piece that makes contact with the ground and attaches to the tail, similar to grind plates on roller blades (do those still exist?).

- why such a long board and why such a long kick tail? again, everyone is different, but i'd prefer a board that's about 4" shorter, mainly because it makes it a lot easier to carry around by the front trucks and it'd be a little lighter. unless you're like 6'4" tall, in which case you could easily carry this board around by the front trucks without the tail hitting the ground. i love the idea of a kick tail, but this kick tail seems excessive by about 2" - it's huge. 
- speaking of carrying, I'm definitely gonna remove the ugly handle when i black out the ugly trucks. my normal fingers don't even fit in it, it's no more convenient than carrying it by the deck - though, I'd rather be able to carry it by the trucks since you don't get the grip tape all over your hands (i'm weird, it always weirds me out), and the silver handle is just another color to confuse me. having a cohesive design beyond two colors is not easy...

- all the bolts protrude on the top of the deck - none of them are flush. haven't even ridden this thing yet - no remote - but i imagine you'd be able to feel them. just doesn't seem thought out or well designed. that said, how about a quick release mechanism for the battery lid?
- deck is very high off the ground. i'm already thinking about removing one of the two risers, but it seems like the wheels will likely rub the board if i do. just standing on it, it feels really high off the ground.

- having the belt exposed (not encased) where it's lowest to the ground seems like a likely place for a tiny rock to rip it if you ride over one, which will happen. not sure why they didn't enclose at least a portion of the belts to avoid this. speaking of belts, no extras included? from what i've read, these do need to get replaced every now and then. seeing as wholesale price on these is probably a buck or two each, wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to include an extra one, maybe two? 
- a switched power button that protrudes from the top of the deck where you put your feet is just asking for trouble. 

So, haven't ridden the damn thing, but those are my initial thoughts. All of those critical remarks said, I bought this thing for performance. I didn't buy it for looks, resale value, reliability, or reputation. I liked what Jason was up to and I took a chance getting something unique and not mass production.  I'm super excited to eventually be able to ride this thing and evaluate the aspects that actually matter. Most of my gripes are aesthetic or just personal preferences - which is exactly why the DIY market is so cool! Love how Enertion is supporting that. 

Looking forward to posting some critiques on the board after I've actually ridden it and owned it for more than 8 hours! :)

The nose and tail gaurds are for shipping more than anything else I'm guessing, Hmm ya silly picking up a board that has a kick tail. I kicked mine up a few times but I have the silly guards in place still. I plan to treat this like any other skateboard I have had, my tail will get scratched. Once you put your own scratches on it everything will blend together.

It is a long board, I would prefer it to be a little shorter too, though I would not want a smaller battery. After a couple rides I am getting used to it. I move forward off the tail when cruising and otherwise have my foot on the tail mostly (I'm 5'7) I dont think the raptor would be what it is without the tail, makes accelerating so much more effortless. The wheelbase I am sure helps with stability too.

Funny, one of the first things I thought off is how high off the ground it is. Strange at first my, After riding it though you really don't need to get off of it once your on it.

I ordered extra belts when I ordered my raptor, did you check your accesory box?

Well if you mainly bought it for performance, you won't be dissapointed, I sure am not. Carving uphill alleys with slopey garage driveways made it like an edless half pipe of sorts, fun.

Glad you have your remote, lol. Yes the electronics layout is improved, I noticed it too. After a ride you should check your belt tension, may have a little new belt strech. The battery cover screws like to vibrate out, I put blue locktite on mine already.

HOLY SHIT!

Just rode it for the first time for about an hour. Blown away by the performance! Way more than I was expecting - this thing is insane!!

This board can climb the steepest hill in town - pretty sure it's 25% or more - at a speed that's almost too quick!

Winning remote dropped once in the hour I rode it. It didn't brake when i wanted it to, going about 5mph, but then started working again within a couple seconds - pretty drama free. Remote is pretty touchy; I think I'll adjust it at some point so the first 50% of the acceleration on the remote has a slower curve/acceleration rate to make it more mellow in that range. I'm sure I'll get used to it the way it is, I pretty much did in the hour I rode it. Stock, it's like a missile; just point and go. I'd like to still have that curve when I floor it, but not so easily accessible in the first half of the remote's trigger's range. I'm sure it's easy to adjust...

But yeah, blown away. That's the most fun I've had in I can't remember when. Definitely going to buy a helmet tomorrow. 

Now the biggest issue I see is everyone wanting to try it and me looking like a dick for saying 'no' because I know it will knock them on their ass. Wish there was a 'slow' mode or something for that situation or when I'm *not thinking clearly* and would like to play it safe ha

@onloop THIS THING IS AMAZING!! Wow. Just wow. 

For anybody on the fence about buying one, I've only ridden mine twice and had to wait two months to get it, but it's completely blown away my expectations. It's like a race car. 

Went out for my second ride today. Rode for probably a little over an hour. Got about 12 miles of range. I'm ~170lbs with clothes. The first ~4 miles I rode pretty slow and hit a lot of stop signs/intersections (went to buy a full face helmet), the other ~8 miles I rode about 20-27mph the entire time. As per Jason's advice, I went full speed to get better range (seems counter intuitive but I guess the motors like that RPM better). I think the Winning remote dropped at one point (pretty sure it didn't accelerate once when I asked it to) but came back almost immediately. 

I always turn off Wifi, Bluetooth, and GPS on my phone to avoid interference - for this ride I had my phone in airplane mode as I'm still learning how to use the Raptor and gain confidence in the electronics. 

But yeah, LOVE THIS THING!!

Mine took 9 weeks to receive everything and I'm located in the US. I was expecting 8-12 weeks. Worth the wait, this thing is insane. 

I wouldn't be surprised if yours arrives a lot quicker than the older orders. Then again, there are so many factors that determine how long it takes them to get you everything - mostly all out of their control - so you just need to be patient. 

Asking them only slows things down for everyone ;)

Just to give you a little more insight, I am order #5565 (full raptor dual) also ordered on August 21 and I have not received anything in California. This is to be expected though, so it's just a matter of being patient!

Update: 10/10/16: Just got a shipped email saying that my order is on its way! Super excited!
Update: 10/14/16: Delivered!

I ordered Sept 15, have received my battery and the Raptor should be shipping any day now. You should probably expect 4-6 weeks, though i dont know specifics.

I live in Colorado, but i wouldnt read too much into the battery, Jason has mentioned that the shipments have had a decent variance from the boards arriving. I wonder if they send shipping confirmation when the board is sent...
