I'm just wondering how long a single charge on the nano-x remote lasts? How long do I charge it for? And how can I tell if it's running low on charge? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

I've yet to run mine low on a full ride on a raptor one. I usually charge it when I charge the board and it charges much faster than the board does using a fast charger on the board.  I think the longest it's taken is about 10 maybe 15 minutes.

Is there any way you can tell it's fully charged? Or do you just guess ;)

When you're charging the light is red.  When its done the light turns off.  That's the only way I know of.

I'm not sure on the life but would like to know. it's at least 2 hours. It's a 400mah 1 cell battery on the inside. It took about 280mah to charge it when I got it. I'll have to check to see how much it takes to charge it after a full ride.
