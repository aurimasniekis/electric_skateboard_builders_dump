The photo doesn't work, but it might be a "[JST connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector)" but there are different pitches available

Usually those connectors are jst ph with 2mm pitch. @blasto you sure they are xh? Just checking to be sure. 

If it is then bleh since every connector on the focbox is a ph. 

On second thought it might just be xh since I think this other china bms I use is indeed a different size then my bestech bms which uses the what I consider standard ph connector. 

You could always just ask enertion 24/7 support.
