Hello

So the current Focbox unity app is pretty average, it tells you some information but it misses out on a lot of valuable information like top speed reached, average speed, wh consumed, max power used, etc. 
Basically only tells you battery voltage and current speed.

So I was curious to see if there was any possible way to connect the Unity to an e-skate app like Ackmainiac's ESC Monitor, as it is simply better. 

Anyone done this yet? is it even possible?

You can try xmatic or eskate vesc app. Might work as well. Don’t have a unity, so can’t say for sure. Metr works, they even have a special bt modul for the unity, that’s why I said that.

Old school way works.  All you need is a bluetooth module.

I use my unity with the xmatic app. Leabe BAUD rate as is in the stock settings. 115200 I believe or something like that.... but other wise yes, buy a metr pro. Thats what I have on other builds and it's the most legit module out there for stats and VESC settings and what not.
