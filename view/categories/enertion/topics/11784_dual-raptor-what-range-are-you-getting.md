Curious what range everyone is getting. 

I'm 170lbs and at full speed on a perfectly flat and paved bike path at 50 degrees F I got 7 miles before the battery was at 30%. I let the board sit for a while, it climbed from 25% to 30% after about a minute and then stayed there. 

That equates to approximately 10 miles, at best. Jason says you get the most range at top speed, so that's what I did. It's looking like almost half of the advertised 18 mile range. 

What's your experience been?

is it the dual?

Yes. It's the dual.

you dont get the nost range at top speed. max range is probably sonething you get around 18-20kph constant riding on flats!

with my single drive, the best results i had were 9Wh/km! for duals its probably 11-12Wh/km!

I was getting 15miles or 25km. Im light.  Also thats not pushing hard 100%. If your doing varied riding which i do you can get good range.  Especially getting regen going down hill.

Actually give it a full test to 0% Youll find you can always get extra out of the battery.

yeah, make a full range test on flat at about 20 km/h

I weigh 215lbs. And did 15 miles with 25% battery left.  Mostly flat. Alot of stop and go at intersections though.

I agree with @whitepony 
You not gonna get max range at full throttle with the Vesc on current control because more throttle = more amps pulled from the battery. 
To get max range you need to find the speed where your almost coasting and giving just a little throttle. 
Let's call it the glide point. 
You'll only achieve the glide point on flat ground or slight down hill. 
And riding against the wind can drastically decrease range just as riding uphill. 
Once I logged 27miles with my 10s 9ah lion pack
Going 5-10 mph on the Mission beach boardwalk

@onloop What's the best way to get maximum range?
```

## \#11 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-10-25T21:33:55.628Z Reads: 135

To travel the furthest distant. Travel at the highest average speed possible. Minimise wind resistance. Avoid steep hills. Coast down hill. Tryou to avoid stopping and starting.

Quickest customer support ever! 

I'll try this. We have amazing bike paths where you don't ever need to stop and it's very flat. I'll try to test on a day with no wind and report back.

I got 18 miles easily.  There's a lot of variables, rider weight, terrain and tarmac quality, how much you coast, do you kick push to start, flats or hills, etc.

I think kick pushing is the easiest and most effective way to save energy without much effort.

Way easier to find on single than duals .... but he is correct...also wider belts add a little more drag.  That's why I love 9mm belt single drive...since 90% of my rides are flat so I have no fear of belt slipping.

Yeah that glide point where you know you ain't stressing the motors and just giving you that extra push to keep you going at speed but not too much where your speeding up then slowing down

Yep and easy on the ramp up to speed...

Less draw, more distance

I also love 9mm belts and I keep them a little on the loose side for even less drag.

I have dual 9's and dual 12's. Don't really notice a difference between them in terms of drag. I'm a fan of having wider belts but leaving them looser. Less drag and without skipping! Speaking of 9's I broke my second 9mm belt today going uphill. 2 Belts in 3 months.

I haven't  tried wider belts. I haven't had any belts break on me either(knock on wood)

I think dual diagonal has a higher tendency to break. Both the belts I broke were on my rear wheel. My front wheel hasn't broke yet.

[/quote]

during acceleration your weight is shifting backwards, maybe that is straining the rear belt more? do the belts tend to break when accelerating or braking?

Yea I think that's it too. The rear motors probably have more stress since I accelerating slightly harder than I brake. Either way I try not to push either acceleration/deceleration much.

I've had it break once going down a hill while braking and once accelerating up a hill (today actually!). You'd expect the front one to break going down hills, but it hasn't happened so far!

So onloop is saying cruise at top speed (~26mph) the entire time for best range, and everyone else seems to be saying one should cruise at a comfortable speed that isn't drawing high amperage - let's say 12mph. Pretty different answers. I guess I'll have to test for myself and see which is correct. 

My acceleration curve is pretty nuts on my stock Dual Raptor with the Winning remote. It has good control at slow speeds, but even if you ask for like 50% power, by the time it gets to whatever speed that would be it just gives it 100% haha It's almost always trying to give full power when cruising at moderate to high speeds regardless of what I tell the remote. I'm guessing this unavoidable hard acceleration is really hurting my range. I've yet to just cruise without slowing down and accelerating, but I've never really broken 10 or 11 miles on mostly flat smooth roads and I'm 170lbs. Temperatures here have been around 50Â° F which hurts the battery a little bit, but not thaaat much. 

We'll see. I'll definitely post once I get around to conducting some controlled tests.

On my last ride I only got 6 miles, I have a feeling something is bunk with my battery.  For the first few days I would get somewhere, let the battery cool then plug it in while I would be hanging out and let it charge to 100%/ green light on the charger.  These weekend rides were no more than 4 miles and the battery would drain down around 35% and I was thinking it seemed short but I have also read that you can get a lot more out of the battery than the gauge really tells you.

On Sunday night I came back from a ride and let it cool and charge like usual and when the green light came on the gauge only read 90%.  Woke up Monday morning to see if I could give it a bump to 100% but the charger immediately went green and I couldn't get it above 90%. Still rode it to work and plugged it in there. After work is when I decided to run it dry to see what was going on and only got the 6 miles (had to push for a half mile). I have not put a voltmeter on my battery at its 90% value yet but 1/3 of advertised range is not cool.  Feels like I'm riding a really fast boosted board as I am getting the same range as they are. 

I ride full speed and conscious of extending my range by push starting etc and I live in a super flat area (my elevation gain to work is 100ft). 

Contacted support and Billy was very responsive at first but have not heard anything for the past 3 days. Been raining here in the bay so hoping to get this issue resolved once the roads dry up again @onloop

Sounds like a problem with one of the cells groups. Probably needs to be investigated.

You can investigate yourself if you have some prior knowledge for battery design. It might be a loose wire.

Otherwise need to get the board sent in for a service. Please email the support team again and we will advise your options.

Thanks
Regards
Jason.

I'm 215lbs and regularly log 12+ miles with a few hills thrown in on my dual. I'm rarely at top speed, mostly 10-15mph.

I'm about 60kg (soaking wet) and I ride my Raptor basically everyday between Hove and Brighton. It's about 5 miles round trip (just checked it on Google Earth) although there are some serious hills involved, and I ride at a fairly high speed, probably averaging 20mph+ while in traffic. Most days I arrive home with about 40% battery left in the tank. This SpaceCell is a beast!

Jason, thanks for chiming in. I will do some investigating this week and crack it open. I will have to acquire some shrink wrap to put it back together but no big deal.

A loose wire/ disconnected cell group would make some sense.  Hopefully nothing major.

Thank you again & will update once investigated.

Opened my space cell very carefully and everything looks good in there. Wires snug on all ends and looking good. 

Thanks again @onloop for the recommendation, I really do appreciate your support.
 
I have gone as far as I can safely & don't want to make this into a troubleshooting thread. I will try support again and see what steps I can take next. This board absolutely rocks & hopefully it's nothing major and can get back on the road asap!
