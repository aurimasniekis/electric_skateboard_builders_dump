Great review. However, I disagree with people insisting on including Meepo for comparison tests with performance esk8 boards on the market. Meepo is a budget board and belongs with esk8boards in the similar price range to Koowheel-Genesis, Yuneec, Acton Blinks, Atom, Lectric, etc...

Fair comment. I had one available though, and a lot of people are interested in getting one, so I figured it was worth adding it into the mix so people could get an idea of how it compares to the more premium boards, performance wise. There are people who have done 1000‚Äôs of kms on them already and they‚Äôre still going, so I think it‚Äôs a realistic alternative to a Boosted.

great write up!  i think it's the best, objective, unsponsored article on esk8s i've ever seen.  especially seeing how capable the enertion hub motors are, that's pretty impressive.

also, called it:

[quote="thisguyhere, post:5, topic:31721"]
How on earth could those thin urethane "skins" possibly be comfortable or durable?

For me this the biggest issue with hubs. Not enough wheel material outside the motor to make it viable.

What's the point of such categorization when the budget Meepo is faster in top speed than Boosted dual+.

Nice review, fair and honest. The cores not as simple though. I suspect they will have some issues with their first and probably second core design. We're constantly looking at methods to make our cores better. They are still a delicate part that can be damaged if they are not strong enough.

The raptor 2 is the top dog of power right now in the pre-made market. But things will change.

2018 will be the year of the Rocket board. With larger more powerful 21700's coming on the market, a new custom high performance BMS made specifically for use with VESC and 21700 cells, 4x new double wide and coming soon, triple wide hummie hub motors, custom cnc milled hollow core 100% Canadian maple decks, and 4x FOCBOX's.

The future is looking more powerful. I hope to show the world some more at the performance day in a week.

@adrianenertion I wonder what happened with the Raptor 2 shipments, they have been halted. Is there anywhere where I could check the status or if Enertion is updating some parts?

[/quote]

When you have wheels deforming (btw, I said this would happen 8 months ago based on their design), and axles breaking (I also mentioned this would happen 8 months ago), why would you keep shipping?

I saw this coming a mile away, but apparently, I was just trying to shred my opponents product apart so I could promote my own motors. If I wanted to be the only manufacturer with good hub motors, I would have kept my mouth shut. I tried to warn, but I was ignored.

Glad to see them stop shipping so they can make changes and try again. I still don't see a future with the 8mm axle, especially one that long, but we'll see if they find some way of pulling it off.

Axle problem was because of torque when installing the axle into the truck. New wheels with a solid inner hard plastic ring are coming any day now. 50 boards ready to ship when wheels come in. Building 50 boards a week. 

Big end of month 3 day sale on focbox, remote, 10s4p 30q battery pack, mtn wheels, 97mm wheels, replacment wheel.

Thing missing from this review, for me at least, is the temperature of the motors before and after every ride. Especially after hill climbing.

[/quote]

Will crack and fail in time... It's not this simple as hummie and I are finding out... We have 2 solutions we are working on to hopefully fix the problem for good. We know the second option will work, but it's expensive and more complicated. I would hold enertions hand and give them the solutions, but since my recommendations were ignored before, it would be on wasted breath.

Torque from installing axle in truck ?  That's not going to make an axle snap later.  Makes no sense.  If it was a lot of torque installing it would strip the aluminum threads of the hanger and even then it wouldn't make sense the axle would later snap.  The obvious answer is leverage due to the long unsupported span the length of the motor.

Good point! I didn‚Äôt think of that. You wouldn‚Äôt want to do too many of those hill climbs repeatedly that‚Äôs for sure, especially on the Evolves. Those motors were super hot!

I think he meant that the axles where not torqued  in tight enough. Which leads to loose axle which leads to break. 

IDK just doing a TLDW for the video

why would a loose axle break?


 I cant sit through a full length  film.  I lasted though the first 2 minutes and was worried about possibly sitting there any longer.   Did you see the R-spec outrunner video?  a short 10 minutes I think.    Was  it said to be the installation of the steel axle into the aluminum hanger that was done wrong? or was it said the nut on the outside was loose so the motor's connection to the blue square of aluminum was loose so that would snap the axle?  I guess Jason doesn't want to talk about it on the forum.

I think you  hit the nail on the head. He mentioned both the fact the axle was not at the correct torque when installed and that the nut on the rear axle's should be set to a certain torque. 

Video is long but I just do stuff with it on in the back-round and try to crack a joke or two in chat. Sometimes Jason can be a tad to serious. Which is good for people that care about that meticulous bullshit, you can see why most CEO don't have live Q&A especially every week.

Hey Alan,

We're hoping to resume shipping this week. V3.0 wheels are due for delivery to our assembly factory today, so once these are QC'd and installed onto the Raptors that have been pre-assembled, we will be initiating shipments again.

At this stage, we are hoping to get out 50 per week as a minimum. Once this starts to occur officially, we'll be updating shipping estimates accordingly. Our apologies that we have not updated these for a while, but we felt it pertinent to wait for shipping to resume officially before this was done.
```
