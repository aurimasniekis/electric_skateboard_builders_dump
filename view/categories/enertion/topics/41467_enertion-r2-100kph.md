While watching the esk8 awards it was mentioned that @onloop has an R2 that he cracked 100kph with.  Can't find any info on this. Would be fantastic if it could be confirmed..  anyone have any info on this or is it urban myth like Bigfoot..?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/293336823c89614e7ddf930f7a352b3cb322b8f0.jpg" width="449" height="500">

At least the R2 has been seen in the woods. It was mentioned at 44:55    https://youtu.be/cBcP9rLbmjE

Maybe with the cross over wheels it can reach somewhere is in 60-70k kph range but unless you went 12s I don't see it hitting 100kph

this is what i heard, dont quote me but

Theoretical speeds. Dude in the video said "Jason has had the R2 up to 100kph". Must be true cause I saw a video (of a guy saying it).  I know there is proof locked in a vault with the X-files...    <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/5/b56fbb595f7f303c464c0f317ffc05c59ce4cd1b.jpg" width="565" height="500">

Surely this is bollocks, its not even possible for it to be able to hit that Speed without modifications. He says you can change it in the android app, obviously Enertion has made an app that lets you change your battery voltage and motor kV while you ride, SICK

yea man its Nano technology tiny little robots rewind your motor while your riding for different kv and they can switch cells from parallel to series depending if you need more range or more power its the future!

Just got confirmation there is no R2 banging 100kph. A simple mistake by the host Jay Boston.   I was  hopeful. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/2/f278fd225b8d8a418d2923792bc712149a043713.jpg" width="502" height="500">

Not out of the woods yet. Jay says the 100kph Raptor2 is real!  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/98d5f281496b5493db03d20cc47dbd2fad35c266.jpg" width="690" height="456">.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/293336823c89614e7ddf930f7a352b3cb322b8f0.jpg" width="449" height="500">.

yeah but he also said it could be done if he changed the way he built the hubs.

Nope, it takes more than the power the Raptor 2 battery delivers to achieve 100kph. It took me 4000W to hit 49mph. The raptor 2 battery is only capable of 3000W.

@MoeStooge

How much much power were you drawing at 57mph?

```
from the Stooges data log files he was just under 4000w per esc/motor
but his voltage was pretty low, with a tune up I think he will go close to 5000w each...

3944w divided by 28.6v equals 139 amps

Nice, so about 8000W total.

He was still accelerating hard when he reached 57mph, but I think its pretty clear that nobody will be getting close to 100kph on a 3000W Raptor 2 regardless of motor KV.

Calculator it Takes approx 6hp to maintain 57mph=4474w total.

the motors could do it. Just need to shove enough voltage in there.
