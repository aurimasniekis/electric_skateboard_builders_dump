After a long grueling 13 months of waiting it's finally here the Raptor 2!

I have not ridden it yet, still charging but I did notice quite a few imperfections.
 

First here's some pics, the box comes now wrapped in white cardboard this is great cause you don't want a box sitting outside your house that says most powerful direct drive electric skateboard.

Here are some of the imperfections I found mostly deck and seal related.

I have only turned it on and spun up the motors to make sure it actually works but was not impressed it may just be that it's not charged it's at 40% or that the hubs are really quite in FOC. 

Here are some more pics of the board the trucks are super thick.

I'm off tomorrow so I will be testing it thourghly. 

As soon as it's done charging I'm going to take a quick ride around the block and give you feedback.

The raptor 2 has quite the beast of Initial  torque you should love it charge it and let us know how you feel about it. Slight imperfections are bound to happen were all humans at the end of the day the real wonder is when you beat the crap out of it from hell and back and still works like day one that's the wonder.

Well Ive been expecting it to be a torque monster we will see so far the only set up I've been to afraid to full throttle is my 12s dual 6374 with 16/36 gears on 90mm wheels it has insane torque I can't see the Raptor being that good but Im sure I'll be happy with it.

Hmm the grip thing is a design choice by Jason cause it looks nice but then that means a lack of grip when using the edges, that can be fixed easy enough, but honestly standing on the deck it feels really nice and I feel really locked in the W concave is great.  Hands down it's a way better deck than the Raptor 1 feel wise.

The full color graphics inside the box was a surprise to me, nice but it guess that cost a bit. The texture on the grip tape looks SAVAGE. 

A few small scratches are nothing to worry about as after a little usage it will look way worse. Though its not apple fresh quality. 

I'm sure after the first ride you will forget all about it. 

Waiting the ride review.

@Battosaii

These are just minor cosmetic issues, this might happen during shipment ad mostly under customs inspection because they might took the lid off to check the battery.

You can simply re-seat the seal properly and accurately.
The LCD display is good I guess, I hope you checked it by turning the board on.

Actually, Customs are very strict now, they even tear apart the NANO-X to see the battery, we experienced it during shipments of Cyber Monday orders. Apologies for that.

I rode a little last night only a few minutes and I have to say it's really smooth. The V2 deck is stiff, stiffer than my Evo deck but still the ride was smooth it felt like I was using 4 regular wheels I thought being a hub motor it would be rougher like a Koowheel but it's actually smooth.

It's not a silent board, the motors do have a slight hum when accelerating but it's nothing like 6374 on bldc. The power is there, like LHB confirmed for me after he rode my DIY, my DIY belt board out accelerates and out brakes the Raptor 2 but doesn't mean the Raptor 2 isn't fast cause it's fast it moves really well. 

After owning a Raptor 1 and now a Raptor 2 I can honestly say the Raptor 2 is a real evolution over the Raptor biggest difference for me is deck feel the Raptor 2 deck makes the CF raptor deck feel like a toy. 

I'll take more pictures and I'm gonna ride it around today so let's see what happens lol

The cosmetic wear isn't anything to worry about it is a skateboard after all.  I know it bugs me because I am very anal when it comes to building a board.  they just didnt apply either a second coat of paint/stain or they only get a light spray on layer of lacquer just take a little black spray paint on a qtip and touch it up if it bothers you.  When I put graphics I always check the edges after sanding to make sure no paint or stain came off but that is just me and how I build.

So on the App I found that it has 4 modes this is useful for when noobs want to ride, on my diy don't have any modes set up just one set up "stupid fast" and that not good when noobs want to try my board I have to be the jerk and say no :(

Wow look at those tiny bullet connectors, here it is compared to the standard size we use in DIY

not really 12 gage is good for 50amp cont and 100amp burst for dc motor so it's more than enough. I found that the most of the chart is based on ac voltage which is irrelevent

after riding both my boards today swapping back and forth during a ride with my brother im kinda mad i ever went 12s with my diy. 

As fast as the Raptor 2 is, 10s leaves me wanting more torque i dunno if its the 10s vs 12s or hub vs belt cause on my diy i feel like i have strong torque throughout the whole powerband all the way till top speed and the Raptor 2 feels very torquey at the bottom end and that torque drops fast as you pin the accelerator and pic up speed.  

I have to say it is a cool feeling to blast off from a stop my DIY cant launch from a stop like the Raptor it feels like a rocket.

Ever try running FOC on your 12s build or just straight BLDC?

ive only run BLDC havnt even run sensors cause one of my motors has sensor problems so i just run them sensorless. many people Pop their Focbox with 12s FOC and many are successful im not gona push my luck it seems like a hit or miss thing.

Id love to try the Raptor drive with 12s but i wouldnt attempt it cause they get hot enough with 10s

best thing about it are the controls its acceleration curve is silky smooth i did up the braking a little i like more aggressive brakes. maybe FOC has alot to due with that its also strange not to hear anything when accelerating. At low speed you can hear the motors make a small whine but 13+mph all you hear is the wind.

Wait, I am a little confused, why are you mad about going 12s? Because you could have more bottom end torque with the 10s (10s6p can push more amps than 12s5p?)?

Maybe I misunderstood your statement....probable..

Small update I've done some lite riding with the 97mm wheels so far no more than 5 miles but at this point there are 0 signs of wear. The real test will be the Wednesday night group ride. 

One thing I noticed the handles are way too skinny for the weight of the board it makes it very uncomfortable to hold the board with the handles  so to thicken them up a bit I wrapped both handles in 550 black paracord, it makes a huge difference now the handles are not uncomfortable.

It's a good board it's fast for a 10s system most people would be satisfied with it and the performance. 

DIY will always be better cause you make the board how you want it also there are so many options out there but it's up to the person on the end if they want to make something DIY that's better than a Raptor 2 it's possible you just need to take you time and plan the build but if you want something ready made there's nothing else that competes with it.

To what extent could u just increase amps and stay at a lower voltage n get performance as good as higher voltage ? The focbox has its limits but other escs have no problem doing huge amps low voltage.  I'm guessing the limit would be the resistance of your complete system and getting the high current w such low voltage ohms law

I have another night group ride tomorrow do you recommend me to continue  testing the 97mm or should I throw the 90s back on to see how they fare?

97s have been good so far it may have to do with the urathane being thicker or maybe it's a different formula.

Noticed after removing my wheels that the left motor can has a cross threaded screw and a stripped head, I couldn't remove the screw. The rest we're loose and I tightened them to a snug pressure not too tight.

@barajabali could this cause vibration at high speeds? I feel a strange vibration above 20mph. I'm gonna test the 90mm wheels tomorrow.and see if it's still there.

I had a go on a Raptor 2 last night, first time ever. It's just way too stiff for me. Also, pretty disappointing that they changed the adjustable baseplates to fixed angle plates.

Never had an adjustable base plate, it was a reward for reaching a certain Kickstarter goal and that was never achieved so it was shelved for another time.

My new 90mm outwheels are all dried and cracked and will probably start chunking soon. I tried the cross over wheels and they roll pretty nice but after a 7 mile ride there are major cracks in the outwheels and the front cross over wheels. They need to fix the formula soon, I can ride my board a lot cause I have many sets of wheels but for the guys with just the one set it must really suck. 

I also have had a problem with my board, when it gets hot it will not start from a stop it will just jerk and it's related to heat because I've tried to replicate the problem with low power and the board cool to the touch and it works fine so it's a heat problem. 

Hub motors get way way to hot, I run my dual 6374 build and ride hard for 18miles and my motors are barely lukewarm running 80motor amps at 12s

The x-overs will disappoint you I'm sure. There wear fast. Really fast. They are horrible. They vibrate. They crack. They suck! They are nothing but a marketing ploy to collect money in order for Enertion to afford fixing all the broken Raptor 2's out there. ;)

Here’s the comparison between some MBS All Terrains that I’ve ridden daily for 9 months VS the 2 week ridden Enertion X-Overs. 

P.S- The front wheels are only 4 months old. I forgot I changed them out. ;)

Lol. Nope. Just Trying to be as honest as possible. These wheels are shit. Actually all the wheels that Enertion has produced so far are shit. As evidenced by all the posts about cracked, chunked, horrible wheels here on this website and at the .club website, facebook, insta, ect. Not to mention my personal experiences. I thought I was being nice actually. I gave them more time then necessary and yet they still under performed by far. Really, really far actually. 

I could go on about how I know what Enertion is doing. They need $$$. It's way too obvious. But I'm tired. I just blew over a bridge with a drone that I don't know how to fly tonight on an eboard that I built two years ago that's still running (with a battery you made! Thanks dude!!!) with little to no problems at all. But I paid so much more for a production board that I was told would be perfect. I didn't expect perfection. But I also didn't expect a board that in the end that I paid almost $2,000 USD for to be broken 97% of the time owning it. Proof is in the pudding here. I've had reported after reported problems that are plain to see. Weird considering how much Enertion is into "quality" products. I had to buy two R2's in order to keep one running. That's bad dude. It's not harsh. It's shitty. ;)

P.S- Do you really think I'm being harsh @barajabali? Probably not considering what's going on. You're the only one left other than @Blasto that I truly do trust at Enertion. @JohnnyMeduse probably hates me as far as I know. But I still like/respect him regardless. Happy fucking Mother's day! :slight_smile: 

P.P.S- Here's a pic of my bully Cleo in the hopes that you don't get too mad at me @barajabali. I respect you to the end. I don't respect Enertion as a company anymore. It's nothing personal. I'm sure soon you guys will see me talking to Jason on youtube. Probably going to just one more bad decision by Enertion. CEO's shouldn't talk to the public. But we'll see. :smiley:

I mean I'd be frustrated too if I'd spent that much on a board that doesn't work and has no permanent solution timeline at all.(unless they've figured out the wheels in the last few days). I'll be honest, I showed up with mt brother and our eskates at the R2 meetup in Atlanta with Moja and bunch of others including some that drove from hours away (you're nuts @longhairedboy ). I rode the board and was really impressed as I'm a big hub/direct drive fan, and these were the most powerful hubs I'd encountered. I don't dig the deck, but everything else seemed really nice and I had kicked myself over the last 6 or so months since I didn't pull the trigger when it was available shortly for $900. I use a lot of enertion products and I respect Jason's "passion", however I believe I lucked out considering all the issues going around from even huge fans of enertion products.

I removed my lid to show a friend where the reciever is located on the raptor 2 because he was having an issue with his and I noticed the phase wires have shifted quite a bit, I remember pushing them in the first time I removed the lid but now they are like this. 

@barajabali forward this to Jason cause if these wires short out during a ride someone will get very hurt.

I don’t think that all the wheels are having issues though. Mine have been just fine so far, same with another buddy of mine. (97mm).  

Easier to post pictures when things go bad, but here’s a shot of mine after about a month of use.

I've had my raptor 2 for couple of months now and I find that riding over bumps and cracks after a long period of time is really jarring on that back foot sometimes at a high speed that hard weight in the back causes speed wobbles does anyone know if they make softer slip over hub wheels such as those green ABEC 11 for hub?  Definitely needs a softer ride in the rear
