Nei, har heller ikke pr칮vd 친 bestille et. Det burde ikke v칝re noe problem 친 f친 ett til Norge. Du kan jo altids bygge et selv da.

Eg er ogs친 fr친 Norge.

There are many build threads around this forum, check'em out. I have one, but you can take an easier approach building your first than I did. Building in Norway can be quite expensive due to the shipping and import taxes (frakt, moms og toll) and there are some completes being sold around now also. For import make sure the VAT is subtracted from the price. If the seller is unable to cut the VAT, you'll pay VAT (moms) in both the country where the seller is and in Norway on arrival. The VAT in Norway will also be larger than it should as it is based on the price included VAT from the origin country. So be aware..

For building you have quite some options. Thinking Europe you can e.g. buy from:
* Unik boards, France. https://www.unikboards.com/en/. They sell nice build kits. Last time I checked they don't export batteries to Norway.
* https://eskating.eu in Italy.
* http://www.esk8.de in Germany.
* Trampa boards in the UK, https://www.trampaboards.com
* A huge skate store in the Netherlands: https://www.sickboards.nl - they also sell completes.

For different things needed in builds:
* Kjell stores, www.kjell.com
* Biltema, http://www.biltema.no
* Clas Ohlson, http://www.clasohlson.no

For materials building the board itself I use different stores like Byggmax, Coop Obs bygg, Monter etc.

For completes you'll find BeReal in Norway: https://www.breal.no. They rebrand Onan boards.

@kbone here sorted this out for some other raptor owners in Norway. Think the battery makes it hard to send it in some parts of Norway..
