Batch 3 users only just got theirs when they ordered at end of May. Unless Enertion have managed to fully restock on all parts, yourve got at least another month by estimates. Try Enertion support. Their last update on parts was good, but they may not have all the decks as they only come on batches of 20-30 and thats if all non defective when they arrive.

Just be patient. It kills you I know, but thats the reality.

Also they still need to be made by hand then packaged up for shipping. A good sign of pending arrival is when the battery comes. The board should then be a week or so away. The whole thng is a logistical nightmare for them. Lucky Im in Aus at least.

From my order date I got mine in about 3 months.  I think it will always take them 2-3 months due to the fact they can only build a certain amount every month.

Honestly not sure but it should not because that is parts enertion has in stock and there is no building required from them.  If those take more than a week or two to ship, then that's bad service.  If I was to order the kit, I'd wait a few business days and if I see nothing then I'd contact them.  If nothing has shipped for two weeks id start thinking of refund... Cuz no one should have to wait that long for kits.

Really?....... 99% of delays are due to being out of stock.... which is normally due to some crazy logistics screw up or customs delay or some other unforseen circumstances or recently due to limitations of our suppliers...

If we have stock we generally ship next day.

I ordered first week of July, the website said they would ship in August. I wish he would only sell what he has built. My suggestion would be build as many as he can, put them for sale. then when out of complete boards say out of stock,and update people on when new ones are available. The way he's doing buisness is going to cost him loyal customers.

Enertion could probably do what you are saying, but its probably to a point that he cant keep up with orders given their staff issues again. Most of the issues I think stems from all the dramas they had with supply of parts. They have said if they dudnt have the issues they wouldnt of had so many delays.

You have to remember it does take time to build them. Even though they say in vlogg its a matter of minutes. They would still need to test it, pack it, organise logistics. They are also selling other patrs and having to admin. All takes time and currently as I know it its not full time.

Just be patient. The wait will be woth it. You have ordered one of the best eboard there is, so unfortunately that cones with having to wait. They can only manage to get 20-30 carbon decks made. There is the possibility they may go with a more readily awailable deck with timber and carbon face. That might also be a more cost effective option to offer.

It showed as in stock when I ordered (items that are not in stock are clearly marked). Was that information correct? If that is the case my shipment should already be on the way and any further hangups or delays would not be Enertion's fault. I stand by you on that point if that's the way things are going down. That is a situation that I and most any reasonable person can be satisfied with as a customer. As the Uber + kit still shows as in stock I'll assume that my order went out on the 24th.

Thanks.

Ok. So I posted about my fears of not getting my dual raptor kit before I have to move to another state, so it is only fair that I post about Enertion delivering the goods in a completely reasonable timeframe.  It seems that they are back on task as promised, and that my fears were for nothing. My shipment has cleared customs in Los Angeles and is on it's way to my living room assembly shop on Monday. Two and a half weeks for in stock items from a small operation startup company on the other side of the globe... I can live with that. @onloop, sorry for the doubts, and thanks for giving me reason to post positively about Enertion's services. This is a post that I wish I could have read before I pulled the trigger on my kit. I'm looking forward to officially joining the esk8 club. 
Cheers. (Yeah, I said cheers. It's my nod to the Aussies)

Everything seems ok so far it paired without any issues and looks good too. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/d/2dd5056f1a4a5fa50d0fca77cdcbcea4fc1c09c5.jpg" width="375" height="500">.

Seems people are okay with a 3 month delivery time - but when the website is saying 'shipping after the 30th of September' you would expect this to occur don't you think? Being told 30 - 60 days after this date is a bit rich when the date is stated on the site. It now says shipping after the 10th of Oct but I have been told 30 - 60 days so it seems they're keeping unrealistic dates to keep the sales rolling. Not great really.

My raptor order was delayed 2 months and in total took 3 months to get to me.  Back when I ordered, they said they would have new staff and would be able to ship it out quickly.  But it was delay after delay.  Unfortunately it looks like this hasn't changed even now.  They should just put a 3 month delivery time if everyone is still getting their boards 3 months after order date.  At the very least they should under promise and over deliver, NOT the other way around.

You would think so. Everyone touts the great customer service but ive been in the online retail game myself for a long time and not being honest with time frames really stresses out (nice words used) both parties... moral of the story, be accurate or ADD time to the ETA to ensure customers dont get the tom tits off the bat before they even have the product. Hope enertion are listening. All the ingredients of a good brand but this will quickly erode if this practise continues.

They told me the same about the Sept 29th shipment...but they didnt confirm which batch my order is in which is what we all really want to know. I like boosted's process of collecting payment when its about to actually ship..but its understandable that as a much smaller company that enertion needs the cashflow. Still would be nice to have an idea of when it will ship when you outlay ~$1600

Whatsup guys! First time posting here. Just bought the raptor complete. It will be my first e-board. Can't wait to get it. Seems like it takes a while (2-3 months?) to get after reading around the forums. Has it really taken that long for you guys? I only ordered on Oct. 8th. The site said next batch shipping after Oct. 10th. so I'm hoping I got lucky and will be in the next shipping. I'm order #6687. What number are you guys?

Based on what I've heard, they're on time for shipping in mid-October! So far Cloud_Gnash was order number #6147, he ordered on September 15, and his shipped yesterday. I'm expecting mine to ship either this week or next week based on this, and I'm order #6494, ordered on September 30th. Hopefully you'll get yours soon!

I got a "Partially Shipped" order update with a tracking # 2 days ago (Must be the battery?). Also received an email last night stating that they are going to "ship a few Raptors this week and the remaining ones will be completely shipped in the week after." Not bad at all considering I only made my order 10 days ago. Nice to see that it doesn't take months to get one. :smile:

Quickest support response turnaround I have had so far.
Just got back to me with a tracking number that says it's showing up by the end of the day tomorrow.
Strange I did not get a shipping notification earlier (shipped out of TX Fri) but now it feels like one-day shipping.
Hopefully will be ripping around soon.

there are a whole bunch of raptor customers who don't have the winning remote (they have steeze) who may now purchase the NANO-X at a hot price as its a VIP member deal.

My battery will get here today order #6687. I ordered the raptor on Oct. 8th. I hit them up on instagram yesterday asking about some extra parts (extra battery, belts, and fast charger) that I ordered just a few minutes ago and they told me to remind them in the new order notes about the raptor. So hopefully it will kickstart that thing my way. I've literally spent the same price as a small car for this board now. Not sure if I'm proud or embarrassed. ;)

@onloop Just noticed your post above. What remote is the raptors shipping with now. Can't seem to figure it out myself as I've seen the Winning, Steeze, and Nano being thrown around.

I noticed that. Kinda a little worried that my orders are a little screwed up though due to their confirmation emails they sent me. I have two separate orders. One is the raptor complete. And another is for an extra battery, charger, and belts. I just got an update for "partially shipped" but it contains the same exact tracking number for the battery that I already received that comes before the board. I contacted them and all they did was regurgitate the same tracking number and say they shipped it on the 24th but I received it the 21st. Hopefully they figure it out as $2,000 is kind of a lot of money to me. 

Does anyone have any experience with having two orders from enertion boards?

Pretty much the same thing happened to me. I wouldnt be concerned. I got an update from 'Partially Shipped' to 'Partially Shipped' with old tracking, before getting updated the next day or so to 'completed' when they actually shipped the Raptor. Just hold tight - you will probably have the shortest time from order to delivery of any customer so far, and i bet your second order will have no issues.

If you already have your battery and charger, charge it till the light on the charger goes green (ignore the battery display). Wear a helmet, check all the bolts/screws, adjust the bushings for your weight or riding style, and be careful with the Winning remote: it cuts out sometimes and if you're not accelerating or braking, there's no way of knowing when the remote has disconnected. 

It's possible that the remote disconnects when you're just coasting, then you ask for a little brake and it does nothing. You think you just haven't given it enough brake, so you ask for even more brake with the remote. At this point you're unknowingly asking for like 50%+ braking force and then the remote reconnects and you can get tossed off the board, because once it reconnects it responds to whatever input you've given it. For example, if the remote disconnects and you ask for 100% acceleration/braking, it won't smoothly accelerate/brake once it's reconnected; it will give 100% the moment it reconnects, which will toss you off because there's no way of knowing when it's gonna reconnect. 

If you always input acceleration/braking requests very slowly at first, you can wait till the board responds and confirm that the remote is connected before asking for any more acceleration/braking to avoid unexpected responses. I do this at almost all times, even when I'm already cruising at a decent speed, and I always do it when braking. You can also hear the motors when it's accelerating/braking, so that's another way to confirm that the Winning remote hasn't disconnected. 

That all said, the remote only cuts out for me maybe once every half hour. I'm in a pretty isolated area where there isn't a ton of interference, though.

Yep. Already got my battery and fast charger. Charged it up already. I did notice a spark when I plug the charger into the battery (hopefully that's normal). Kinda sucks that the remote cuts out like that. I live right in the middle of a huge city (Portland Oregon) so I think I may have a bunch of sketchy situations. Do you guys know of any compact remotes that work really good that I could get pretty quick? I keep seeing others say that the GT2B is the way to go but that thing is just way to big for me.

DHL tracking hasn't moved since I received it last night so I don't think I will be getting mine this week. Unless they just don't update that frequently like UPS does. :frowning:

GT2B is your best bet for a 100% reliable one you could get quickly. There are a few mod cases that members of this form make that you could get to reduce the size. @MasterCho is one of them. TBH its a little concerning that people have had issues with the Winning but since we will get a Nano-X shipped out soon, im just going to use full safety gear as well as @bucksd 's advice on using the Winning. And DHL seems to update pretty instantly, just takes a day or so for them to process the package

Yeah @Cloud_Gnash. That MasterCho one looks pretty sweet. Only wish I could find one that is already made and just ready to go. Do you know of anyone that sells them without having to do the mod?

August 21 and the parts have been trickling in little by little. The board, mounts, trucks, motors and board got here about 4-5 weeks later, battery last Friday with VESC. The controller should be here soon but I received FLATline's today. I made the mistake of ordering ONE VESC with my dual raptor. Noob mistake! So I am returning it. I have another build and have 2 arriving soon with the xt 60/5.5mm connectors already soldered on them. When I read what Jason wrote I was surprised about not needing the battery connector, but then realized my mistake on the order. If I would have ordered 2 VESCS Enertion would have installed them. It is a nice complete board. I have not been on a board for 20 years so I am going REAL slow!

Yep. I will have mine on Friday is what tracking is telling me. So It only took 20 days from order to delivery. I'm super excited for Friday to come. Scared of the remote that comes with it from everything I've read about the Winning remote. But I purchased a Mad Munkey v1 Complete (GT2b) from @FLATLINEcustoms this morning to kill the issue until we can get the nano-x. No idea when I'll get the Mad Munkey, but I wouldn't think it takes too long. 

After a bit I think I'm going to build my own board just to see what I do. :smile:

Mine came with extra screws. I believe they were in a small plastic baggy inside the box that had the remote, inside the board. 

I didn't even know mine came with a remote until somebody on here told me to look inside the board ha I just assumed I had to wait for the nano-x. So yeah, check inside the board...

The screws for my board came in the cardboard accesory box, the same box the skate tool is in. I have found teflon tape works really well for keeping the screws from working loose. I tried blue locktight to no avail. The teflon tape also stays on the screw if you need to remove it.

This probably isn't the right thread to post this in but... I just got back from a serious ride through downtown Portland where there's everything from shopping centers, banks, hotels, ect... I had no problems with the Winning remote. The board is fast as fuck, fun to ride, and everyone stopped me begging to talk about it. My twin brother was so skeptical and was embarrassed that i bought an e-board (he's way too Portland if you know what I mean) that he changed his mind right on the spot. I seriously have a form of transportation now that I never knew existed until a month ago. I love this Raptor and I'm purchasing another one for a backup next month. @onloop! I love you! Weird... I know... but this thing has seriously changed how I go about my city now. It's actually fun again!!! Thanks!!!

P.S- I got used to the stock settings of the vesc and am cruising just fine now. It only took a couple hours.

Iâve bought a boosted and boosted 2 then carbon gt

And the stupid site delivery dates are saying June buyers now are getting sorted

And I never get an email update but plenty of enertion spam

The fucken board is gona want to be good or Iâll be doing youtube clip after clip spreading the shit word on how unhappy I am and like 20 mates of mine 

And whatâs happening with this new battery?

Bet thatâs just a program upload but say itâs a different battery all just to use as an exscuse to say

Oh guys now you want the bigger bat

Itâs another 2 months

Fucken joke, I get drift trikes made in china

Went over twice had the jigs made watcher and tested 10 of them with 3 different models and engines

And that factory started pumping out 100 a month

Evolve did the same so did enertion pick a shit factory?

Iâll just say that much

It makes sense that the axle snapped if the motor was loose, constant movement back and forth could have cause it to snap over time but that's no excuse QC should be better. I'm hoping it wasn't shitty material and it was just a loose motor because that will be a pretty long delay.

I would recommend sticking to this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboards/comments/6pvsby/electric_skateboards_companies_shipping_now/

Companies shipping boards now. I would get the raptor 2 when all the growing pains are resolved.  But I don't like to give money to a company, or a crowdfunding campaign.  usually what happens is they end up holding on to it.  Rather I'd invest that money in the market and make it grow.
