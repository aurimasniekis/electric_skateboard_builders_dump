*I ran a promotion during the month of November Leading up to the launch of the new [Enertion RAPTOR Electric Skateboard][1]. The promo was a great success & so far the feedback from people about the Raptor design is very reassuring. I'd like to thank all the supporters who have put money down! You won't be disappointed & you will be riding soon!*

*For the people who have pre-ordered the Raptor, this build thread can be used for questions and keeping updated with build progress & general news! Also anyone who is interested in the Raptor can now see how it is built.*


----------


Time to start the build thread.....
-------------------------------
*Some brief history first though!*

I haven't done a build thread for a while, actually I think the last one I did was the [Hobo Board][2]

**The HOBO BOARD Specs**
1. Dual 6355 190KV R-SPEC MOTORS
2. Early SPACE Cell Prototype
3. Custom Made 50A Current limited Flier 10S ESC - (Vesc wasn't available)
4. Earthwing Superglider Deck - with high-tech shrink wrap!

What I didn't make clear in the HOBO build thread was it was basically an early RAPTOR prototype. The HOBO build was made primarily for testing the early SPACE Cell prototype.

Afterwards, I modified the HOBO board with DUAL VESC from the first ever VESC batch made. I then made this video demonstrating the performance of that build.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59d9JLXF2TI

**What I didn't have then, that I do have now is**
1. Carbon Fiber Deck
2. Compact VESC Remote Controller.
3. Lazer Cut Grip

It's been well over 12 months of developing, designing, testing and organizing factories to produce  the various RAPTOR parts! Now finally all the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*NOTE: Technically I'm still waiting on some parts so that I can complete all of the pre-ordered Raptors! YES feel free to laugh & joke... but that's the reality of running a small business doing micro scale custom manufacturing in a rapidly growing newly developing industry..* 

One word describes it "DELAYS"

**The parts I am waiting for.**
1. Lazer cut grip - in transit
2. Wireless Hand Controller - final assembly stage
3. VESC - final assembly stage
4. Extra Stock of CF Decks - Just in case i sell lots more RAPTORS

The parts listed above are about 7 days away! Considering the complexity of the product I am building I think one week of delay is acceptable.

Here is the first stage of production, I am building in batches of 20.
This should be manageable for one person to achieve in a fairly short period of time.

Awesome hardware. And nice guard dogs! I'm sure the esk8 bandits are staying out of the lab for now. 

i've got some of these mounts and motors on my bench. Gorgeous pieces. I hope @onloop doesn't get too upset when i strip the anodize off the mount clamps though.

I ordered mine already when it looked only half has good (and more expensive).

spent the last few days working on the VESC shipment had over 150 units to process. it has taken all my time so not much done with Raptor.

The vesc shipment also had the PCB for the new vesc remote, had some time to play with it, the antenna didn't get shipped. so now waiting for antenna to arrive to finalise the setup of remote.

Also, all the Batteries for raptors are in hong kong ready for dispatch, however a fedex plane caught fire and had to land, now all battery shipments worldwide are stopped... waiting for more news.

Wasn't that 3 weeks ago? The plane didn't actually catch fire, it was a faulty signal. I contacted my li-ion supplier and nothing is on hold. Are you sure your information is correct?

are they any articles about this? I googled it and found nothing.

I didn't order a raptor, but I'm excited to see how they turn out. 

@onloop, are you going to sell the vsec remote separately? Been needing a better remote than these big bulky rc car remotes.

Ive just seen news on USA today note airlines banning hoverboards on US flights. Due to recorded incidences of them lighting up.  Back in early Oct discussions by FAA about banning Lithium batteries in large quanities.  Some airlines reported as banning them.ICAO made a recomnendation. Not to hijack this thread,  but it is important.

Couldnt upload pdf into this reply. To take effect 1/4/16. Believe its still up to airlines to make the descion to instigate recomnendations.  They are putting more safety measures in place.

Cargo planes are a different story. I think you are referring to passenger planes. 

I did some investigating and there is no shipping restrictions at this time, thankfully it is business as usual. I have a shipment leaving Hong Kong today and it would have been unfortunate if it were delayed.

There is a completely different set of regulations for certified battery packers. Each carrier has a slightly different set of guidelines regarding this.

I get packages with several thousand watt hours of total capacity. The amount is even listed in the shipping notes. According to current consumer level regulation this should not be possible, the reason it is possible is because of the two different sets of regulation.

I haven't been able to ship to US or Europe for two weeks. Battery shipment to Australia no problems.

What carrier are you shipping with? are they individual cells or pre-built packs?

**THE RAPTOR COMPLETES ARE SOLD OUT**
-------------------------------------

Due to overwhelming demand, Limited time & my CF factory can't supply the CF deck fast enough - I cannot build anymore Raptors in 2015!
As I will be taking some time off in January with family also, so means I won't start building again until Feb 2016.

Thank you to everyone who has ordered during the promo period, I am working hard to ship these boards late next week.

I'll keep updating with any developments that occur.

Current issues are;
- Battery shipments from hong kong
- Remote antennas not arriving with the PCB order


**FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS A RAPTOR PRE-ORDERS ARE AVAILABLE**
I expect that supply of these boards will be very limited for the first few months of 2016 as I can only produce 10-20 CF decks every 20-30 days.

Realistically I can only build boards in batches of 20 - which takes about 1-2 weeks.

Apart from the CF Deck the only other possible stock issue that might arise, are;
 - VESC, if demand keeps outstripping supply... but this should be ok now thanks to big qty production orders
 - Battery shipments out of Hong Kong. Let's hope no more aviation issues occur.

Supply of all other components is good.

**UPDATE:**

The Raptor Completes are 95% done, certainly taking longer then anticipated, which is mostly due to having many other jobs on my list to complete whilst trying to build 25 raptors at the same time. I think It's time to employ some staff now.

The other issues has been stock flow, I ran out of CF decks & some other minor components, such as the carry handles are taking forever, mostly due to the fact I sold more completes then I expected and delivery from suppliers this time of year always slows down.

The bad news is this product is not going to be at your house before xmas. So I appologise for anyone who was praying for that to happen, I also envisioned pre-xmas delivery for the Raptor back in september when I was planning this promotion. Unfotunatley in this game of small scale manufacturing some things just are out of my control.

Please rest assured I am working hard to ensure the Raptor will be built as fast as possible, I won't be taking an extended break (except a few days at xmas with family) from work until they are built, tested, packed & shipped.

After weeks of trial & error trying to develop the best wireless remote controller to pair with the Raptor a winner has been selected. I tried as many remotes as possible in order to get the best one currently available.

**The Goals.**
**1. Compact**
**2. Reliable**
**3. Rechargeable**
**4. Cruise Control**

In the end It came down to two remotes. The Wii Style with Custom PCB was a front runner, Lots of time & money was spent trying to get the Wii style remote perfected for consumer use! However we had to give up on that due to signal problems & drop outs. It just isn't safe enough yet, more work needs to be done on that.

**Here is the winner.**

2.4ghz, Compact, Rechargeable, Cruise Control - UBER RELIABLE!

This NEW Enertion remote feels nice in the hand due to the ergonomic shape & it also has a nice silicone grip for the hot sweaty days. Controlling Speed using this feels very safe, it has custom software that has ramp-up-control that makes it hard to accidentally accelerate too-rapidly, this feature makes the ride feel much more in-control & predictable. I think Raptor owners will appreciate how good this makes the Raptor Feel. It also has Cruise Control which works really well.

Overall the size is very compact whilst still feeling comfortable in the hand.

oh and does the new remote use a standard PWM receiver or something else?

YEP, Same as backfire. Took months to track down the factory that makes it. It is actually very very good! Works very well. Super easy to setup - PLUG & PLAY.

It comes with a receiver that will be compatible with any ESC that has the usual PWM signal... Normal 3-pin servo cable etc. Connects quickly & perfectly everytime.


----------
Re: The Wii Style Remote had some firmware issues causing drop outs every 20seconds, also some other random weirdness too, I have been told Vedder has fixed it now. But honestly, it just doesn't work well enough *yet.*.. I don't really like the Wii joystick either & two people in the same space can't use it together... Overall needs some more community development, I've got some BETA kits I can sell off fairly cheap for people who want to start testing. It requires some hacking & soldering etc. Definitely not plug & play.

Out of experience an unreliable remote is very unnerving.
Also; Will there be reverse throttle maybe at a later point?

I can confirm, 100% certain that the wii style remote will NOT be used... I don't want people hurting themselves with an remote that is not ready. Eventually the Wii remote will be reliable and it could be used on the Raptor.... but for me I am very impressed with the New Enertion Remote. It feels much better in the hand and the thumbstick is a massive improvement overy the 360 degrees range of movement of the wii.

When using the wii the thumbstick feels very sloppy and lacks the precise feeling of the new Enertion remote.

Whilst you are all waiting for raptor to arrive I also suggest reading this article about [bushings.][1]

This is also a very good [article][2] about choosing the bushing, it also shows how to select bushing based on rider weight.

The Raptor comes with standard bushings which might be ok for some people, however if you weigh over 80kg & want to ride the raptor at top speed you really should customize your bushings.

My advice is do the research, buy the one you think is perfect, also buy some softer & harder. Customizing & mixing your bushings to suit your style is critical when riding at high speed.

I personally like the Venom DH eliminators for boardside of the back truck, im 95kg so normally run with 93a

Venom double barrels. Its all i use when i want to go fast. 

I have some cone/barrels on my kid's maestros and of course on my flip trick deck but my cruiser/dh longboards and eboards have double barrels because stability at speed is more important than a ridiculously tight turning radius to me.

The holes are already predrilled so you can either have the handles or not. Or mount a go pro mount on. Maybe thers a nice black cap that can be found to go over them if yiur not using them.

So delivery of the first batch of enertion raptors is still pending the arrival of the new remote controllers! FUCK I hate waiting.

> Quick Lesson to all you eager entrepreneurial eboard builders out there; when a factory tells you 10 days that actually means 30 days. 

Anyway, we have been using our time to build the next batch of raptors and trying hard to get ahead of the demand, It will be nice to have stock sitting on the shelf so that we can simply grab a deck, box it, ship it & have it arrive at the customer's house in a matter of days. 

Of course, this all really depends on demand, it could increase more than expected and we will still be behind - it's a guessing game really.

here is some footage of putting the bonus accessories onto the decks, such as the carry handle & tail guard.

NOTE: We went with the black handle, we think it looks slicker.

This is the first time I have had the MONO & DUAL Raptors Side-by-side... 

**WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER?**

***Here is a quick summary of things to consider.***
*1. The mono is much lighter!*
*2. The mono is much cheaper!*
*3. The mono has a surprisingly huge amount of power! more than I expected - the 6374 is lush*
*4. The mono has a surprisingly MUCH better "fuel economy" I haven't got a solid number yet but it's way more efficient than the dual.... maybe 40km range?*
*5. The torque output of the mono feels much more usable & human-centric than the dual drive... the dual drive is just nuts! nuts in a good way... but sometimes times you forget how much power it has and you nearly shit your pants.*
*6. If you weigh under 80KG you probably don't need dual drive.*
*7. Mono can climb hills aggressively too, especially if you weigh <80kg.*


----------
*1. If you are a bigger person like over 100kg you will need Dual Drive.*
*2. If you want to climb hills, really fucking steep hills - really fucking fast, you need a dual drive.*
*3. If you have no limit to budget and want the market leading, ball-tearing, adrenaline-pumping torque & speed output of the Dual Drive Raptor.... get the Dual Drive.*

haha my thoughts exactly! single drive for life

I might end up testing out that raptor dual though.. I'm sure riders in San Francisco or other hilly places would really appreciate it's extra power.

But hey, on the other hand maybe it's better to have all that range, and not a super crazy board! The single is probably better for people coming from Z-boards, Yuneec, etc. The power difference on the dual from those boards would probably be really crazy to get used to.

logical yes, but i really wasnt sure, i needed proof.

I only ever make judgement from my own real life experience, real data that I see from riding the way I ride. This is the first time i have ever ridden a mono drive eboard and it was a true surprise. Actually i dont think anyone has ever had two identical boards (except the motor qty) to compare side by side. Having two raptors together is a good science experiment.

So yeah, now I have the data I suppose it is logical! of course two motor uses more power than one, but i just thought maybe it wouldn't be very noticeable, maybe like 3-4%. But the space cell power gauge doesn't lie! the difference is fairly significant.

Tesla doesn't every fully charge their batteries, and they don't fully discharge them either. 

The BEST way to make the space cell last as long as possible would be to not run it totally dead, and not to charge it up to 100% every time. That said, it doesn't hurt anything if you charge it to 100% and drain it all the way.. 

It'll last 100's of cycles before the range starts decreasing (and very **slowly** when it does start to decrease), and once it does, you probably won't notice it. I've had my space cell since the pre-order batch, and ride my board all the time- I almost always charge it 100%, but rarely run it dead. I haven't noticed any performance decrease over time.

In regards to cycles of the battery, the SPACE cell is built with 18650s. I am looking at a 26650 that I have had for about a year and a half being used in my ecig. I can def tell shes getting old, but thats a year and a half of charging to 100% then draining to below 10% almost every time (wooo addictions)

so these 18650s, being of the same technology as my 26650, is going to be able to take a very similar beating. I am only using 1S in my ecig, so that plays a factor here, but still.... these 18650 batteries can really last a long time

I don't think that you are in the first batch of production boards but I'm not sure.
I'm order no. 1273 and my order status is Awaiting Shipment as well. It drives me crazy!!
Don't know if the boards are on the way or still in Enertion Headquarter known as Jasons/Onloops garage. 
Something went wrong for sure. First option is that something is not working with the tracking and the status (which I hope) or for some reasons he wasn't able to send them :frowning:
Anyway, I want the best possible product and if Onloop had to fix something... it is what it is.
I bet he's not happy as well to sit on the first batch for so long. (Remember that he planned to send them late November! But I'm okay with waiting when he improves the product.)

I also have not yet received a tracking number or any info.  I sent a message to Jason yesterday, but haven't yet heard back.  I'll post anything I find out.  Given his track record, I assume he ran into an issue (i.e. technical, with the remotes; not enough hours in the week to get everything packed; etc.).  Like Tarzan, I'd rather the time be spent to work out these issues, but waiting sure is hard sometimes!  :)

... Doing the Final QC & Packing took forever! When aiming for perfection everything takes longer.

tracking numbers will arrive for most raptor customers today/tomorrow. If you don't get tracking today your order is likely still being packed & is due to ship at end of this week. 

If you don't get any tracking email at all by the end of the week its because you are in the 2ND batch.
2nd batch is ahead of schedule and may ship before the original estimated completion date.

My order number is 1597, and I'm in the first batch.  I literally just received my tracking number yesterday.  In that email he said he is **still** packing and shipping.  Therefore, in my opinion it seems entirely possible yours in the first batch and that you just haven't received your info yet.

Also, I think it's important to keep in mind that order numbers most likely reflect all orders placed - not just those for Raptors (Enertion sells a lot of things!).  Assuming that's so- and I think it's EXTREMELY likely - there is no way for us as customers to know how many Raptor orders exist within a given range or order numbers.

Hey Raptor.. 

Nice User Name, 

As i said we have started shipping the first batch, there are some that aren't packed yet, some didn't pass the Final QC, so they got held back. This was due to Some of the CF decks being slightly damaged in transit in the last batch we got from our factory. There is another batch of CF decks already in transit now, it really sucks to have to rebuild the decks but i doubt any raptor customers would be impressed with the decks if they arrive with damage. So i had to hold them back.

I know this has been an extremely long process... your patience has been immense! 

All the raptors are being sent out based on earliest date of order first. Yours will ship soon.

Onloop,

I'm very excited to get my Raptor, but greatly appreciate the QC. Only thing worse than waiting for a new obsession, is to have the object of obsession arrive broken. 

Actually have a question about demand for the Raptors...not asking you for the exact number ordered, but I am curious to know if the demand met or exceeded your expectations?

What Enertion are trying to archieve is the best eboard you can get at the moment.  Its the board that Boosted owners will upgrade to when their bored with seeing other riders with the same Boosted.  The bonus for us is were helping and seeing an Aussie Company take them on and in fact are the benchmark.  And you have the ability to make your own with their help.  👍

I received my Raptor dual a few minutes ago. I went ahead and made a (pretty crappy) unboxing [video][1] seeing as how there isn't one here, yet. (It might still be processing.) I made this with my phone. My phone kept overheating while trying to shoot 4K, so it's pieced together from a few videos. I guess I should have tried in 1080P. I apologize for the lack of production quality and whatnot. Hopefully this video can wet your appetites until someone else does a better job. Hopefully that happens quickly...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGOqb_eZS0


I have some questions for others who have or will soon have their Raptors. What package did you receive your chargers in, was it the box with the S.P.A.C.E cell battery or the board itself? If you ordered the fast charger (at a discount) did that replace the normal charger? If you received both chargers, which package did each come in? If the fast charger replaces the normal charger is it possible to buy a normal charger somewhere? It seems the normal charger is more compact and portable than the fast charger. Is that correct? I have seen @longhairedboy's S.P.A.C.E  cell unboxing (great video!) and it seems the battery came with a normal charger in the box. It also seemed that the included cable was incorrect for his region. Have Raptor's been shipping with the correct cables for their region? Do that fast charger and normal charger use the same cable?

Did your battery come charged? If so, did you simply press the power button to see the charge level on the LCD? Does anyone know specifically how the charging port cap is intended to be used? It seems that it might need to simple be pressed between the top cover and the battery to remain in place during use. Is this correct? 

I've seen the video about charging the remote. Are there any other instructions for it's use? Will it need to be paired with the board? If so, how is that done. If not, is there any way that it could become unpaired in the future? Do the buttons on the end of the remote (labeled A&B)  have, or do they allow for, any additional function?

Lastly, if that battery won't power on is there anyway to "jump-start" it with other charges I might have access to. I have quite a few chargers lying around (for single or dual cell 18650 flashlights, and) for various things. I also have a friendly neighbor who is into RC cars and planes. If it is possible to "jump-start" or charge the battery with something other than the Enertion chargers, If so, what should I look for in terms of specifications and connection type?  Maybe after a "jump-start" I get enough power to turn it on and throw it on a treadmill for some re-gen braking???

Hello I try to answer some of your questions even if I´m a noob.
In my case the space cell came with the charger included and pre charged. I don't want to scare you but when your Space cell isn't able to power on you could have a faulty one. I have heard from a guy in this forum who had a faulty switch and the battery wasn't able to stay on. Maybe you can press the button for some time and see if it powers on.
When it doesn't power on something is damaged and you have to troubleshoot. The space cell should always be able to power on even when the display shows 0% the pack still has 36 volt left. What I mean is that the display should work everytime. Btw. Have you checked the fuse? 
The fast charger is bigger.
An alternative charger should have 48 Volt and some amps (more is better but max. 5A I think). If you know somebody with an e-bike maybe he can help you.
I think the power cord is always the same (maybe china) but easy to replace. Just grab a old notebook charger and unplug the cable from the brick.
Even if I like the treadmill idea I don't think it'll work because your circuit (motor, esc, space cell) looks like its not closed.
I wish you luck and hope its just a broken fuse so you can ride later.
```

Thanks for the information. I appreciate it. I knew I had a problem, not having a charger. I didn't know my battery might be so messed up. I'm headed out the door in a few minutes, but I will hold the button down for some length later and report the results. I'm hoping to Skype with @onloop later. I'm sure we will get it all worked out. I wish I was riding today... I'm sure the wait will be worth it though.

Do you have both chargers? Did both come with your battery? Did I understand correctly that they both come with the wrong cable (for Switzerland) but use the same one?

Again, thank you very much for the information.

I only have the SLOW charger so I can't answer that. But I think both come with the wrong cable.
I know that Howser lives in Swiss too maybe you can visit him for a charge or borrow the slow charger.
You should check the fuse.
Fingers crossed 😉
I'm happy that I could help.
Edit: The fuse doesn't matter while charging.

I received a charger with my battery, but I have no idea which one it is.  I ordered the fast charger, and I assumed it was in addition to the slow charger, so what arrived with the battery could be either one (my intent was to have 1 at work and 1 at home).  My battery did arrive almost completely charged (92%).  I was able to charge it to 100% using the charger that came with.

the unpacking video i did was on a space cell with the "slow" charger. I'm not really sure why they call it the "slow" charger, its still faster than my outboard 6S "fast charger", but i guess its slower than the "fast charger" for the space cell. My board is always charged by the time i'm ready to ride it again. it never takes more than 2.5 hours, and after riding for an hour and half, i'm usually the one that's not ready to ride again yet.

I'm glad to hear I wasn't the only one expecting both the fast *and normal* charges when adding on the fast charger. Does your charger have a fan built into it? Is it built from plastic or metal? My understanding is the normal charger is fan-less and made of plastic while the fast charger has a fan and is made of metal. There are a couple of unboxing videos on YouTube that show the battery arriving with the normal charger. I assume you haven't received your raptor yet. When you do, if it hasn't already been made clear here, would you mind letting us know if the fast charger came with your Raptor?

The charger I received with my battery is definitely metal and definitely has a fan.  I think I saw one battery unboxing video, but I don't recall seeing the charger, so hence my confusion.  Sounds like I have the fast charger.  If the other charger does not ship with my board I guess I'll need to get one.

@Tarzan FYI I have held the button down now for exactly 5 minutes. I seemed like quite a long time. The LCD display never came on. The button seems to have two positions. I'm feel like the position that leaves it stuck in and slightly more depressed is the "on" position, and the position that leaves it looking more flush with the battery in the "off" position. Is that correct? It is kind of hard to tell from the videos I've seen.

Edit: I know you said it doesn't matter, just FYI, my fuse is fully intact with no signs of damage.

Hi Thom,

I am really glad the raptor arrived safely. Nice video too! It's so cool to see someone unpack something that took months and months of work to produce.

Its VERY odd that you didn't get a charger in the box.... Every space cell comes with a charger, if you paid to get a fast charger you get one that is made with aluminium and has a fan. But you should only get one charger never two because you paid an upgrade fee.

Did the box look opened at all before you got it? I doubt customs would remove an item without notifying you first... but who knows what customs get up to behind the scenes.

Anyway ill ship you a fast charger express today. I probably don't have a EURO power cable to send though. So you might be able to get one from another appliance for the short term.

In terms of the battery not turning on, it might just want to be plugged in & charged. But otherwise it is probably a fault. I had one other customer with the exact same issue. Would not turn on out of the box. It terms of resolving this issue i need some time. My battery factory is in china and they are on the new years holiday now. Probably in a week i can get some answers about the battery issues.

Do not plug in any other charger.

If i didn't answer  all your questions please email me support@enertionboards.com

I will be discussing the wrong cable problem with my factory... this has only started happening recently.. they never use to make this mistake. the last batch all came with Australian ones... not really good enough!

If you buy the correct one we will credit you.

I'm glad to hear I wasn't the only one expecting both the fast and normal charges
[/quote]

If you paid a fee of $78, this upgrades from the standard charger to the fast charger.

However if you pay $129 separately for the fast charger then you get two of them.

Perhaps the website is a bit misleading, ill see if i can change the wording to make it clearer.

OK. I'm glad it arrived safely too. (I plan to post in another thread about it arriving, shortly.) I will not use any other charger. I will wait to do anything until the new charger arrives. When it arrives, unless directed by you to do otherwise, I will plug it in and attempt to charge the battery and report the results to you. 

My battery shipping box didn't seem notably tampered with. I didn't realize it was my S.P.A.C.E cell battery before I opened it as no one had yet posted information about them having arrived yet. Also, if I remember correctly it was shipped from Austria (right next door) and I expected it to be shipped from Australia. Anyhow, there was no information indicating a customs seizure or even inspection. I remember the box looking a bit rough, but not notably damaged or re-taped. If I had noticed anything odd, I think I would remember. That said, I did think it was strange that there wasn't a charger when the videos I had seen online showed the battery coming with a charger. At that time I decided that you said batteries (not charges specifically) were being shipped separately so a charger was likely to arrive with the Raptor itself, later. 

I honestly thought I would be getting 2 chargers in total, both the normal and the fast. I was certian at least one of these would be in my Raptor box when nothing arrived with my battery. You now say I "should only get one charger never two because you paid an upgrade fee." My order said "Buy & Save 64% Now Only: 4 Spare Belts - Was $67.85 Now $23.95, Buy & Save 40% Now Only: FAST CHARGER - Was $129 Now $78" This reflects the same thing that is currently shown on your website. It does not say upgrade or "upgrade fee" anywhere. It does say "Set & Forget 3 hour rapid-safe charger" in the product description. "Was $129 Now $78" dosn't imply an upgrade fee for normal to fast charger it implies a discount on a fast charger.  I'm certain I wasn't the only one thinking this as indicated by @Xusia and possibly @RaptorCustomer

 I have some questions that are specific to me alone, for those I will email you. I have other question that could potentially benefit others too, so I will ask them here.

[quote="thomwithah, post:174, topic:619"]
I've seen the video about charging the remote. Are there any other instructions for it's use? Will it need to be paired with the board? If so, how is that done. If not, is there any way that it could become unpaired in the future? Do the buttons on the end of the remote (labeled A&B)  have, or do they allow for, any additional function?
[/quote]

[quote="thomwithah, post:174, topic:619"]
Does anyone know specifically how the charging port cap is intended to be used? It seems that it might need to simple be pressed between the top cover and the battery to remain in place during use. Is this correct?
[/quote]

In the event that you aren't willing to provide the normal charger and the fast charger are you willing to sell the normal charger? The difference between usual fast charger price of $129 and the price I paid is $51. You where offering the board at a 10% discount at the time. $51 less 10% is $45.90. That amount ($45.90) would have been the amount I would have paid for the normal charger in you "upgrade fee" scenario, right? Maybe not, maybe its just the $51. In either case, would you be willing to sell the normal charger to me and other Raptor owners who didn't understand they paid an "upgrade fee" (and not for a discounted fast charger) for $51, $45.90, or another lesser amount? I think that would be reasonable all things considered. As it stands I have no way to get a normal charger other than buying another complete raptor. I would really like to have the smaller and lighter normal charger for transport when needed.

The board arrived yesterday and after I ripped it out of the package, threw the battery in as quick as possible and rushed out the door to test it out I am happy to say it works perfectly! I was so impressed by the speed, power, and the durable feeling it has. I've previously owned a Yuneec and ridden a metroboard, they aren't even comparable or on the same level! I would say this product even beats out a Boosted board from what my friend tells me about it (fast and good design, but low range). Doesn't seem like there's anything this durable, fast, and long lasting out on the market. In one day probably less than 10 miles of riding I got 3 compliments and Whoa what is that?!s. California just legalized electric skateboards and this product could kill the competition, especially in LA/SF. Much love for the great product and all the upgrades like the elegant/simple controller, the handle, and the scratch pad on the tail. Got a better product than I expected and I expected the best. Thanks again Enertion is the shit, keep up the great work!

It didn't work well for many reasons, throttle sticking down, throttle none responsive, unexpected accelerating, delayed response. No/dropped connection & no ability to operate two units at the same time.

@mostwanted just order one. Mine is scheduled to arrive today. I ordered months ago during the "IPO" phase. You should be able to get it in a lot less time now that Jason has a lot of the production details worked out. 

Only thing you will miss out on if you do not place your order is the opportunity to have probably the best eSk8 board out there. I have ridden several and so far BBD+ is my favorite because of its performance and relatively light weight, Range has been improved but only by voiding my warranty and piggybacking another 12 cell pack to the one that is there already. That may change by tomorrow.

Hey @MonsterCoatings have you received your SPACE Cell?  I ask because my Raptor is also arriving today (whoopee!!!), but I haven't received the battery.  I tried emailing @onloop a few times for the tracking number on that, but I think he's been too busy to keep up with email.  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Thanks - enjoy your new baby!

@fredx, I got my space cell about 2 weeks ago and it is fully charged as of yesterday when I got my tracking update that it is guaranteed to arrive by end of the day today.
I was hoping to have the board right after I got my SPACE cell as I was heading to a trade show in Vegas the first week of February but with the early production learning curve kind of glad I took the BBD+ even though I was charging it more often than I care to admit (left second battery home, found out after that I could have taken it as a spare in a battery safe bag). My plans were to use the BBD+ in place of Lyft & Uber service. Rain first two days brought that idea to a halt. Used it the 3rd day but on the morning of the fourth day my remote just died. Boosted sent out a new remote promptly after submitting a quick video that morning of my remote being DOA. But it arrived via free priority mail (not using my FedEx account as requested, but costing me an additional $80+ in Lyft rides waiting for priority mail to arrive) just a day and a half before my departure. 

SO TAKE NOTE GROUP ALL manufacturers have issues with their equipment.

Give Jason enough time and I fear for all the other companies out there. Rest assured improvements will be continuously be made and this combination really is one of the best out there. IMO of course.

Hi FredX.

what was the expected delivery date of your raptor when you ordered it?

I know some raptors were not due until end of FEB, but we managed to get them built quicker than expected, but due to the china new year holiday the SPACE Cells didn't get sent out on the same schedule. 

So I suggest you make use of this [sheet][1] and make note for me that you are waiting on battery

Thanks, @onloop - I think I was around the end of the first group, not in the after-February group.  I just made an entry in the spreadsheet.  My board is now here, looking beautiful.  I can't wait to get it dirty! :stuck_out_tongue:

Got mine last night! Due to Snow/Sleet/Rain street riding will have to wait.
I can say I tested it out and works fine crazy powerful tried to hold a wheel to feel torque and got a friction burn. I did loose remote connection when holding the remote above my head (about 2.5M above the board).

I'm going to  local computer supply to see if I can PU 90 degree adapter before I hack up a micro USB so I can connect to tweak the VESC like @Xusia and others have posted. Having ridden a BBD+ for a while their controls there seem to have a longer throw with smoother ramp up in acceleration depending on what mode you are in. I would like to have the remote have more gradual acceleration. 

 I may have to save several configurations (Student/Eco/Cruise/Sport/Race) modes so I can be able to share the Raptor with the young ones in the family. I would love to see a multi mode availability in the VESC with the ability to change it in the controller like the BBD+.

Another thing I love about this board is that you can push it without power and there's very little friction. I was riding around just to see how quick I could push if I ever take it past the battery limits and I was very surprised to see that I could push just as quick as a short board and probably 90% as fast as a long board. I think the only electric board that can make that claim is the one where the motor is built into the wheel and that thing is crazy expensive for being an inferior product. 

So impressed by the product! I used to own a crappy Yuneec and my friend has a boosted, but now hes all jealous cause I can smoke him and still go for longer at about the same price. Keep up the great work, you're light years ahead of the industry!!

I gotta say, I was a bit skeptical on the Raptors board shape...just wasn't sure how well Onloop's intentions and design would translate to a carbon fiber board. However, after pushing it up (no battery yet) and down my street a few times I'm surprised how good it feels. I'm curious if anyone has noticed greater foot/leg fatigue with the CF compared to a wood or composite board over say ten miles...?
