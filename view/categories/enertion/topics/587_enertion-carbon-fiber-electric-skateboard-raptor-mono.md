For anyone who doesn't have hills to climb, this is a very good option.

It will use the NEW Enertion R-SPEC "BIGBOY" 63mm Diameter 72mm Long 190kv Motor + 12mm Wide Belts - It will haul arse!

> With the NEW R-SPEC 6372 Combined with a 12mm Wide Belt (which offers 33% increase in torque transfer) a Mono Drive is now only a 17% reduction in Max Torque Transfer when compared to a Dual Drive.

will these 12mm belts be sold alone as well? Are they something that will start coming with single drive kits (but not dual of course), or simply be an "upgrade" or add on item?

Eventually, I might sell them separately. But they are only useful for people who have 12mm wide pulleys though, so initially they will just come in my single motor mount kits.

All single motor mount kits will be 12mm wide belts now.

90% of my customer are not in Australia.... So I found that advertising my prices in AUD was very confusing for most of my customers. Most People look at a price and automatically assume it is in the currency of the country they are from.

My website should detect your country based on IP and default to the correct currency.

I have special names for all my other products, so from now these electric skateboards I make with this carbon fiber deck are now known as RAPTOR. This one is RAPTOR MONO because it has one motor, the dual drive is RAPTOR DUAL

Looks excellent @onloop! we'd love to get more detail on the transmitter. Will it be available separately? Is this the new(ish) design from Vedder's that replaces th nunchuck pcb?

So this Rapter Mono cant go up hills? really? I assumed the bigger motor would compensate. Also, when i purchased the Rapter mono, the description read "enough torque to go up any hill"...hopefully it wasnt a typo :smile:

[/quote]

it can, just not as well as the dual motor raptor. 

It's single motor has a length of 72mm, while the dual motors each are 55mm in length. so 72 vs 110 in terms of overall motor length; and more length/diameter = more torque

With a 6374 motor on 10s you should get you up most hills, i run a 6374 on 6s and it performs surprisingly well.

@Nasty I use a 6364 with 8s and I can climb every hill I've encountered, so far. Rider weight is can impact this, but overall I think you'll be happy!

Im 6'7 and 220 lbs, i can hit 20mph on flat ground using 6s, like i said hills don't bother it really even with my fat ass on it.

I'm in the process of building a dual rear board, im looking forward to seeing how it compares to a single drive, so far the only downside i've found with a single drive is you can feel the torque through the one wheel when accelerating and braking, 10s single was really twitchy lol which is why i'm going dual rear.

Bit of a noob question, but what is 6s and 10s?

## \#25 Posted by: jakeyb2525 Posted at: 2015-12-13T23:36:22.837Z Reads: 127

```
In short a 6s battery is 22.2 volts and 10s battery is 37v....more volts =  more power for climbing and a higher top speed :+1:

What Jakey said. Also, 6s means the pack has 6 cells. Each cell has 3.7v. 3.7x6 = 22.2v
10s means the pack has 10 cells. Each cell has 3.7v. 3.7x10 = 37v

On this post it says the price for a full board is around 1150$ USD But on the website it shows a price around 1500$ USD. Which is correct?
