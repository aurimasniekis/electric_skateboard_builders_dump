Hi All,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I wanted to start this new thread to communally discuss the next batch of raptors that are coming out. I want to use this as a platform to round up all the information that has been posted on different threads about the expectations for the raptor Such as shipping dates, added features, etc.

Here is what I've found through previous threads as well as pms with @onloop:

Added features:

 - Pure carbon fiber lids have been replaced with Fiberglass lids. They have the same carbon fiber pattern
 - VESC setting modifications:
- custom ppm settings 
- soft limit set in place to prevent unplanned shutdown from high current draw on a low battery
- potential modifications to motor current
- potential modification to brake strength
 - Better QA on bolts
- cause: first batch had some liquid preventing tight bolting on the thread locker
 - Push button replaced with toggle switch on battery
 - Injection molded wheel pulley (thanks, @Adam0311)
 - Foam gasket to reduce vibration (thanks, @onloop)
 - 6 screws to hold lid down (thanks, @onloop) 

Eventual improvements:

 - Phone app for changing VESC settings w/ presets
- seems to be underway through @jacobbloy (potentially independent work but metes same end goal)
 - IP68 electronics enclosure
 - Battery option w/ 33% greater capacity
- solved (?) with new space cell pro 4 batteries

Questions left to be determined

 - Expected ship date for next batch
- CF decks didn't arrive until around April 1st, 2016
- "Nearly all the outstanding orders will ship this month, there is a chance some of the very recent orders won't have a vesc to go inside them until the next VESC batch arrives" - @onloop  
 - what order #s will be included in next batch?

Updates suggested by current Raptor owners:

 - Shorter bolts for enclosure to reduce time spent screwing/unscrewing

Shipping Plan:

* Orders <b>before February 27th</b>:
- Shipment should be getting out the week of <b>April 17-April 23</b>. My order feel in this group but has not shipped yet. 
- <b>On February 27th</b>: Some will ship the week of <b>April 17- April 23</b>, some <b>by May 4th</b>
- <b>After March 13th</b>: Waiting on VESCs, could be about <b>4 weeks</b>, still unclear.

Status of raptors (as per vlog post on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rb1-v4s0E)):

* 30 raptor decks in house, construction has begun
- another 10 decks should be coming in next week ( week of April 17, 2016 )
- Wheels came in mid may

Status of raptors as of April 20th (as per post on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ues97QGzYRU)

* Shipment dates were clarified (see above).

<b>As of May 11th, Shipments have begun for the next batch.</b>
<b>As of May 23rd, VESCs have started coming in to be completed. Shipments for orders that need VESCs will shortly resume</b>
```

Nice summary. I think you can add injection molded wheel pulley to the list of upgrades. As a current raptor owner I wouldn't mind more vibration dampening...not sure if it's possible given deck material and structure, but it'd be nice.

1. The next batch will have a foam gasket around the lid to help reduce noise/dampen noise.
2. The following Batch will have only 6 screws for holding lid

Nice, keep this updated.  Patiently waiting for my raptor dual.  I hope it's worth the $1700 something USD that it was!  Got hit with an international fee from CC company unexpectedly.  Did you ever find out what order numbers will be shipping in the next batch (the 3rd batch?), and which ones in the following batch (4th batch?).

Update: According to the Enertion [webiste](http://www.enertionboards.com/complete-electric-skateboard/raptor-dual-motor-electric-skateboard/), apparently the next batch is shipping out late May? I'm not sure if this refers to the batch that have already been ordered for a while or not.

That is very unfortunate.  So which customers' orders will be delayed?  @onloop will you be informing the customers whose orders will be delayed?

I was really hoping for an end of April shipping date because I only get like 4 months of rideable weather where I live.

```

every single raptor customer that doesn't have their order yet is now delayed.. its a first in best-dressed system... so if the people at the front of the queue don't get their raptors the people behind them don't get them either.

Fortunately, i didn't just order 10 decks, I had 60 of them on order...

It took 30 days to make the first 10 instead of just 10 days as I was promised
And to make matters worse from those 10 I get only that 5 are usable.

But I have another 20 due next week... let's hope they don't get damaged

so all up it's maybe a delay of one week.

The problem now is VESC's - that could be 4 weeks. I'll be sure to document the entire process.

Wow, that sucks hard. Such beautiful decks too. What do they even do with those damaged decks when you send them back? Such a waste of time, sanity and resources all from a lack of a little extra packing material and attention to detail. :rage:

Maybe offering a wood version wouldn't be a bad option, especially for a couple hundred dollars less. Personally, I really like your integrated deck design (and kick tail), but I would be afraid of damaging the carbon fiber at some point. I just have too many butterfinger moments, and one slip on the nose or tail, well, not good. This is why I can't have nice things. :smile:

If you were to duplicate your deck design in wood with a significantly lower price point, it might open up a new market segment for your decks and completes. But I'm sure I'm just preaching to the choir. Just my 2 cents. 

Hope you get this all sorted out soon!

Carbon fiber decks are actually pretty tough. I've accidentally throttled the nose into a couple curbs and one brick wall because I'm too stupid to turn off the remote while digging through my backpack or taking off my helmet...barely any dent at all. Overall, seems to hold up better than my wood decks.

@claudiofiore88,  Referring to an above post, Onloop states that most soon-to-be raptors <b>already</b> have VESCs reserved for them, unless that's been changed...

The main reason I made this topic was to add transparency to the shipments of the decks. I understand that delays happen, but what makes me anxious is waiting on a product I'm really looking forward to and not knowing when it's coming or why it hasn't been shipped, especially because the e-boarding community has purportedly experienced that once already(through Marbel). 

@onloop, I appreciate the feedback- based of of that it sounds like the first set of boards will ship in the first week of May?

@treeme I get the whole anxious thing.  My credit card has already been charged a whole lot of money and I have no clue when my board will be here.  I know @onloop is doing his best though.  It just sucks waiting specially when you live in a state with horrible weather that you can't ride in most of the year, It just started being nice outside and before I know it it will be winter again.  I really really hope I get my board asap.  I wonder if he can put me first in line if pay extra?

A bidding war for first in line is a slippery slope, though you might be able to convince someone else in line to trade spots. I'm definitely not going to trade spots though, haha!

Hey @Photorph

sorry mate I can't really let you jump in front of people, some customers have been waiting since feb.

If your not happy to wait maybe I can give you a refund and you can re-order another time? Once the vesc's are made & the carbon deck supply issues are sorted these raptors will be on a steady production cycle...

Let me know.

@onloop, if can get the board in May I won't need a refund.  I ordered it early April, so that's like 2 months.  If you don't think that is possible, then I think I likely may have to go for a refund until the raptor is in steady supply.  I just don't want a lot of money to be held up.  

Also will the international fee I was charged be refunded?  

My order number is 2782, you can refund if you don't think I'll have it in May.  I'll send this to you via the enertion support email as well.  Thanks.

there is a very good chance of it happening.... but the sad truth is anything can happen....

my shed could burn down, the ocean could swallow our house....

All i can say is you will get your Raptor ASAP... 

Just waiting on VESC...


* if you are super desperate.... i can send you the parts i have & you install the vesc when they are available. at least you something in your hand to keep you amused

@onloop, thanks for getting back to me quickly.  Okay, I'm just gonna assume nothing will burn down and the ocean won't swallow your house.  If there's a pretty solid bet for May I'll leave it as is.  I'd rather have the full board with the VESC installed and tuned perfectly.  If there are any issues and further delays that come up, then I'll contact you again.

First off, I am pissed off that your Carbon fiber decks were damaged upon shipment like that!! That is some real BS!! You are clearly working your ass off and you gotta deal with that. I'm sorry that you have to go through that! 
I think it is great how you are posting up videos. That is a very cool level of transparency that you just don't see in business. It adds a human element to Enertion. I wish you the best. 

**To anyone waiting for your boards**...Please be patient, shit happens!...Good things come to those who wait!! :sunglasses:

You might just sneak in......

the truth is that some vesc could possibly die during testing, some customer can possibly cancel before we ship...

so the dates i say can still have some slight variations.

you know when you get a tracking number emailed to you. then its 100% confirmed

Hey Jason! I am about to order a raptor dual motor from you and am very hyped about it. I watched through many videos of yours, read the posts and decided to go with you instead of the new evolve board. I want to support this men i have seen in those vids and hope that the product is as amazing ad it seems. 
Today is 3rd of May and I wanted to ask with the problems you have on getting the VESCs, can you give me a time you think it will take til I get my board 30-60 days?!)?
The weather is just awesome atm here in Germany. 
Greetings and really looking forward.

Hey, I am sure it is a great product.  But the only issue is that it is taking forever to get. If you want to wait till I get mine, I'll be doing a good video review on it since there isn't a lot of quality video reviews on the raptor yet.

as far as I know, the only batch that shipped was the first, the ones with all the problems. He recently released a video updating deliveries of the second batch, approximately 2 weeks ago. my order date of feb 9 (order 2064) would have put me in this group of boards going out. I have received no shipping notification as of yet. I don't know if anyone here has. If they have, please speak up. I understand Jason's problems with suppliers, I hope he wasn't making that promise based on parts he didn't have yet. If he did, I'm reminded of the saying "don't write checks that your ass can't cash"

Jup. Iam somewhat confused. I've order right after estimated shipping changed to late May. If all other orders delayed than what's the estimated shipping for those orders of mid. April?
And what is the major problem? The Carbon decks, the vescs, manufacturing ?

I have no idea, the wait was on VESCs which he said he got already.  I had an estimated ship date of late April when I ordered.  But what worries me is there are people here who ordered way before us, like 90+ days ago whose board hasn't shipped.  I'm literally checking my email daily and waiting for a notification.  I can't wait 90 days!  I need the board to get to places in the summer.

As of now I have received nothing, no board no shipping info. I put the question out there if anyone has but no ones coming forward yet. I would have to conclude you don't have a snowballs chance in hell of seeing your board any time soon. As to the vesc delay, that shouldn't have affected the boards going out the week of june 20th (when he posted the video saying some boards were going out next day), because if he were shipping that soon those boards would have been assembled and tested already meaning they were already completed boards

I sent an email yesterday asking about this. He responded by saying that they're working hard to ship the boards out, but he did not give a new eta. 

It's pretty frustrating when for those of us who ordered before March have seen the estimate shipping date slide from the end of February to late May.

I know you are all excited to get your raptors..... But please try to relax just a little bit.

I will give you an update now.

This photo was taken april 19, it is 5 raptors just before they got sent out, those very patient people had been waiting much longer than you guys.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BEXs03aAW2Q/?taken-by=enertionboards

here is another raptor on its way to someone else who has been waiting much longer that you guys, this photo was taken on april 21st.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BEdAhgaAW3i/


6 was all i could send because the other decks from that batch got sent back to be reworked.


This photo was taken april 29th, it's the day i received 20 decks (all good but one is perfect), many of these are probably for you guys.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BExfZSYgW8p/


this video is from the following day, the 30th, they are all built & waiting for wheels!!
https://www.instagram.com/p/BE0QqzdgWx1/?taken-by=enertionboards

Why are they waiting for wheels? because the wheels i ordered in January took about 4 months longer than expected to be made, mostly because the Chinese factory doest give a fuck about you or me....

what is even worse is that these wheels have now been stuck in customs for the last week...
don't believe me? here's the tracking details: https://m.tollgroup.com/mobile/#trackeableEntity/500912465336PRIO

They should have been here in late march at worst, but they were not! and the factory doesn't give a fuck... it doesnt matter how much i bitch about it on this forum they don't care.

to top it off they were all made with the wrong colour profiles... so i was ultimately forced to accept an overdue & incorrectly made order just so that you guys got your custom-made high-performance limited edition electric skateboards in a timely manner....

Do i like paying for goods that are made wrong>? NO! would you guys have lost your fucking minds if i told you i had no wheels and couldn't deliver your raptors until late June YES? is this something that i could have plan better, probably not! Will i buy from this china factory again NO WAY!

Now just to make it clear, some of these 20 cannot ship until i get the VESC, the VESC will be shipped from US around the 20th of this month!

So some of you guys are not going to hear a peep out of my until i ship your boards & you get sent an email saying i did....

I am not going to come here and post snippets of info each day, If you want info follow my **instagram OR my youtube account...**  & enjoy the ride!

It's 9:30PM on a Friday night and i would like to sit with my heavily pregnant wife and relax....

If you can't accept anything i have just said please post your order number & tomorrow morning i will give you a full refund.... & you can go & buy three magneto china clones...

From now on please try to be patient.... your RAPTORS will ship.....

there is not a single other board in the entire world with these features or performance, boosted have stoped shipping, inboards is not even near ready yet, marbel is complete shit, stary is overdue, bolt is overdue.... & evolve is still evolving....

I am literally the only guy in the world with this level of awesome shit.... I work 3 days per week from my garage! I am working really hard.

**give me a break - otherwise i will break, then nothing will happen**

Goodnight.

P.S. Sorry for sounding like a whining bitch.

Thanks for the update Jason. I've been following this thread for a while. Haven't even ordered yet...under normal circumstances for an ordinary product I would probably hold off because of the delays. But this is no ordinary product, and I just sold my BB because I believe you will deliver. When I get my raptor I will show my ~200 subscribers on my BB-centered youtube channel how awesome this board is and get them to switch. Have a nice weekend!

Boosted Mods -- I started it with the intent of showing newbie owners how to maintain/upgrade their board. It will probably become more a beginners channel for eboard DIY builders as I learn the ropes myself. I think there's a lot of value in that since this stuff can be intimidating.

I will say being boardless is quite depressing though (for those of you that sold your previous board for this one). I can sympathize with the frustration. Only having so many months to ride before the weather goes to shit is also frustrating... 

I'm prepared to go the whole summer boardless if it comes to that, better than waiting on unannounced, underpowered, unproven boards that could turn out to be shit. As long as it gets here and has been thoroughly tested I'll be happy.

Hey @onloop! Jason, I just ordered my dual motor raptor and am so thrilled. I know it will take time until it will arrive to germany but hey, the job you do is amazing! I am glad to support you and hope you get time to calm and enjoy time with your family. Keep up the work and enjoying it.
Things like the wrong or broken products from certain companies is shit I have to deal with almost every day. Your frustration is going to get less for sure! The good days, working at something with your "passion" and also for awesome (happy) customers (that you will have) are what you have to keep in mind.
Heads up from Ger and njoy your day!

Thanks for the update.  It's understandable if all that stuff that you explained is happening, but I think as long as your customers are kept in the loop of what's going on they will understand.  The issue is the shipping dates just keep getting pushed back without us knowing why.  And like @Mr_Mahal stated, I have sold my only board that I used daily to get around for this raptor.  So being boardless when the weather is just perfect outside is not fun.  I'm sure the wait will be worth it.

P.S. @Mr_Mahal you may want to submit a channel name request to youtube since it won't be boostedmods anymore, maybe a more generic name.  I'd still keep those videos for newbies who are just getting a boosted.

i literally found out about the wheels being stuck in customs yesterday... I knew they were taking a long time. (they should have been here 3 months ago).. so i was patiently waiting.... there is nothing i can do.... but wait

then custom office calls says they need to extra documents... so i provided them with it....

this is all very common stuff.... i have no intention of doing updates with such things like trying to get wheels though customs....

I will probably mention this when the wheels actually arrive... it would probably go in my weekly vlogs.... but i haven't got them & i have yet to film that vlog.... becasue it hasn't happened yet.

i honestly think that i am being extremely transparent, honest & forthcoming with all aspects of this business... most of it goes in my video updates... thats the reason i do them....

I am not going to be posting in the forum every single snippet of delays...

this post  alone took 10 mins of my day....

Hey Jason! ( @onloop ) Long time lurker. Just recently put my order in for the Raptor and can't wait to get my hands on the board! I had wanted to use this account to do a full review of the board but I hate seeing you get bump out and beating yourself up like this. You're doing really well man. For a 1-man operation i'm impress you've actually came as far as you have. 

The following is not meant as criticism, take it merely as suggestions to help make Enertion a better and competitive global company. I work as a financier and run a few diff companies so I have some if not similar experience to what you're doing. Consistently, a lot of companies go through what you're going through right now; rapid growth. Thats a good thing isn't it? Who wouldn't want their company to grow? 

But the two biggest challenges with rapid growth is logistic and communication. I won't comment on logistic because skateboards supplies or implementations is not my forte. And because all companies are unique, theres not much I can say without looking at the whole picture. 

Communication is what i want to talk to you about. Communication is key to your company growth (more so than logistic). Not communication as in replying messages to your current customers. Communication as in communicating to your FUTURE customers. You can reach them without communicating with them directly. 2 good examples is Boosted and Inboard. Their fans and customers are extremely loyal to them because their communication are superb. There is no doubt your board is better than theirs, but their ability to have their messages reach all customers including POTENTIAL customers is what makes them stand out from the rest. To be fair, comparing your 1 man company to their million dollar is a bit unfair, but the communication part still stands. Hell, Inboard doesn't even have any products out yet and their customers are loyal to the core (even though they keep delaying the M1). Their customers are loyal because of their monthly updates. You can check them out and do something similar, just take 30-60 minutes every month to update your current and future customers on current status until your logistic catches up to your demands. It doesn't have to be long, but details is important. Hire a part time PR manager if you don't want to deal with all the messages that i'm sure you're bombarded with on a daily basis. A growing company needs a growing staff. That way, you can focus on doing what you love, building eSk8. 

As an aside, an example of a company with fail communication: Marbel. Their lack of updates and replying to their customers are borderline stupid and is a textbook example of how not to treat your customers. They grew too big and too fast. They were not equip to handle such a rapid growth. But you're not there yet, thank god.

Your company does transaction globally, let the word "global" sink in for a minute. That means you'll potentially have thousands of new customers tomorrow or next month. And you're the CEO of THAT company. Start acting like one. I empathize with you on your pregnant wife and kids, but do separate Jason the CEO with Jason the family man. I've read your reddit messages, and Youtube blogs (Edit: vlog addressing the logistic issues), they're not objective enough. Leave the company struggles and comparison aside for a vlog or post. Just answer the question that's short, simple and straight to the point, no need to tell them why your board is better than boosted or M1.Your customers know that, thats why they're buying your board. I know you don't care if a few customers wants a refund, but the potential customer are the ones you're reaching for. If you're feeling pressured or stressed, shut the computer down and go out for a walk with your wife and kids ( I do that A LOT). You don't need to show your stress to your customers because all they care about is their board, you're a human so figure out a way to compartmentalize everything or else you'll let your work or hobby seep into your personal life. And remember, you don't owe ANYONE besides your family to responds to their emails or inquiries right away.

Sorry for the long post man but I personally really want to see you succeed, or else I wouldn't take an hour of my time to type this reply to you. I feel that Enertion has so much potential ahead of it. You're like the underdog I want to see succeed. I'm a big fan, so I hope this post helps you out a bit. You have a long road ahead of you and I definitely cannot wait to see where Enertion will go after resolving these challenges. Good luck! 

P.S. Can I bribe you with a nice bottle of rums or whiskeys to put my Raptor ahead of other orders?

Hey Nate,

Thanks for the honest review & advice....

Yeah... i have to agree that the separation of personal life, management of a growing business, trying to develop system & processes required to be a legit business, doing promotional activities, trying to keep my customers happy & trying to push the envelope & keep innovating is a battle at the moment... just ask my wife...

one of the reasons i started my VLOG is to better communicate things to my customers, but it would seem as though it's still not enough to please everyone.... people are just hungry for more & more info... 

I think.... I know, I can do a better job communicating, I just haven't worked that out exactly yet. Maybe a PR company would help... I honestly have no idea.... I am trying to hire an assistant. 91 views not one single application!..[ here is the job ad](https://employers.indeed.com/m#jobs/view?id=d8958aa2b103)

There are so many platforms and so many people wanting so much varied info it is nearly impossible to keep track of it.....

The ultimate solution is to get the stock on the shelf & have it ship out within a matter of hours/days... this way i don't need to communicate about why there is a delay. it will just be boxed & sent.

It might seem like an easy solution, but i am running this business on cash that i get from doing a sale, so I can only buy stock that i have the cash to buy... & considering the rapid growth i am having troubles actually forecasting the exact amount of stock i will actually need on hand to meet demand...

I think they call it growing pains....

I tell you though its one hella ride! thanks for the support.

I whole heartedly concur with Nate. Already a Raptor owner and want you to succeed, so we continue to get see this company develeope and produce awesome boards and products in ebaording. Just keep those post going at end of month, and your Vlogs are great. They are improving alot. Build a good team around you so you can  delegate day to day stuff. We are behind you 100%. When the new Raptor owners finally get their boards theyll also understand what amazing stuff you havemput together.

Spot on.  And bribing him to put you ahead won't work haha, I already tried that.

@onloop, I have no doubt your business will grow rapidly if you have a product with better performance than the main stream brands.  I'm very active on multiple places where E skate enthusiasts like to hang out, and many people are just dying for raptor reviews.  Once a few of your customers put out positive video reviews, you will get swamped with orders.  Be prepared for that, it's a good thing for your business but if you want your business to keep going uphill you will also have to deliver what's promised to all the new customers you will gain.  Hiring an assistant or someone for customer service is a great idea.  Also developing better relationships with Chinese factories or finding reliable factories that deliver shit on time will help majorly.

Keep up the the hardwork, deliver awesome products, keep customers happy.... And you will be rich very soon.  I'm rooting for you man.

I agree that without any doubt he will grow big and things will clarify with ease sometime soon but he wont just succeed over other companies like BB without creating a brand around his product(s). No doubt his boards are the superior ones (thats one motivation why I ordered mine...) The reason why BB, Evolve and maybe others are selling well is besides many other facts because of the stuff behind their board. They create a real product, which has yet to be created when looking at the Raptor under the name/company of enertion.
It is important for jason to find out how people see and experience the raptor (under the concept of it being an electric skateboard), to find out how to establish a real product out if it (without doubting it is one yet)... Like anything is a product in/of our individual and therefor different reality... It is yet to be found out how the product "Raptor" fits into the everyday life of an individual.
I am thrilled, waiting for mine to arrive and share my experiences with it.

Just thought that I would add my 2 cents as a Raptor owner from the first batch.  I had hoped to post a proper review, but I find that I like riding much more than writing.  So here is the quick and dirty from my experience. 

I want to give Jason major kudos on the overall fit and finish of the board.  When I purchased, It was based on the passion I saw on this forum and the hope that he cold deliver something better than I could DIY.  I had a number of the first batch 'issues'.  With help from Jason, Jacob, Vedder's videos and all the other great contributors to the forum I was able to get the Raptor running better than I ever hoped it would.  And it was not that difficult to do with the forums help.  (So thanks to all of you who unknowingly helped me).  

The acceleration is insane. The speed is so crazy I have to dial back the upper limit before I dare let inexperienced riders anywhere near it.  The Space cell is idiot proof, which I love after a life of Lipo management in RC.  I can tell that I'm hitting an amp limit on very steep hills.  It's very minor, but does exist, and will be a reason to look forward to the space cell pro.  Sometimes I miss the flex of a wood deck, but admit that the carbon fiber version makes for an excellent fit and finish with the integration of the battery compartment. The stiffness is also appreciated when riding at speed.  Understanding the VESC is worth the effort.  You can really fine tune your ride.  I'm no expert, I just followed suggestions from the rest of you, and the results are awesome.  The other components, trucks, wheels etc all look good and function as expected.  They are what I would expect from a finished product, better than I expected for a first release.   

I would buy the Raptor again.  It surpassed my expectations.

I have never posted a review on anything, but the Raptor is something special.

Enough typing... Time to ride.

Right - I ordered February 13th. I assume that likely there has been a slight mix-up with order numbers and that's why someone else has gotten their shipping info first. I've had the battery lying around since early march, so it could be the tracking number for these people is for the battery and not the skateboard

I do not have my battery yet and do not have any info about it i only have the board. @StevieD and @treeme do have their batterys already an have their boards on the way so they should be the first ones which will be able to ride the 3rd batch of raptors.
I could post a video of a board i can not ride which would be boring (if i find out how to post a video) but i was not overly impressed by the board at first glance the screws holding the trucks to the deck are corroded a lot of small marks around the battery lid, inside the battery lid it has more of a rough finish and one belt which was totally lose.
all in all i do not think i will be any problem but when waiting for a produkt and listening to Jasons tirade about other stuff which is subpar then i would expect fewer mistakes.

That is unfortunate to hear.  When they send these out everything should be tightened and adjusted properly.  "Ready to ride" should be just that.  

But I think with a board like the raptor you will always have to tinker with it or know how to in order to make it work properly.  The board is assembled by his helpers as we have seen in his videos, and they are most probably not expert skateboards builders.  The QA not being there isn't surprising.

That's great.  I saw that thread, looks like they maybe updating the raptor with a better battery in a couple of months.  If they do I hope we get the updated battery.  I think my order is like 1.5 months ahead of yours.  

I'll continue waiting for shipping notification.  If they got a 100 also then mine should be in there!  Unless enertion is selling a lot more than we think.

Shit, if its gonna take another 2 months or so to get it I'd rather get the regular one first if it means it'll ship out faster...the battery life on the current isn't that bad and it seems like the weight would increase as well if they do. 

Judging by how quick the other orders from Feb started making progress once he got the wheels I'd say March (which is when you ordered right?) will be about the same when they get the VESCs. Definitely think yours is in there. I think my batch will be the biggest yet since that's when more vids started popping up and people started catching on...who knows, but plzzz @onloop you can ship my raptor with the pro3 battery if its quicker/easier :) lol

Hi @flatsp0t i got an e-mail from enertion stating that the batterries are send at the same time as the board but due to being lithium batteries the shipping might take a bit more time than the board.
it seem that you do not get a trackinging number for the batteries if you do not get them from longhairedboy, it might be caused by the fact that the batteries are beeing send directly from china because of the import troubles of getting them to australia.

@flatsp0t i do not know about the batterry but the board was no problem with german custums.
a curier brought it to my house and i had to pay 160,50 as i remember in custom fees.
but that is no even our 19% sales tax so i guess they simpy splitted the value of the board on two packages

It is a mistery what happens in customs! Once they told me that something i ordered was forbidden to import which was clearly not forbidden only because they were not able read, it worked in the end but it took a lot of persuation. I am a bit envious now  that you had to pay 40€ less tax money i could have spend on beer :smiley:

The question how the space cell is declared was my biggest one. 
Please let my know how your first impressions of the raptors are (videos welcome). 

In the latest vlog Jason commented that by the end of June the raptor build process shouldn't have any backlog (in case the sale aren't rocketing.

I'm not totally sure the schedule is the same for the Raptor, either way it's coming. He needs to send more batteries out ahead of time so the deck is all we need to wait for. Think he's trying to keep them both relatively close. 

If this is the Raptor schedule, we'll likely get are boards around the same time. Looks like I'll get this June and then the GT will follow in July. That'd be so perfect. Reallllllly want a board for the fourth of july. Gonna light my board up and speed around downtown lol

Orders before February 27th:
Shipment should be getting out the week of April 17-April 23. My order feel in this group but has not shipped yet. 

On February 27th: Some will ship the week of April 17- April 23, some by May 4th


After March 13th: Waiting on VESCs, could be about 4 weeks, still unclear.

@treeme looks like your original post may need an update.  I don't think all boards ordered in Feb are shipped based on this thread.  But now with the VESC here there should be no excuse, every board that was ordered in Feb should be shipped.

@Mr_Mahal looks like they need 2mm allen wrenches.

Overall, first impressions are that it's fast (haven't gone past half throttle). Things that I've noticed after 2 minutes on board:

* There's a little lag between me pushing the throttle and it receiving (~100ms).
* There seems to be that dead band people have mentioned earlier in the remote. In general, will need to tune the vescs, but that's no issue.
* Wish there were a manual for the remote.
* The raptor likes going fast!
* The braking is very hard. 
* The trucks come really loose.
* Incredibly happy so far!

I had already planned on doing that 2 hour VESC training. Nothing comes fine tuned lol Really I still need to dive into the research I'd do when making my own build -- it would help give me a better sense when something is wrong and how to troubleshoot..all of which could save me from needing to send it in.

Really do hope this gets to me well before the GT does. I have a feeling I'd spend more time on the GT initially if I have to start tinkering with BLDC a lot. After this is all over I'll probably make a video about it for new riders.

@Mr_Mahal Time. Travelling over the weekend and then usy week ahead.

Also, the issue still stands where it's inconvenient to get a regular mini usb cable to fit in the slot. My board, however, cam with the necessary 90 degree usb adaptor to allow for easy manipulation.

After a  ~5 mile cruise ( a fair amount went unrecorded), the main things I've learned:

* DO NOT LET GO OF THE STICK WHEN GOING FAST. When letting go like that, the skateboard lurches
* When slowing down, ease off the accelerator.
* Watch @onloop's video on how to speed up and slow down. It's obviouso after you accelerate, but better having that in mind first.

When slowing down, ease off the accelerator.

Would it equate to basically applying the break by letting it hit neutral? Seems like that is something programmed in, how would you coast if you can't let go of the throttle?

Ha ha it's insane. Couldn't get past eco on my boosted the first day. Even then it was terrifying for a while. Raptor is definitely not a beginner board but a very exciting one to tame I'm sure.

Maybeit's just my remote, but there's no dead band for braking. 

When letting go with throttle on, the brake gets engaged slightly. 

If you click on the remote throttle (like how you can click the xbox remote), it starts cruising.

@ treeme what are your overall impressions?  I'm waiting for you to test top speed and range!  

Also, if you just let go of the throttle it brakes?? I didn't understand that part, it should just coast and have slight resistance from the belts.
```

## \#178 Posted by: treeme Posted at: 2016-05-27T02:37:28.846Z Reads: 119

```
What I mean is: 
Imagine the throttle is on a scale from 0 to 10, where 5 is neutral, 0 is all the way back, 10 is full forward.

When going forward, I have the throttle at 7 (somewhat forward). Then, I start going downhill, so I immediately let go of the throttle. 

The throttle returns back to neutral (5). But when going back, the momentum of the throttle stick brings it back to 4.75 before it hits 5. That jitter causes the raptor to slightly hit the brake (just a bit, but noticable). The brake also cuts in and out sometimes when this happens. <b>NOTE: when actually engaging the brake, it works just fine, but when you just let go of the throttle stick, that's where it kind of cuts in and out</b>.


Overall, I'm <b>extremely</b> pleased with the product so far.

Ah, this is very reminiscent of the BB. With the BB, when you let go of the throttle wheel before letting go of the dead man switch, if you're at speed it will jitter a bit. The way I got rid of the jitter was by keeping my position on the jog wheel static, letting go of the dead man switch, *then* letting go of the throttle. It all works pretty smoothly and allowed me to coast down hill pretty easily. Too bad there isn't a dead man switch with the Raptor remote. Doesn't seem like a big deal though

Yea with the BB I just let the finger trigger go BEFORE letting the thumb throttle wheel go.  

I guess the solution on the raptor would be just to slowly move the joystick back with thumb to neutral position if you want to coast?

Great to finally hear some more Raptor owners out there. I didnt find the so called cruise feature managable. Best to keep with the forward and braking throttle. Tweakng of controller through BLDC tool will allow you to fnd the sweet spot. Enjoy and be carefull going at 45km/hr.

As a gen one Raptor owner I know all the small issues you mentioned.
Dead band can be set on a very small value.
When the board isn't coasting right it is the pulse width setting on the remote.
The right Allan keys should be included.
Breaking and accelerating can be corrected in the bldc tool.
I will let you know my values when I have more time.

@stevied. Ok open up cover of board. Is your transmitter flashing and both vescs blue lights lighting up. This shlould be correct.
Next thing is not good. Shake your remote. Is there any loose bit sounding in there, not noise from the led clear inserts, but like if a part is rattling inside it. loose.
If you cant change the channel of the remote and receiver, I think you need a new remote.

Email enertion support to get action on it. You may need to open up remote to see if there is actually a loose part in there. Positive side is its better to find out now with issue when under warranty then later when not. Enertion should be able to get you a new reemote asap if that is the issue. Did you drop the remote. The buttons do work and light up just not connecting.

Im not really happy as to how Enertion have to send battery separately. I dont think Evolve have to do that. The battery comes direct from the china factory as if its coming from Aus. I did get my battery say 1-1/2 -2weeks prior to getting my board in B1.

I hope the channel grows, the eboard market is still fairly small. Seems like there's roughly under 10k people that watch these types of videos worldwide.

Ahead of you (in emailing), I got an auto-response saying their response time got increased to 10 to 14 days due to a backlog of emails. There was a somewhat updated FAQ in the email in the case it answered my ticket, and it said if I wanted to keep the ticket to respond to the email saying it was urgent. I was kind of asking for you guys (that are earlier than me in the US) so I didn't respond. Figured I'd wait till the end of the week until I panic :)

Blame strict air regulations :stuck_out_tongue: I get why they're there, but there should be a certification process which allows for exemptions. Anyway, yes the anti-spark loop would essentially be the same as an antispark switch, it just won't have the "Switch" part meaning you'll have to plug in the loops to connect the circuit on the battery. See [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204) for more info.

Idk man, I won't jump to conclusions because it's not the end of the week yet, but I kinda figured something like this might happen. I knew the VESCs would speed stuff up for board shipments but I wasn't 100% on how battery deliveries were going. I believe @longhairedboy is the one who receives the raptor batteries to ship to us? Or maybe we do get them from a factory here, idk. But yeah 10-14 days is bad, considering how behind Jason probably was up until he hired his first employee it's not surprising.

There's too much demand, and everybody in the industry (except those that built stock prior to release, like evolve) are at the mercy of their manufacturers. To be fair, it seems Evolve is at he mercy of customs. I hope the US has actually already gotten their shipment...

All the vesc we got in the first batch had the LED on backwards, so they got sent back to US to be reworked, they will be distapatched from US, but the VESC for raptors will need to be sent back to Australia. 5-7 days worth of delays due to shipping to USA & Then Back To AUS

The raptor batteries for US customers shipped from my factory 3 weeks ago, normally takes 3-4 days of transit time, they are somewhere in US & have been for the last 2 weeks, for some unknown reason they have not arrived at distributor. As soon as the US distributor gets them they will be dispatched, i have been told they will get them soon.

We won't be shipping batteries into US with that method anymore.

I can assure you all that we build & ship everything ASAP... we are not sitting here twiddling our thumbs...

We are now getting between 100-200 emails every day mostly stupid questions about what hobby motor & what lipo to buy... this means that we can't always answer the important emails sent from our paying customers because we can only answer about 40-50 emails each day.

I have now employed 3 new staff to keep up with demand, i have been working my arse off to train them and develop better systems so we can scale with the huge growth. New staff normally take about 2-4 weeks to warm up before they actually start reducing the work load.

Please try to be patient we are working as fast & as hard as possible. If you have an urgent email please reply to us & say your email is urgent & we will jump onto it.

I hope nobody thinks you are "twiddling" your thumbs. The thrill for the raptor grows by everyday and I (we) are really looking forward to it.
The waiting is really enjoyable, not joking at all!
Kudos to you guys and take some positive energy!
Greetings from a happy customer.

@longhairedboy I see, thanks for clearing that up.

@Photorph Welp, onloop just explained why. Makes sense now why there will be more delays. I was under the impression that the VESC shipment they got was good to go, but apparently there was a manufacturing defect so now we will have to wait again for the US manufacturer to *not* fuck it up lol I predict the batteries will probably end up getting to us the same time the boards do or a week earlier. 

To be fair I do not blame @onloop for any of this, I've said before pretty much everybody in the industry is at the mercy of their manufacturer -- shipping, keeping in stock, not messing stuff up...I guess whenever there's a chance that we have to wait for a manufacturer to ship something we must brace ourselves for the possibility they did something wrong.

We aren't too far behind if it's another week or so delay. I just hope they get it right this time..or else my GT will be here before the raptor is..

It is a shipping game at this point for the batteries it seems... Who knows what has happened, unless the other German Raptor customers live really near you I don't see why your delivery times wouldn't be a bit different...maybe there was a delay with a driver that does your mail..its anybodys guess. But unless it has really not been shipped at all I'm not sure what you expect Jason to do..

I have not been waiting anywhere near as long as you guys, which is why I'm more patient obviously...so I don't blame you guys for being upset. I just see what's happening to the industry as a whole (esk8 builders selling stuff on here having delays, boosted not being able to deliver soon, evolve still shipping out international GT batches, inboard delays, stary waiting on certification to ship to US backers, jason having issues with manufacturers / shipping) and I see that the major theme with all of them is wanting to get/keep people invested in their product for fear of being left behind. All of these companies have made big promises and most of them (with the exception of evolve and boosted, so far) have pretty much flopped on their promises. The truth is no one (that's worth buying from) is readily sending out boards at the click of a "buy now" button. Everyone is having issues, and to add to the complexity all these companies are trying to ship internationally at a time where shipping high capacity batteries is more difficult than ever, and shipping international in general has never been known to be as quick as shipping from Amazon or w.e. esk8 as a whole is exploding and this is the absolute most busy time of the year for all esk8 companies (that ship to US at least) because we all want to sk8 in good weather..

I guess I'm the only one who can sympathize with that.. I agree that customer service should improve at enertion but you can clearly see the guy is trying to scale a business that he has said has grown 1400% and it takes time...unfortunately we are caught in the middle of it. No excuse for poor communication, I just don't see it as hard to believe.

But be honest if you had been waiting patient for your raptor until Jason got all the part together and then after a few month waiting you finally got your board but no you can not ride it because enertion fucked up sending you the battery, and yes it got more complicated to send these batteries but he had enough time to send these out.
so this is not about being impatient with Jason for not having parts like it seemed in your post above it is about not getting the parts he is sitting on
I just wanted to clarify that

I'm confused...you're saying it's not about him not *having* the parts he needs for the Raptor but not *getting* the parts he needs? He's ordered 2000 VESCs...idk what the battery situation is..but he's been sending them out..again there may be shipping issues for a few customers, some people's shipment may have gotten lost in the mix but idk where you got the idea he's just "sitting" on them not sending them out / ordering them on purpose..

 I guess I just believed him when he said:
[quote="onloop, post:261, topic:2219"]
I can assure you all that we build & ship everything ASAP... we are not sitting here twiddling our thumbs...
[/quote]

What advantage does he have not ordering/sending out batteries? Why would he not be sending things out in general as fast as he could in the order they were ordered? 

It seems like you think he just wants to take your money and run...it does not serve him well to have unhappy customers especially this early in the product's lifetime. That's why I believe he is not just "sitting on" sending stuff to us...hell, technically we could all have at least our boards if he just said fuck it and sent us boards that still had manufacturer defects that he's been encountering..but instead he sent them back to be reworked.. 

I wish it were possible for him to only put stuff on the site to order if he already had stock and not do backorder...but maybe it isn't possible for him. Hopefully he will consider this because this thread is a living example of why you can't give dates / take orders while waiting for things to get to you...

What did I not read? I never said you didn't have your board...I was saying more could've been sent out if everything with manufacturing had went well 1st time around.

Again I don't know what the issue is with the batteries, but your comment above seemed to imply he has them but is not shipping them out for no reason...which I don't think is the case....

I think everything is disorganized because he is changing the way he runs things as time moves a long...he is trying to adapt and figure out how to improve.. It seems things have just not been going his way lately. Idk what I'm trying to prove here you guys seem to understand why this is no easy task for him..I just don't believe putting more negative energy into the situation is going to help him.

@Mr_Mahal I'm not sure what's going on with Enertion and the manufacturers but I will not be surprised if things just keep getting delayed more and more.  I'm not blaming enertion for it, although I do think they can do slightly better.  200 emails a day is not THAT bad, I don't think warrants taking 10-14 days to reply.

I can't go on this long without a board.  So I have a secret that I have been keeping from you, I wanted to share it once I actually have it but I'll just give some details now.  I have a complete board coming to me that will OWN your evolve GT in every way possible.  And yes it will EAT the raptor as well.  If you have some downhill experience, this is the ultimate E-board.

Here are some specs:
-35+ mph top speed (TESTED and CONFIRMED)
-Range of 30+ miles
-ABEC 11 clones, 83 mm in the softer durometer that I wanted
-Fuel gauge display built on the board.  
-It has that black stealthy look that you love
-Almost every component is made in US
-customer service that is BETTER than boosted, get instant detailed replies.  
-delivery dates will be what is promised, no repeated delays like there are with the raptor.  I will get it this month for sure

I don't want to go too off topic on this thread, but I'll be starting a new thread about this very special board soon enough.  Keep an eye out for videos/photos etc.  I'm so excited about this board!!  Believe it or not, the raptor will be me normal board now and THIS will be the insanely fast shredding board.

 The cost will be less than evolve GT, I can say that much.  However @longhairedboy's prices may be going up.  I would contact him.  Again I don't want to hijack this thread, if anyone wants to start a different thread we can.  I would recommend only if you have DH experience though, or you will hurt yourself.  

Let's keep this thread focused on the raptor third batch.  PM me if you have other questions regarding this other board.

@Photorph I'll just say this before you move the conversation: congrats! lol I was about to ask how much you paid for all that, seems like he is being extremely generous with the price because idk how the hell you could get all those parts AND all that custom work for that price....seems like you should've cancelled your order a while ago...but I guess you expected Jason to deliver sooner..

LHB definitely needs to raise that price if he's gonna build stuff like that _custom_ for less than the GT... I'll stick with my order because unless he plans on mass producing that I don't really have interest in it.. Although I like the idea that since he isn't he can provide good customer service to you I know that if he starts getting in a shit ton of orders things might change up quite quickly. Nothing beats personal QA from the creator though. Would say everyone should find a personal esk8 builder for themselves from now on lol

If I get s shit ton of orders I'll jack up my prices and build a waiting list system and start taking non refundable deposits to get on the list. Then I'll quit my day job. 

What I will not do is sacrifice any part of the experience you get from buying a board from me. 

I appreciate the love, but Let's get this thread back on track now.

I was about to say this. @Photorph your comment is smug but a bit pointless. Getting a bespoke hand made board (by a legit artist IMO) is awesome, but how does that scale to be relevant in comparison to even small volume manufacturer boards...? If enertion is a good guide, you are ignoring too many challenges of scaling up to make a point valid to anyone other than yourself.

For the record @Photorph , Jason replied to my email an hour ago -- I never replied with "urgent" so this was considered a regular ticket. Didn't say anything I didn't already know but I really appreciate him getting back with me same day (considering I technically emailed him at 4 in the morning there this isn't too bad) :) Hopefully this type of response time will continue and things will improve for everyone...

Good to hear.  Like I said I have no complaints about enertion and I'm sure Jason is doing his best.  The 14 day reply time for emails seemed excessive but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I'm still excited about my raptor.  I'm glad I picked a LHB board vs evolve.  I already had ordered the raptor so it was too late to do anything about that.  So I'll end up with a carbon fiber board and a wood board with ridiculous power.  works for me :). [quote="Mr_Mahal, post:317, topic:2219, full:true"]

The raptor batteries for US customers shipped from my factory 3 weeks ago, normally takes 3-4 days of transit time, they are somewhere in US & have been for the last 2 weeks, for some unknown reason they have not arrived at distributor. As soon as the US distributor gets them they will be dispatched, i have been told they will get them soon.

@Photorph I once had my boosted board belt service kit delivered to a neighbor in another building. Spent like 2 hours calling back and forth between post office places and long story short the $*#*@ never knew who she delivered it to. Walked out to go for a ride (belt hadn't snapped yet) and my neighbor was on his way to give it to me. I am very untrusting of any carrier to do things right so not surprised if our batteries are out in some random center....

I am not sure what else i can say to you guys....

so here are some general facts.

- Each carbon fiber deck takes one day to make, so max 30 per month, sold 60 last month, need the new mold, take 30 days to make the mold.

- Batteries for raptors were made months in advance, they were shipped weeks in advance, 3 weeks have passed and there is no trace of them, the latest news is they will arrive this Sunday to my US distributor... fuck knows how that is possible on a Sunday. The distributor is waiting & ready to ship to end user.

- I just ordered 250 batteries, my last order was 100, the order before that was 50, then 20... this is about 4 months of ordering which illustrates the growth. All batteries orders are paid 100% upfront with supplier... So please don't cancel your orders, don't order at all is better. Forecasting extreme growth is not easy.

- we are now out of stock of raptor batteries (hence why i pushed the date for new raptor orders to after June 30th - all existing orders are covered), the last 100 i ordered was meant to last 3 months, it barely lasted 1 month, it's hard to forecast 1000% growth.

- Shipping regulations have changed about 8 times in 4 months! at one stage i couldn't even bring my prototypes into Australia for testing, the current method we have selected this time for shipping into the US is cheaper & sounded promising for large qty bulk consignments but it was a new channel & they have let us down. We are reviewing our international battery shipping options. There is a chance regulations could change again.... 

- If we can't secure a reliable & affordable route for international battery shipments our prices will need to go up to accommodate the premium direct to your door shipping option that we used to offer, 6 months ago i could ship batteries express to your door for about $60, now it cost $120. My prices have not yet been increased. Considering using sea freight & dumping huge stockpiles in EU & US, sea shipments are also slow & problematic.

- I have 2000 vesc being made, the first batch was overdue 2 months, mostly due to my extremely strict guidelines. The last batch got rejected as LED was on backward. The VESC worked but LED didn't. Once they are sorted out (7 days from now) i will have the world's largest supply of VESC, Maytech is considering buying from me as they can't get theirs working. Be warned. I will also have the best warranty.

- I have spent the last 3 weeks recruiting, I have 3 new staff members, they will take weeks to train up, but already i am starting to see the workloads being reduced.

- my garage can produce about 30 raptors each month, maybe up to 60 once we are optimized with new staff trained, As of last month demand is greater than supply ability. Lead times will keep getting pushed out. We have one of the fastest production boards available.. so i suppose it's popular.

- I will be introducing a cheaper version of the raptor using a wood & carbon deck, same performance & only 0.6kg heavier. Maybe about $100 cheaper. We can produce this deck much faster as we don't need special molds.

- I will be dedicating most of my working ours to negotiating deals with off-shore agents to help build raptors, with an agent in the US & EU i think we can build between 100-180 raptors each month, this seems like a lot to me now... but if growth continues it might only be one month worth... its sort of hard to predict at the moment as the growth is huge.

- Eventually, i will consider using facilities in china to produce the Raptor, i am worried about the IP & The quality... I will need to dedicate weeks & weeks on that deal... But it is the only way i can scale to meet demand.

- I might offer the raptor as a disassembled kit, this will be much easier as i don't need to dedicate resources to building and i can streamline my fulfilment. For this to work, the product needs to be cheaper. I'll try to save people around $100 on that option.

- I try to spend a few hours each week designing new products & innovating, not being on the forum has helped free up some time. I plan to keep releasing more unique, cheaper, better products every few months. Only with your support can I keep improving our offer.

- I used to answer all the emails, do all the ordering, pack all the orders & build all the raptors myself. My systems worked great! but that was only good for the scale i was at, the business has grown rapidly, we have 20X more orders to process each month... its not so small anymore! it takes time to train staff & design new systems... Literally the entire business needs to be redesigned, all our systems, our supply chain, our fulfilment, our customer service... **We are working on Improving Everything now.**

- Raptor prices will be going up at end of JUNE, Existing orders won't be affected.

- I am still a stay at home dad, I work 3 days a week. I am still operating out of my garage.... 

- We have a new baby due in 4 weeks too.

- I have not drawn $1 out of this business for personal use, I don't earn an income from this (yet), every cent is being reinvested in the product & growing the industry....

- I work about 16hours each day (when my boy is sleeping I also get 2-3hours of work done)

## MY MESSAGE TO YOU ALL.

- Please don't order if there is a chance you will cancel, it's a waste our time & makes forecasting & planning our production schedule 10X harder. Cancelling an order takes 10-15mins of paperwork and means we can't accurately answer questions about delivery schedules.

- Please don't spam our inbox with questions we can't answer. We can't give exact dates, sorry. Please accept our generic responses as in many cases this is the best information we can offer at the time.

- Please think carefully about your order, review your cart carefully before paying, we can not change your order, we cannot change your address... Asking us to do this is a waste of our time. Bitching about it doesn't change anything.

- Please be patient

- Please don't let negative energy flow, Try to accept that we are working our arses off to deliver a product from our tiny garage to people all over the world... The world is fucking big place!

- Our product is very unique, it takes time to get it perfect & i don't want to be pressured into to cutting corners.

- Please keep supporting us, the positive energy from the community keeps me going... 


**THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT!**

I never mess my address up, and in some ways I can understand the back end of your database may not allow for appending orders with ID's and all that, but why can't you change someones address? In the instance that they put the wrong house number in are they just supposed to go over to whomever's house it is and tell them to call you when they get your package? 

I suppose a workaround for those that make that mistake would be to request it be held at the local post...just seems a bit annoying..

Besides that, thanks for the detailed update on everything. The battery info was the missing piece of the puzzle people have been quite upset about...

I walked across my battery that has shipped within 3 days of receiving the notification and want to give you some of my positive energy. Looking forward to the board, as do others.
I just dont feel any reason to argue with you in any way, call me childish. Maybe I am too young and balanced out at the moment. Maybe because I was lucky and I am not waiting for any parts "overdue".
Just a simple and short "keep on what you are doing and have a great day" post.

Hello, i am following this thread form beginning, but this is my first time posting :slight_smile:
My battery arrived with NO CHARGING PORT. All i can see is some yellowish plastic and circuit board..
I tryed to cut foil a bit to see if its just dislocated...but cant find it and i am afraid to cut foil more....also piece of plastic ring which support rubber cover is broken.... damn.  I already wrote mail to support twice and replay with urgent mail...but no answer due to email problems they got :( . I am really sad coz I got faulty unit :( after so much waiting, guess no luck. I hope I wont wait again for so long I already, almost got in my hands.

Advice on this should not be given. The Raptor is fast enough as it is. Any faster and you are getting into real safety issues, but we cant stop you from modifying your board. If you do mot it though id be interested to see what speed you can get. i have reached the suggested 45km/hr

Thats so disappointing for you. Go through enertion support email. Put urgent on it and say battery problem. No doubt theyll just get you to send these pics and send you a new one as a replacement. Theyll likely ask you to send it back, but doubt it. The picture should be enough for a replacement.

Dont be to dishartened by this. Just one of those things. When your finally up a running youll forget about all the issues. Just be patient.

to be honest as long as nobody asks for anything forbidden i do thing we are free to answer only because someone thinks riding faster is unsafe does not really give any reason not to help.
its like people who are saying driving 180 kmh on an autobahn is unsafe no it is not for a reasonable driver it is no problem to drive 250.
what speed is safe depends on the environment, the skill, the ride and the protection gear.

i do not want to be rude but i do not like it when there are the made up rules by a community which nobody did vote on or anything but someone said it first and than they are there.

@chaka for example is riding all the time faster and he seems to be alive.  

@nate you can make your board faster through gearing or bigger wheels
with bigger wheels your center of gravity is higher and the board is more unstable
but beware whichever route you choose you will have less torque.

You are unlikely to get the full range if continuously going at top speed.

Mhm, i think it is like normal motor. You will need more power to accelerate than holding the same speed. So it would be better to go fullspeed instead of braking and accelerating again and again. Please proof me wrong if i am not correct!

I have the same opinion and the need for more top speed as well.
My Raptor has run more then 800 km now and as a former downhiller I want some more speed now.
I'm looking for some bigger motor pulleys.
I have done some math:
16t = 48.9 kp/h
17t = 51.9 kp/h
18t = 55 kp/h
Does somebody know where to get motor pulleys with 8mm hole, keyway and screw? Everything I found is with smaller hole or without keyway. 
The torque of the Raptor is so massive that you shouldn't get a problem imo.
I don't want to hijack this thread sorry.

@DeathCookies Ok.  In my experience where I skate it is at varied speed,  but where you lose on efficiency of power as your braking you gain a little back on the regenative  side.  I can brake and accelerate and that space cell is amazing.  Theres timed when its hit 0%, but I can still make it home. I do believe technically you may be right as I recall onloop mentioning something liike that to me. I dont have an open track to go consistsntly fast for 30km unless your on a track ring.  Maybe others have tested it with your scenerio.  I probably should have worded my post a little better. My thoughts were though that if your going full pelt it will eat up power quicker and thus likely to deminish range.  All I can say is the Raptor dual is awesome.

Ok you and @HH1 are right as well.  Its up to the individual owners what they want out if it. Its what speeds your comfortable with.  Just read @RunPlayBack thread on helmet and  safety gear,  so was thinking to myself I thought even with safety gear on the Raptor was fast enough.  But should of said for me.

Batteries for raptors were made months in advance, they were shipped weeks in advance, 3 weeks have passed and there is no trace of them, the latest news is they will arrive this Sunday to my US distributor... fuck knows how that is possible on a Sunday. The distributor is waiting & ready to ship to end user.

Yep I will have that by Friday!  I got under promised and over delivered, and that honestly felt so good lol.  Thought I would get it late June.  

But this raptor, I don't know how much longer I can wait.  I thought May would be my cut off, but I convinced myself that mid June would be.  Now I'm just giving it till end of June..and this is my FINAL extension.  If nothing happens in June, I will have to email enertion until I get a refund.  I'll just go with the evolve GT...or better yet another LHBB (hub motors, lighter deck) if the one I get Friday lives up to expectations.

I'm afraid to say I might do the same honestly. As much as I reallllly want this Raptor I'm thinking if I'm gonna go the DIY complete route I might as well go all the way -- even if I won't use the full power (I'd likely get a smaller battery than you). At this point I just think it's a matter of the manufacturer not fucking up these next VESC batches...because if they do things will likely take much longer.. @longhairedboy might have another customer..

Per onloop...

"Latest VESC manufacturing schedule.....

6/10 - 150
6/17 - 200
6/24 - 300
7/1 - 350"

I'm not sure if those are the delivery dates or the manufacturing dates, since he said it's the "manufacturing schedule".  Regardless, he said all pending VESC orders should be caught up by end of June.  So I'm thinking our boards should be done this month.

And the battery I don't know about... hoping it gets shipped this week!

but not only do they have a lot under the hood i also do think that they do look marvelous 
and in dual drive about the same price as as evolve gt which is also a really slick locking board but also not in stock in opposition to ollin boards which hell build for you but which you will get in a timely manner

Try to upload it to an image hosting site and send them a link. It may have been rejected because of the size like you said. Compress them online too. If you took them with your phone they probably have a lot more detail and meta data that's not necessary and taking up MB.

This is very strange.

Thank you for your reply. It appears that no, your battery had not been shipped previously. We have been in contact with our battery factory (as due to shipping regulations for batteries, they ship directly to the customers) and we were incorrectly advised your battery had shipped. We have advised the factory that shipment of your battery is now urgent and do apologise for the delay as we were not aware it had not shipped. 

As soon as we receive the tracking number we will forward these details to you immediately.


so 4 weeks after sending my skateboard out and an inquiery by me and i think two by @flatsp0t, as far as i remeber, where they always said just wait, they found out that they did not send our batteries out 
 to make it even better jason said a few days ago that they are now out of batteries and are waiting for new ones, which well all know can take forever

we have your battery in stock, it was already allocated to your order & we assumed it had been shipped, it's just that an error was made and the factory didn't ship it as per our instructions....  the battery fiasco is being deeply investigated at the moment.

Honestly, this is all my fault.... I didn't have systems or staff in place to help me manage the explosion in growth.... the stuff i use to organize myself each day got stretched out to each week and some things didn't get checked properly and communications have not been followed up correctly....

also it is now china holiday, so nothing will happen until Monday.

I promise everyone that enertion is always learning from mistakes & making improvement... over time we will have solved all these problems... we will be experts at worldwide logistics...

**Yes, i think by mid july the chaos may have settled down....**


we will have ample vesc stock
we will have a huge amount of stock of motors & wheels & all the small parts.... Orders are 10X bigger qty now
we will have implemented better system for dealing with customers inquiry
we will start using inventory management systems to track stock & better forecast with suppliers.
we will have 3 fully trained full-time staff helping me
we will have the best warranty on our electronics products.
we will have an EU repair agent that can solve the simple problems
we will have new & improved products that make building our completes faster

```
yesterday we realised there were 6 batteries found in the battery factory, we had already told them to be shipped weeks ago...

the new logistics company we started to use to get battery into EU & US is really incompetent, it takes them 3 weeks to give us the tracking numbers, mostly because the consignment leaves China as one large pallet, then gets split into individual consignments at the destination country, which then generates the individual labels. This new process completely ruined our system as we could not easily see the movement of our stock...

hopefully we can use our new EU agent to receive stock & redistribute it in the EU....

next option is we will split our battery into 3 small blocks that are under 99wh, they can then be joined together by the customer... we will not give up... we will find a way to get our products out...


otherwise we are fucked... shipping batteries is extremely complex these days....

this option would be great also for flying.
simply 3 rows of 10s which you can connect if you want the range or simply use one 10s1p if you want it light or for flying

[/quote]
1p is not a good idea due to the current a single battery has to provide.
18650 can give up to 30A which is not enough in some cases.

It would be better to split packs in series and do 3S 3S 2S 2S or something that can be added to 10S in the end. This way you could also combine them as 6S, 7S, 8S or 9S for reduced weight and less top speed

to be honest i have no idea of electrics

That could work I think, but would have unfavorable results for acceleration and "hillability".

[/quote]

not as far as I know, as the voltage is mainly limiting the top speed. At lower voltage you can have the same energy output as with high voltage - all you need is higher current.
The thing that is controlled by the VESC is the current while the voltage stays nearly constant (3.X to 4.2V per cell). So with reduced voltage the VESC can just use higher current to compensate. At higher voltage and limited current draw the VESC can only go up to the (in this case relatively low) current limit.

Think of it like:
Volt: How fast the motor can turn (top speed)
Ampere: How quickly can you get the motor to turn that fast (acceleration)
Top speed stays nearly constant while you control the acceleration with your throttle.

I am also curious if the chargers ship with the batteries, as I only see 'battery' and not 'battery and charger.'

@Khayman No. Enertion don't give you an idea of where the order number is with delivery date. Please look on his uodates as I think he says from when you placed an order then gives an idea, Vescs are the issue for the delay which are now coming this month. At a guess you should get it no later than end of June early July. Just be patient.

Also i added you order number in my thread in where are all the Raptors, dont have your city or suburb for that list if you want me to add it.

Yea I kind of just want the raptor asap as my lightweight cruising board where I don't have to wear leathers, 15-16 lbs is gonna feel so light now!  Just gonna go full face with elbow/knee pads/gloves. I love my LHB board but it's a beast to carry around at nearly 22 lbs and I have to get into a leather race suit just to be safe.  I dropped a lot of money on moto GP level leathers, I wear those now since I'm always going like 35 mph on the LHB board... and I'm not sure if the brakes will cut out on me.  When you go full throttle and then go full force brakes the board just stops responding period.  So I have to train myself not to do that.  In the mean time, I got http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/dainese-laguna-seca-d1-perforated-race-suit

I feel confident about crashing at 35 mph w/o a scratch on me cuz of that overkill suit, I bet I can even take a bullet lol. I swear I'm like a local celebrity, people are always pulling out there phones and taking pics of me when I wear that race suit with a full face on an E board.

I'll take it off your hands buddy :) lol sounds reasonable, I guess I'm just saying we're in the final stretch. Seems the forces have played against you quite a bit, and now they are asking you to hang on tight. Thankfully you have a board to ride which most of us do not have at the moment but are still patiently waiting on..

The suit looks sick, definitely wouldn't want to wear leathers though. Even in the winter...that'd be for pure leisure riding, not practical to walk into the office with it for me lol

Haha no I'm not giving up my LHB board ever, that's an awesome board.  I'm gonna hang on tight.  No reply from enertion yet, but I got the battery update.  Just not a shipping notification.  

What plans do you have for videos with the raptor?  I'm trying to make more videos, but kind of running out of ideas about what to do.  It's hard when you're the only person filming and trying to ride.

I have quite a few plans :) mainly range testing, torque tests, braking distance, hill climb ability (shit ton of hills to test on), demonstrating the kick tail, basic owner tips, comparisons to the BB and GT, top speed test, and well I could go on forever lol lot of this stuff has been answered but none of it has been proven with good video evidence (& aggregated into one channel) so I plan on doing exactly what did for BB in essence except oriented around performance first, other stuff second.

I have a buddy that will have the GT and can help me film some stuff, but really all you need is an action camera with a helmet or body mount in terms of filming. For certain stuff I will be taking my dslr and tripod to get some shots. Other than that I will be making some more BB Mods like videos at home and make use of this slider and expensive video head I got : p

Hahahaha, indeed!  I've had some troubles with my Raptor, and always fixed it myself because I'll be damned before I'll give up this board and wait for service!  Jason has been great, but this board has made me very impatient about getting my next hit. :-D

Hub motor AT?  Why not belt drive AT, that would give more torque and for AT that's what you need most.  

Also did you get any tracking info yet for battery or raptor?  I have not still, and no reply from enertion support yet.

Worry about waterproofing it. I know this'll sound weird but I want to build a AT board that I can use in light rain or light snow. I want to use this board when I can't ride the Raptor. 

Ya I got the tracking, but I think you'll probably get it by this weekend or upcoming Monday or Tuesday. Don't worry, you'll get it.

we are in the process of trying to sort out about 150 batteries that are scattered all over the world... it has been way more difficult than we anticipated. Some batteries are still in china waiting to be shipped, some have reached the agent in the final destination country and need to be dispatched, some are still being manufactured, some got sent to the wrong place/people... It's incredibly complex. 

For example: just getting one battery consignment into the US involves an agent in china who collects from my factory, one to collect from the airport in person, in US, as goods are sent via special route for dangerous goods, so needs a special courier to collect at airport customs & deliver to the US distributor, then finally a ground-based courier service to deliver to end user. (similar scenario for EU countries)

It's actually ridiculous.... the last shipment into US took 5 weeks instead of 5 days. They never gave me tracking for it until it arrive in the destination country. So it was weeks of not knowing anything.

To make it worse i have had people cancel orders whilst the battery is in transit, so over the last week alone i have had batteries arrive at people's house who already got refunds.... maybe $1500 worth of goods. let's hope they are honest & return it back to me.

Now It is 11pm here so I can't check into this for you, also to check the status i need lots of details & it can take a few days to locate the consignment as i need to talk to many people who probably don't work on weekends, also i don't know who you are based on your user id, so i don't think it is great to do this here. You really need to email us again asking this question, If we don't reply email again saying URGENT. I am sorry we are trying our best to be quick.

We are in talks with specialist 3PL providers to improve this system, it's just taking lots of time.

Also note, it is Friday night here, we don't work until Monday


_If you want you can PM me and maybe over the weekend ill try to find info for you._

first thing on monday i am doing one last final review of the last two weeks worth of organizing & logistics..... basically to check that everyone has been accounted for.

we believe we have got everything back on track as of today.... but one last check to be 100% sure will be required, we ran our of time today.

there are at least four separate entities involved in each delivery of a battery and none of our systems are linked and none of us are in the same time zones...... nightmare.

So, thank you for your patience.....  It was never meant to be this difficult....

@Wolfwoof  You can't change your address after you've placed an order due to PayPal's rules which is what @onloop uses for orders placed on the site. I'd say put an address you know no matter what you can pick it up from like a family member's place. Otherwise you may be forced to cancel and reorder if you need to change it.

@Mr_Mahal check out LHB's Instagram.  If you want to upgrade your raptor to Chaka VESCs looks like he is doing that for some customer.   I don't know how others ones are but if these chaka VESCs have handled the crazy stuff I put them through, I can pretty much be sure no one else can overheat these.

That is probably true, I was just saying if you want the best proven VESCs you can upgrade.  The first batch of enertion VESCs werent great.  2nd batch is US made so their reliability is unknown.  The only VESC ive used is the ollin VESC and I've gone full throttle on that for quite a bit with no issues thus far.

And still no word on my raptor, I was hoping I get it in June.  Happy that I have my battery, but no board still.  My original shipping estimate was end of April, then delayed to early May, then mid May, then late May, Then first week of june, then delayed by a week because something was wrong with the VESC that was delivered, and June is about to end now... Clearly I've been **extremely** patient.  

Good thing I have another board already to keep me occupied.  But c'mon now, ship me the raptor this month please!!

Hey @onloop, will Enertion be able to make target estimated shipping date for the Raptors next week? I know I sound like a broken record but I really need this board asap. Not that it's your fault, but I missed an important meeting yesterday due to horrendous NYC traffic that costs my company a half million dollar project. I got completely chewed out by my ceo this morning. If I had an electric skateboard or any other transportation unit the story would have been different. 

Anyway, I just need a yes/no answer. If you need another few weeks I'll buy a BB in the mean time. Thanks.

Except its an investment company so booking for a private heli is out of the question for a bid on a project of this scale. Besides, it doesn't make sense to get a heli to travel from union square to downtown (and air travel regulation). I also didn't account for rush hour Broadway which is fukin jammed, got stuck in an intersection for 25 mins. In hindsight, I f*k up (and f*k Holland tunnel and its never ending traffic.)

@Nate I'm also wanting the raptor badly this month but don't think that will happen.  I think they are pending VESCs still, and literally everytime it is promise it's been delayed.  This time onloop stated he under promised and will over deliver with the timeline he gave us...so that means it should have shipped already, but it didn't.  So he definitely didn't under promise/over deliver, now I'm just hoping he lives up to the promise of a June 30th ship date...but somehow I'm feeling not so optimistic.  

I have the battery just sitting there so that's great.  Just want the board.

P.S what's your order number?  I think I'm ahead of you still right, i'm 2784.

Ok, I'll definitely be posting the minute I find out mine ships. When I post you'll know yours will follow soon in the next couple of weeks.  Linda from enertion support told me that they are on track to ship mine by the end of the month.  That was a couple of days ago, the end of the month is like...4 days from now.  So if it gets delayed again, then I dunno what to say...besides don't expect yours anytime soon.

Hi, It seems that the button on the LCD must have been changed to show Voltage instead of %

This could be resolved by removing the outer wrapping material & opening the battery.

I am really sorry for this fault. Please email support@enertionboards.com if you want to discuss this matter further, willing to offer compensation for this.

ok guys I think I am getting two raptors shipped to me by mistake. Or a raptor and something else. I got two shipment notifications... I am pretty sure someone screwed up somewhere and sent me two raptors for the price of one. Free raptor anyone??

@onloop this should get your attention. why did I get two shipping notifications with two different tracking numbers? I already have my battery. I wonder if they sent me two raptors accidentally or sent me something else accidentally. As far as I know the raptor comes in one package only. I have one order for a raptor only and that's what I got charged, and yet I got two notifications with two tracking numbers from DHL. I DO NOT want to be charged for a 2nd raptor. If you guys sent me two on accident let me know what to do, I can ship it back if you send me a label. Or... I can just keep a free raptor if you don't reply. But I don't want you guys to find out later and charge my card again because of a mistake that was made with your system.  Again I'm not sure what exactly is going on or if you even sent me two raptors, all I know is I got two shipping notifications with two tracking numbers.  

I would email enertion support about this, but they haven't replied to another simple question I asked them yet earlier this week.  Ticket 9462.  I figured I'd post this issue here, plus this is an issue more for enertion rather than me.

DHL have been opening our packages & removing the remote controller (becasue it has a tiny battery in it) so now we are forced to send the controller separately. We are desperately searching for an MSDS for the battery but they dont seem to exist.

Calculate about one week. You can follow it with the tracking. Customs could hold it up longer though... Depending if you have the battery received already.  In my case the battery came 5 days after the board. But he's having some customs issues at the moment... (remote is shipped seperately I've heard cause of customs)

Just got my board!   The remote is still pending delivery since it is being shipped separately. \

Initial impressions, the board is actually feeling lighter/smaller than I expected. Maybe because I got used to carrying around my 21 lb giant LHB board.  I didn't do an boxing video because it was literally just in a cardboard box with bubble wrap.   I am missing two screws, but not a big deal because I don't think I will not be using all the screws to hold the lid in.   Also the front left screw hole came stripped, so I won't be putting a screw in there anyway.  The lid has a whole for the on/off button and the charger, it barely cleared the on/off button.  But the on/off button still works, even though it's like touching one side of the opening on the lid.  I like the looks of the board.  

If this works as promised (which I'll find out when I get the remote),  I think this would be an awesome board!   I still have to check all the screws and nuts to make sure everything is tight.  I still feel more nervous about the reliability of DIY component builds vs the boosted I had...but I really hope this is a dependable board that will last!  

Can't really comment on much else, but I'll make a proper video on my YouTube channel once I get the remote.  I may also do a comparison video with the boosted and the LHB board.

My channel above, you can subscribe or just check it occasionally cuz I'm not going to post comparison videos and stuff on this forum.  Now just hoping my remote gets delivered soon and everything works!

[/quote]

ok, i think i know what is going on here, we originally had 12 screws for holding the lid, this was overkill & slightly annoying... so we removed the top 2 & bottom 2. the lids therefore only have 8 holes....

what seems to have happened is this deck had a 12 hole lid. I do have spare lids with 8 holes only, i will send you one.

Please order the ZERO DOLLAR part: http://www.enertionboards.com/how-to-build-eboard/custom-board-upgrade-charge/

please write a note saying the problem and what you need.

Hey, just got a call from customs 5 Minutes ago.
I am in need in providing a serial/chassis number.
Happened to somone else?  
So to my knowledge i do not have that information, i wrote an email to enertion, but mayby im stupid and that informatiom is somewhere?

-  Update: I had to explain to them that a chassis number wont be existent for a skateboard, so they gamve in, so i now nees the clear descrption and the serial number of the motor.... There is no way for me to know that right?

Great to hear you finally have your board,  but disappointed you still have to wait for the remote now.  Its a logistic nightmare.  Why dont Evolve or Boosted have thesd issue. Must be DHL. I mean whats up with a small battery for a remote. 

Cant wait for your vids.  Just take it easy on the first go.  The Raptor is a weapon.  

Did you try pushing the battery over against the other side so the on off switch is more central to cut out. 

The replacement lid should solve thread issue.That shouldnt have shipped out like that.  Enertion need a QA checklist. Its not that hard to do that and check before shipping it.

Thanks, but this won't fix anything because the hole in the board is what doesn't have threads anymore.

The current lid is fine, just has two extra holes which I can cover up with black tape.  The top left hole in the BOARD is what doesn't have the threads anymore so nothing will screw in it.  A new lid will only help to cover two holes, I might put an order using the link you sent me anyway if it's no charge.  

@Dedbny yep I'm looking forward to testing this beast.  I have an LHB so I'm not stranger to high speeds.  The LHB is really gentle acceleration and braking though, but has a high top end.  So my guess is the raptor will have a lower top end (which is still fast!), but will have much faster acceleration.

@onloop @EnertionSupport
Hey Jason & Team, sorry for asking on here but maybe someone else can help out too.
I ordered my Raptor on the 06.05. and the order was completed this week + went into shipping.
The DHL asked whether I want to receive it and if so I had to pay the 25% taxes for my country.
That is fine and Id pay it any second but it says the price of the Raptor is 2090 AUD.
I remember I bought my raptor when it was a sale or at least I think so and it was about 100 Euros cheaper, which would make the taxes cheaper too.
Have you a clue about the original price?
I checked my mails but see the same 2090 AUD in there but remember seeing a different price on the website, something like 1350 Euros ~1966 AUD.

Id love a quick feedback from Team Enertion or another customer that had this buy.
Need a screenshot of the original price as I bought it to reduce the taxes. Maybe I am wrong about this but I am sure paying less than 2090 AUD

Edit/fixed: The exchange course has changed quite a bit, back then it was 1350 euros, now its 1450 euros.
This is a good info for everyone else that has paid back then. Now I gotta tell the DHL that they dont charge the wrong price

Final outcome: they charged me 25% of the 2090 AUD (Germany) by the exchange course of the 01.07. 
Turned out bad for me but I cant change that. Well still worth the Raptor I hope :sunny:

The decks are wayyy different, and the battery is a 12s4p on the LHB board.  The LHB board has different gear ratios and the VESC settings are tuned differently X

LHB board has gentle acceleration and braking, but has a very high top speed.  I've hit 37-38 mph on it, I'm pretty light though.  

The raptor has more acceleration i'msure (to be tested soon!), and it has a different battery/swappable pack.

GOT MY REMOTE!  For those still waiting in the US, my order was April 6th and I got everything by July 15th.  So just over 3 months, for those still waiting just take this in to account.

There was only like 5 minutes of light left in the day when I got my remote, and I have a rule to not ride in the dark...no lights really around where I am.  So I quickly did like a 3 minute ride on the raptor.  I LOVE IT so far!!  Worth the wait.  @onloop you have created one hell of a board!  The acceleration was the best I've ever had on any Esk8, and the brakes were strong.  The VESC tuning was pretty good, I could control my speed just like I wanted.  I quickly got up to 25mph, and I had more throttle to go.  I'm pretty light so I'm sure I can hit 28 mph on this board.  

More to come very soon...a full dedicated review, with video in it's own dedicated thread.  Quick teaser video below...

Once you have it you will wonder why you never had one before. You will quickly forget how much you paid for it once you start enjoying using it.  With the VIP service you will be looked after. If anything you will want another one, so a friend can go riding with you.

With the pricing its been high for a long time as no more sales. Enertion are now a growing business, so the overheads would be starting to creep in. With that though means they can have that VIP service and improve the way they do things.

Hi !

I got my raptor on friday ! (my order was number 26xx)

I did 2 rides today.
The first one was to test the board and start to be familiar with it, which didn't take too long.
After that i did hills eating with ease.

I really like the board, i have good position on it, i feel secure on it.
The design is great, the board is not really too heavy.

The acceleration is smooth, but it can be really aggressive too.
The remote is good, it feel great in the hand, a bit sensitive but when i use it with the tip of my thumb, it's fine. 
I don't have try cruise control yet (i don't know how to use it to be fair, where can i find this information ?).

With dual motor, big hills aren't a problem at all.
The brake is strong and very reactive (almost no delay).

Two screws for the lid was missing + the handle under the board. No big deal.

So far so good, hope it will continue like that for a long time.

Thanks Jason and his team for the work done !

I hope you will all have your board soon !

(sorry for my english...)

I agree with all of this.  I was also missing two screws, and one hole in the board is just stripped.  Not a big deal as you mentioned.  

Although acceleration and braking can be a bit subjective, the acceleration felt faster than other boards.  After the first try or so I was able to go full throttle forward and stay on.  

I did have one issue, briefly one of my motors just stopped working...but it came back on after I turned the board on/off.

Hey Jason, quick question.
The remote was sent one day after the Board and has since then not changed from "shipment info received".
The board is already departed from Singapore on its way to Europe.
Is everything alright with the remote? Has it been given to the DHL already?

I would siggest not using the cruise. Its not like a car cruise control where it can be set to a certain speed and stay at that speed. Its more like a throttle control.  If you accelerate and then press c button.  The  board may be fine on flat,  bit if done while going up hill it will likely quickly accelerate to make up the speed.  Very unsettling in my opinion.   Just dont think its refined enough.  Better to have more control with speed by not using it.  Also the cruise function seems to work better at higher speeds.  But that also means the less control you have.  ImO

Yeah, i agree.
I maybe have one use case of this feature, when your cruising at slow speed and you need to take off your phone (or anything else), it could be nice to just set cruise control and drop a bit the remote.

By the way, is a remote control manual exist ?

No manual for remote.  Theres a channel change on the forum if you do a search.  Used if you get channel drop out or if you skate with other Steeve owners so the signal doesn't  interfere. 

No cruise will not work at slow speed,  but I agree.  Also make sure you turn off remote anytime you taking backpack off or stationery looking at phone.  If you hit trigger accidentally the board will go flying.

I might do a quick video one day.

Also due to the buttons A & B at front can get damaged if dropped.

@Dedbny is spot on about the remote.

I already broke one that came with my LHB because of the front A & B button get damaged easily if dropped.  

Cruise is no good.  I posted 3 tests of raptor on my youtube channel today.  Did hill climbing, did a range test of remote, did a slow speed control test, did a cruise control test, and tried the raptor as a normal longboard.  Feel free to share with new buyers.

@flatsp0t 
The problem is the rip off DHL does with you.
They charge you X percent of the value inside the box because they lend you the money for two days.
So you pay 19% tax + 2-5% customs + some percent to DHL.
In case of the VESCS witch arrived last week DHL took extra 14 €uro. I would like to pick up my packages at customs clearance to avoid that, but it seem impossible today.
I have told Jason about it, but since DHL is the only working service the problem will stay for a while.
It would be much better if he could charge you the taxes + customs at Enertions shop.
What annoys me even more is that the DHL drivers never have change with them and because you don't know how much you have to pay in advance you usually have to give the drive a very good tip.
Jason/Enertion needs a EU warehouse to avoid that extra costs, because right know the price tag at your door is too damn high!

I think after the first batch the declared price was minus the Space Cell, because it came separate.

Just got my hands on my Raptor, apparently DHL didn't get the memo to hold the shipment in the city so I have to drive all the way to Queens to pick it up. 

Other than that, this Raptor looks awesome! Especially the bottom side with the CF. I wish they'd expose more of the CF on the deck so it'll look more awesome aesthetically but its nice nonetheless. I'm surprised at how long the board is, I was under the impression its shorter than that. Cant wait to get my hands on that remote and take it out for a spin.

Hey @onloop, have you guys stop putting the handle bars on the Raptor? It'd be super helpful to have it when its available (its one of several reasons why I pull the trigger on buying this board.) You designed a rad looking board dude!

Edit: Ha! My fiancee said the blue makes it cool. :joy:

The raptor feels TINY to me because I'm used to my LHB board.  My LHB board is like a foot longer and 3-4 inches wider.  

Also I have a handle as you can see on my videos posted on my youtube channel.  It's very helpful, but with gloves only because without the gloves it bites into your hands.  The handle is something you just screw on basically.  If they forgot it, they can send it out and you can screw it on yourself.  I took it off because I love how the bottom looks so clean w/o it, but then put it back on.

I had 10 holes in my lid, one of the front two was stripped.  I think mine came with 2-3 less screws than there are holes.  You only need 4 though, but I put all the ones I had on.  You won't ever have to take the lid off again, so might as well put all the screws they give you.  

The Witchblade is probably bigger/thicker/way heavier than raptor.  The scarlet is almost 50" long and over a 12 inches wide.  Just measure that out to see how massive it is.  The longer wheelbase makes it more stable at 30+ mph, but as a trade off it doesn't turn as well.  The raptor is 38" long only which is tiny lol.

I don't think its a problem but I'm tagging @onloop and @EnertionSupport  (also about the handles) just in case. I think I'll have my artist friend cut some of the grip tape off and design something for me. 

@Photorph Are you sure the Scarlet is 50" long? thats 4 1/4 ft, thats fukin massive dude! How much does it weight?

mine is the exact same way.  not an issue.  As long as you can hit the button and it goes on/off.  Did you take the plastic peel of the battery charge display?  

The scarlet weights ~22 lbs vs ~15 lbs for raptor.  yea it's close to 50".  

Edit: per LHB's website it's 48"

The both of you, I didnt open the raptor yet because I am still waiting on the controller. Can you link me a post or quickly tell me how to connect the battery to the Vesc and connect the controller.
What a noob question, when I see the Vesc and battery next to each other it will be self explanatory for sure but just to go safe :grin:

No, not yet, i'll most likely leave it on. Ain't no way i'm going to dirty up that display. :smirk:

I was thinking about the location of the on/off button, I think its actually really smart that @onloop designed it to be on the deck so if the connection between the controller and board is lost, we can just turn it off and use our legs to stop it.

The bottom of the enclosure has a double sided velcro.  here is what I would do step by step.

1) Don't mess with the double sided velcro.  Put the battery in and make sure it fits well.  Don't need to plug in battery yet, just see how you will plug it in and where you will lay the wires.  There should be enough space to lay out the wires w/o putting too many crimps in them.

2) Take the battery back out and peel the sticker off the velcro and then just put the battery in.  Plug in battery.  Push the wires in the small amounts of open space that are there around the motor controllers.  

3) Put the lid on and screw in all the screw they gave you.  That's it!

The controller will automatically sync with it.  Turn the board on, hold the top front button until it turns on.  The light should be red when it is connected to the VESC.  Be careful and have the raptor laying upside down, so you don't smash it into something accidentally.  The joystick is very light.  Check to make sure it accelerates and brakes.

@onloop @enertionsupport how shall I proceed with the leftover battery? I opened the box and it really was another space cell. Must have been mistakenly sent to me because the first one was sent a long time ago. I really would love to keep it as a second one, as long as you are fine with it. The second one looks much better manufactured, correctly placed button and no ripped casing :slight_smile:

my deck is 40" with a 27" wheelbase, which is roughly equivalent to the raptor's wheelbase. They're not that far off from each other in a number of ways.


This photo is a perspective shot at a low angle but if you follow the lines of the trucks you can see they're actually very close in length and wheelbase:

I think 40" is more believable. I can't get over how rad the epoxy makes the board look as a whole. Keep up the good work dude! 

Also, since @onloop is too busy at the moment to address the handles question, do you know of any other source of materials I can use as the Raptor handles? I'm thinking about going to Home Depot to check over the weekend.

Just came back from riding this thing. Damnnnnnnnnnnn @onloop, back at it again with the Raptors. The torque on this thing is unbelievable! Its literally instantaneous. I'm following behind a van and I push up the throttle a bit to add speed and the torque just pulls me right up next to the driver, its fukin amazing. Its really not a fair comparison between this board and the other commercial e-board. 

I hadn't plan on doing a review but I changed my mind. I'll post up a review after 2 weeks. After getting the knick knacks out of the way. There's already some tiny issues with the board but its in the process of being fix so i'll talk about that down the line when all is said and done. Amazing board nonetheless.

yep, this is the most torque/acceleration out of all my boards.  It has more torque and acceleration than the LHB even.  But the top speed on the LHB is insane, did you get to max out speed on raptor yet? 

Interested to hear your thoughts, and maybe give it a rating out of 5 or compare it to the boosted.  I think the board may have its quirks, but no denying it delivers on torque/acceleration.  Just like the LHB board, it delivers on high speed.

@Mr_Mahal you're missing out man!

Glad to hear you guys are enjoying the board. Would love to see the GT torque compared to the raptor. I have a feeling they are very similar honestly (the GT eats hills the BB takes its sweet time going up). Only thing I'm envious of is caliber trucks. Then again with time you get used to it. At the end of the day as long as we're all riding I don't think anyone is missing out :) My deck just got swapped and sent out today. So I should riding my GT again next week :p

Ya I did max out, but every time I reach top speed i had to dial it back again because I was at the end of the block. I don't think the top speed should be the highlight of this board (though it is a bonus). Torque, torque, torque. There is no other way to describe how powerful the motors are. Every time I'm expecting the torque to jump in, it just kicks in more powerful than i expected. I felt like i was about to fall everytime the torque comes in, It's not even a push, its literally the board kicking me forward. Thank the lord (@onloop) for the kick tail because it provided me with something to stabilize my foot on. This thing is a monster, I think the best comparison I can think of in terms of torque in automobiles world is the Tesla S P90D, the torque on both these machines is really something ungodly. 

There is no way BB can hold a match to the Raptors. The Raptor is in a different league of its own. Its like comparing a McLaren P1 to a Porsche 911. Everybody loves to compare their cars to the 911 (in the esk8 equivalent, BB) but its market is completely diff so theres nothing to compare. 

I gotta tell you though, that acceleration.....my god, my foot was shaking when I was riding it for the first 10 mins, only three things in this world has ever done that to me: my fiancee, the Tesla P90D and this monster Raptor. I hope @longhairedboy board doesn't have a more powerful torque cause I think I'll need a new pair of pants everytime I get off that board if he does. This Raptor really is the new standard to beat for me.

well depends on how he is gearing your build and what motors he is using, in reality he could have built me a board with way more torque than the raptor at the expense of top speed.  But I opted for top end speed.  Imagine the raptor which has a 10s3p battery and two R-spec motors, now you add a 12s4p custom battery which gives out much more voltage...if you keep gear ratios and same number of teeth on the wheel as the raptor, you won't be able to stand on the board when accelerating.  I think with that battery, you could still have a higher top speed than raptor by a couple of mph and still have more torque.  IF that's what you want.

nopppppppe, I'm good. I'm using the Witchblade AT deck, which has no kicktail, aint no way I'll be able to stabilize on that sucker, especially since my specs is for wet roads. 

Regardless, I don't think any production board besides the GT can stand up to the Raptor for the time being. 

You want to meet up to do a comparo when I come into DC for work in November @Mr_Mahal? :wink:

@Mr_Mahal I would be VERY surprised if the GT can match the raptor.  The raptor has 2 huge 63mm motors while the GT is basically using the same motors that chaka is selling (the 5065 i believe).

I've seen videos of GT where it sort of hesitates to get to max speed, if you saw my GPS overlay video...it just gets to 27 mph so fast, I was like babying the throttle in that video also.

Besides performance though, the GT has a lot of obvious advantages though no doubt.

I know size matters, I'm sure the Raptor has more torque. I'm thinking 0-22 type speed tests would be cool since both get to that speed at least no problem. Most of the time I'm riding it's either uphill or in traffic so getting to 27mph isn't my number one concern, maintaining speed would have to be a top priority. I still have never gone full throttle on GT and I was using the biggest street wheels...still felt powerful as fuck. Maybe it was because I wasn't on a board for a while though. I'm really interested to see how I adapt back to a carbon deck with those trucks. Can't wait to do some testing I never got to do because you know... ;)

My friend will be getting his GT back on Friday and I still have a spare BB to ride. So maybe I can do some mini tests just to show what it's like riding next to a GT. That extended ride video my buddy shot did not show it's hill climbing at all really due to where we were going. Will have to record us going through my neighborhood :p 

@Nate sure thing dude. I will have the bamboo GT by then too :p

The lack of modes really does force you to grow a pair quickly I'm guessing. I don't think I'd be here if I was forced to ride in GT mode from the get go. I typically stay in the second fastest mode which has less torque but same top speed.

So I got my battery today and decided to charge it before the Raptor arives, so I can ride it immidiately. So I plugged it in and went abotout my day for a while, when i checked and turned it on, it went from 34% to 33%. Thought something might be wrong with the outlout. So I put it in a supervised one, tried again for 20 min -> still not charging. Then i tried a different charger i have from my airsoft times which i could set up so its the same voltage etc. Still no charging. Has anyone every had that problem ? Is my battery faulty ? Am i stupid :slight_smile: ? What can i try to determine if the battery is faulty or not ?

Hey everyone, 

Got my dual raptor a few days ago 

Big thanks to Jason and his  team, and this board is 10x better than I could have imagined. 

This is my first long board and first time ever on a electric skateboard, i've been skating since I was about 5, and  once I got a handle on the sensitivity it was pretty easy and very stable to ride. 

I'm from tassie and anyone worried about Hill climbing, don't worry this thing destroys Hills. With a backpack ready to ride I'm 96kg. And I haven't found a hill yet that it doesn't fly up. 
Tasmanian Hills are big and steep. 

Board is very well made, I'm going to have to tighten the belts today but I feel that's pretty normal with new belts and I gave them a workout the first day. 

Only minor issues I've had is, if you click in the joystick while not accelerating, ie. Free rolling or braking you lose all control of the board and it starts free rolling,  but it comes back if you click it in again. Just be wary of this as I had to jump off going very fast dowhill a few times at first not realizing what I had done. I reckon this can easily be fixed with some vesc updating.
 
The other problem is, the brakes don't ease off until you get back to the middle with the joy sick, then it's a bit of a jolt back to free rolling. Again this is something that should be able to get fixed with vesc updates I assume. Not a big issue but makes going down steep hills a bit tricky and slow. The brakes are excellent and will stop you on very steep inclines. 

Overall though I've been the board a workout and its been perfect otherwise. Scary powerful, helmet at very least it's a must. 

Battery life is amazing, and highly recommended getting the fast charger too. 

I was also missing the handle, but i'll message them and they ll and one out!

The only other minor issue is I'm regular but push Mongo and the power switch on the board,  is right where I put my foot for pushing , so quite a few times when I push to get started I accidentally turn the board off with my foot.

Well the switch is recessed in, it would be pretty hard to push with a flat shoe.  You usually need to stick a finger in there, or maybe the side of your shoe.  Also it is in a spot where your foot shouldn't be really, right int he middle of teh board.  I keep my feet close to trucks.

I don't want to jinx anything but I'm starting to think as long as the raptor is working fine, it is probably the best complete non custom board out there.   I am confident all raptor reviews will be of two varieties.

1) the board works and it is awesome and the best board ever bla bla..

2) something is an issue, battery not working, etc...but when teh issue is fixed and they get the raptor going, again it becomes the best complete board.  

I wanted to have a race with my LHB, but no one there to ride with me haha.  I already know the result, raptor will win up to ~25 mph but after that the LHB will blast off and leave the raptor.

I'll take the battery out this arvo maybe something is pushing the batter up a bit from the inside, really the power button is in the best place, i've never hit it off when riding. Only when I'm pushing to get going. I'll work out an solution. 

If you're thinking about ordering a raptor, just do it! You won't regret it. The raptor is already amazing, and it's only going to get better and more refined. 

I gave it a run on the wet last night, up some Hills too and I still had heaps of grip.

You've said that about every board you've owned so far so yeah, no surprise there. Perhaps try to replace the repetitive use of 'best' with the specific attribute that you feel is most important for YOU and your wants/ needs. Once you do that, your reviews will begin to have the value you probably want to offer, and will probably appeal to more people.

Immediate delivery your most important consideration? Nope not the best. Range the most important consideration? Nope not the best. Quick delivery- nope not the best. Reliably fast customer service? Nope not the best. Silent operation? Nope not the best. Quality, small form factor controller?nope not the best. Want 97 or larger wheels or AT, nope not the best. Price? Nope. Light weight? Nope. Board flex a must have for you? Nope not the best. Torque and speed combo with kick tail and a cool retro style your primary want- yes the best. However you weight up all those metrics and attribute changes the concept on what is best for you. You simply need to balance your sweeping statements. Go back and check your boosted, LHB, and now raptor comments. Eg: "proof BB D+ kills Inboard! Inboard can't climb steep gradients!" Well what if you don't have hills and love freewheeling? You proclaimed your LHB as the best board ever period. What if you want to carry your board at the shops or on the bus? Not so good. Not competent in adjusting VESC setting? Not so good. Just get some perspective man and dial back your sweeping proclamations and click bait headlines. Next month I'll be hearing all about your Olin board being the greatest thing on the planet period, when it too, will have strengths and weaknesses that make the word 'best' completely subjective and thus irrelevant to any conversation. So I refute your claim and now challenge you to objectively define your definition of 'best', and invite everyone else in this forum to point out the weaknesses in your argument based on their own respective wants in a board. Or you can just be happy with your purchase, espouse its strengths, and drop the irrelevant use of 'best complete/ custom/ whatever '. Your call.

I mention all these things if you read everything I wrote.  I point out the boosted is better for air travel, has a smoother remote, etc etc.  I point out the LHB is heavier than bla bla board.  I point out my delivery times for each one.  I point out the evolve is more versatile.  I pointed out the boosted has flex and thus is more comfortable.  

I have always stated everywhere that there is no perfect board, the best depends on what each person wants.  What's best for me changes, because as I discover new things what I want changes.  The BB was the best board to me because it was the best board I knew of at the time until I discovered others.  My priorities about what I want in a board changed over time as well.  Therefore the best board for me changes.  That is why when I say "it's the best" I always add something after it to point out what it's the best in.  

On this forum I've been consistently saying the LHB is the best for high speed thrills.  The raptor is the best for torque/acceleration/hills.  Go see my review of the LHB and the raptor.  People have asked me about boosted vs evolve vs lhb vs raptor on reddit, go see all my responses and you'll see I gave a different response to each person depending on what they are looking for.  But if they simply ask what's the best I generally say in a nutshell the evolve for versatility, LHB for high speed, raptor for hills/acceleration, and boosted for comfort/crusing/airline travel.  

My definition of best changes, but the reviews I give are pretty objective.  They are factual, nothing will change the fact that LHB has the highest top speed, or raptor has the highest torque...etc.  The reviews are from my perspective, and in my perspective the raptor is the best overall complete board (excluding custom builds like the LHB and DIY boards).  So therefore I state the raptor is the best overall complete board...(and as i've mentioned many times, I pointed out advantages of others over the raptor as well).

Depends on what you want.  I couldn't pick between the two, what I like more would depend on what I feel like doing that day or what I'm using the board for.  I like my LHB for going above 25 mph and doing long distance riding, and i like the raptor for going up hills and when I feel like blasting off like a rocket from the line.

You aren't as half impartial as you make out, just check your last three posts in this thread. Yep, it's getting better but you still trot out the best board ever claims and forget to add "for me because I need X". Want to head back to your evolve Gt comments, which were even better considering you don't have access to one? I'm checking out of this convo, posting history is your friend if you want to reflect, but do as you please dude.

I don't have access to evolve GT, but all the other boards I have used extensively.  My comments about evolve GT are based on everyone else who owns it and reading their experiences with it, and my experience with using double kingpin trucks.  

I'm actually very fair to every board and give each one the best title in whatever category they deserve.  I am saying best to the raptor in this thread because the few people I was talking to were looking for everything that the raptor promises and offers, and to all of them the raptor would be the best.  I've recommended the boosted board over the raptor and the evolve GT over the raptor to many people.  Go ahead see my posting history on forums or threads that aren't specifically about one board.  In fact here is one from yesterday.

https://www.reddit.com/r/boostedboards/comments/4u0nz3/boosted_or_evolve/

and i can paste many more like this.  Anyway out of respect for this thread, i'm not going to keep going with this discussion.  I stand by everything I've said as everything has just been facts.

And i'm still saying raptor is the best complete board out of the current big players that I have either had or used or read a lot about.  (I'll add a "for me" at the end if it makes you feel better).

Edit: I should also add when the raptor works, it is the best

Whoah. Whats happened to this thread. Everyone has an opinion and its their own. No need to state that everytime you post something. I think @Photorph has more than enough experience and  ownership of different boards to have an opionion between them. Maybe not the GT, but if someone could offer him one to try he would.

I know that all GT owners think theirs is the best eboard at present and it may be for specific reasons which Im also sure would be long. The budget for it is also like 10 fold of Raptors. Lets be fair here. Evolve is a great company with great marketing. Boosted should be worried. 

As far as what I like about the Raptor Dual: carbon fibre deck and its look and shape, lightweight for its size, and good for moving around day to day withh handle, good range 30km, top speed 45km and how quickly it get to that speed, hot swap battery, ease of use, lcd screen on deck, and most importantly the TORQUE from the R-sped motior. The dual loves eating hills. Its so much fun.

Mate I agree with you, and this is what happens when someone constantly turns everything into a pissing contest. Every. Single. Time. 

I don't get annoyed because I think he is wrong about his boasting. I have no opinion either way- I love the raptor, I think the boosted it great, I think LHB is art, I think Olin is incredible, I think there are 5 or 6 insanely good one-off builds. I'm happy with the GT- it fits the purpose I bought it for, nothing more, nothing less. I get annoyed because it is **boasting**. He is in a privileged position and every now and then he chooses to boast. _To boast: talk with excessive pride and self-satisfaction about one's achievements, possessions, or abilities._

I frequent this place too, and when it wears me down, I'm going to point it out. 

TL/DR Owning a board doesn't make you a respected voice. Your actual experience and insight, and how you communicate does. Boasting if of little use in this place. Keep it at home.

Hey fellow enthisiasts. I got a question. Out of the Raptor that were received in the last month, who got a handle with it ? Seems a lot got missing. 

On a side note, did anyone get contacted yet about beind a "test driver" and all the 150 club specials ?

For me the Board has almost everything i wanted, the only thing for me is cruise control doesn't really work that well, but the rest is magnificent and stomps my first DIY build n the ground :)

Edit: has anoyne been able to accelerate full throttel in both modes? I tried it for an hour straight and got pretty close but sill im hesitant. It is seriously scary.

I had a handle but it seems like many were missing.  It's not that special of a handle, I think you could buy any cabinet handle and screw it on and it would work the same.  

What's this test driver email you got?? I didn't get anything.

I can accelerate full throttle with a very aggressive forward lean.  But what 2 modes are you talking about?  Raptor doesn't have any modes.

HI dont think anyone has been called up for beta testing yet. Not sure whether it will really happen. Unlike Evolve who have a massive budget and send out to all parts of the world numerous boards. Enertion had been doing their own testing of the Raptor and not letting the public review mainly I thInk due to budget and thus boards they could lend out. Im still hoping to be that No.1 Beta tester for the AT version or whatever might come my way. I think @photorph might be another, but hes across the othe side of the world. 

What you may not realise? Evolve beta testers would have it for say 3 weeks then have to return it. Now per say as these things are test mules it might brake down after 1 use. I know the GT I got to look at failed and was likely back to HQ earlier than expected. Motor issue.

I think however that it would be great if Enertion let us Raptor owner be the first to tryout their future products as that was part of the reason for the issue with Batch 1 of the Raptor. Internal testing of the throttle was not what most of the public liked. Since then with the batch 2.0 and up, the acceleration and more so the braking has been adjusted. Still has its finely tuned controller, but more forgiving is how it works with the way it delivers it. Just wish it had different modes, beginner, intermediate, and Stig. Not sure whether I made that clear enough.

@michichopf not sure what you mean by full throttle both modes.

As for the handle not all joinery handles will fit the board due to the spacing of the screw holes or the way it gets mounted. Most handles are screwed from behind not from the front. Also batch 1 had the handles painted black which mine came with paint chips on it, so an anodised handle would have been better. This would also have been one of the things that would have been ironed out if on Beta versions. I know there was a discussion as to what the colour was to be. Better as anodised. And I use the handle alot, so if you havent got one on the board i recommend it.

I got notification that my raptor arriving today before 18h :) I am really happy,
but also with that info came tax info , and i have to pay 304 EUR ... :( quite high amount...
because base price is full price of €1,076.38 eur) ...I suggest Enertion to subtract price of battery,(since it being shipped separately ) so we will pay less customs in future, if its possible.
Location is Europe, Netherlands, Amsterdam, tax hungry government...

I will send some nice pic after i get it :slight_smile:

Was a bit worried about the loudness to. But after my first two runs Iam pretty happy with it. As djupex mentioned its noticeable, but in a good way. No need for FOC for me. (Maybe Ill try FOC with new VESCs v 6.0 - They should be more reliable and if I get them I probably have the two 4.12 VESCs as spares if something went wrong).

we have stopped using the previous remote as too many people were breaking it, the buttons at the end are very easily damaged...

the new remote is more robust & more compact.

It seems to be unanimous:

The Raptor needs SOFTER WHEELS. 

Keep costs low by just changing to a softer wheel instead of offering options. Sell the leftover hard wheels on the site for the DIY crowd.

Hey guys, 

Since i got my board (1 year), the board has been more unavailable to ride (due to dead VESC) that available.

It's has been 2month that my last VESC died (idk why...), i contacted the support team which gave me responses but no help in the end.

My board is still unusable, Enertion don't care, i can't do anything more than asking their help (i'm under warranty).

I have never been abandoned by a company before (especially a startup), first time i tried international deal, maybe the last (I'm in EU).

Idk if you guys got the same problem as me in term of support? but it looks like that selling board is more important than keeping things good between their clients and them.

I'm so sad of this situation, i just wanted to keep things good, but it's impossible with the no respect given by them :cry:

Sorry for this post, but had to...

I'll email support. But you should tell them its important for your raptor 1 customers ( and your raptor 2 btw )
