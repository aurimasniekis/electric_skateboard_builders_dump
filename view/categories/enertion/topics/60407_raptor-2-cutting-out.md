Is it in certain spots? Near traffic lights or train tracks?

sounds like motor phase leads touching. I would open it up and see if the heatshrink of the bullet connectors has come loose. 

Don’t ride till you figure out why!

Also, have you connected up VESC Tool to read the settings? Not sure what the default settings are, interested to know if there is an emergency brake current set... It might be beneficial to ride around slowly till this happens again, keep the board powered on, take it home, open it up, connect to vesc tool, read settings, and *check for faults*.

Also, if there is a brake current set, maybe change it to zero so if it does happen again the wheels don't lock up and instead just rolls without resistance. In that case going fast, I'd recommend learning to foot brake and slide in case of an emergency where brakes cut out. Plus all the other suggestions here to tackle the source of the problem and not just mask the problem.

I had this happen to me on my raptor 1. It resulted from a short in the slave motor windings and a fault in the slave VESC. Went full brake and sent me flying into a busy intersection, got very lucky. I would not ride this board above 10mph until this is resolved. 

Do you hear any snapping sounds from motor? 

Definitely plug it into the VESC tool and read faults

Oh man Im glad you're okay.  Sorry this happened to you... That is very strange that it just breaks all of a sudden. Its possible that your receiver connection has worked its way free? 

Either way, I am happy to take a look at your board, we can cover return shipping.

Hi mate cheers yea will be definitely trying to solve the problem as im sic of getting thrown off the board i reading all the feed back i think it a voltage over load and it cuts out locking the hubs at the same time im not good with computers at all but ill try and suss it out only ever hade it tuned by Enertion.

Sometimes snapping sounds from the motors mate but not very often . Ill try plugging in to vesc tool and read for faults iv never used the tool reader so im a bit unshure what to do as im not very good with computers.

A bunch of screenshots and posts about it here. It’s a little time, but you will figure out the vesc tool. The snapping sound could be shorts in the motor windings. The evidence will be black scorch marks on the windings. Happened to two of my Enertion motors a couple years ago.

This is just a stab in the dark but make sure the "Limit ERPM with negative current" is not checked or turned on.

You do need to go though all the settings in the Vesc or BLDC tool, which ever you are using.
Even with a ready made board, if it uses Vescs or Focbox's.

If you’re not good with computers it might be better for you to make a post on https://www.electric-skateboard.club (it’s a different site, check out the .club part). 

People from enertion are often pretty quick to help you over there if you have a serious problem like yours. This site (.builders) is more for people who are building their own board.

Wow! 2 broken ribs and a fractured elbow? Damn! I guess it could have been a lot worse so at least you're safe my man..you will heal..I had a few falls myself and screwed up my shoulders and arm..E-boards no matter how good or bad they are a huge risk when we get on them regardless of make...it's the cost of wanting to ride and have fun in life..don't give up the hobby get well and back on the board, the Raptor 2 is a great board, I have one myself and have never experienced the issue you had but I noticed Carl fixed it for you which is great...I also have the Carvon EVO 4WD which is even crazier than the Raptor 2 way faster with more torque and I'm 62 years old yet yesterday I hit 65km/h or 40.6m/h on the streets lol I do crazy shit like that too not thinking what if...but I won't live forever so the time to enjoy life is now...here is my close-up super-fast ride https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY79d50Ji04&lc=z22ytzvzcvrnglpae04t1aokgkznyke2pys1udcfa00qrk0h00410.1530928936594232

## \#31 Posted by: CarlCollins Posted at: 2018-07-07T12:38:05.761Z Reads: 132

@BigBrit

It's not isolated from the beginning, multiple factors are involved in the case 
1: Due to change in settings by user 
2: Due to vibrations, board shorts or connection reset 
3: Due to loose connection of wires, memory reset

Etc

So there was a fault with my battery causing my R2 to cut out like it was sent my board away been waighting for over 3 weeks and going to be waighting even longer as Enertions RA doesn't even stock spare batteries so have to waight even longer for it to get delivered from china what a absolute joke..

I feel you’re pain buddy, I’ve been on the same boat🤦🏻‍♂️ Going on 3 months without my raptor problem after problem,. the enertion support team is great but dealing with the parts is a very slow process, they should offer life time warranty since by the time you get replacement parts you’re 1 year warranty would expire..

Yeah mate not wrong weeks or months of having it or not running properly due to manufacturer faults and then the warranty runs out just doesn't make sense to me brother and im the same issue arfter issue with my R2 very frustrating .

If you complain and ask, I think enertion will extend warranty period for the parts delays.

@ZEEGREWAR
Let me add something.
There are many factors involved in the repair time.
1: Normal Repair time is 2 weeks (Working Days only) after the delivery of the board when it is at RA's place.
2: There are having multiple boards to repair so the new repair is never going to observed immediately after delivery. It take some time
3: All of RA's are fully stock with replacement items but battery's are hard to ship, so we have to source it from China if there isn't left any for them.

**Note:** I know it's quite frustrating to wait but we are doing as best as we can to solve the issues.

About warranty extension, we might consider that if repair takes longer that 2 weeks (working days only)

This problem started happening after I took it on some sidewalks for a fairly long distance. It was enough vibration to make the trucks loose in the 3/8'' bolts (I tightened these as soon as I noticed). I feel like repetitive bumps in the sidewalk may have knocked some wires loose when the trucks became loose. Now, it seems that the board will cut out soon after I have been going really fast in R-Spec mode. One time, it cut out as I was accelerating in R-Spec mode. This was effectively, a rapid deceleration that threw me off my board. Fortunately, I was able to catch my self in the form of a very high impact sprint. 

I was advised by customer service to take a picture of the inside of my board. Unfortunately, I will be moving around a lot in the short term and do not know when I will have a chance to take it apart. 

Prior to the power cutting out, I also noticed that the board has never gotten past 85%-87% charge on the battery even though it has been plugged in all night. This, I think, is a separate issue, but I think it may still be relevant.

@boonem1992
Looks like we can fix this easily,
You have to do the following things?
1: Update the Unity to the latest firmware
https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000774196-How-to-Update-the-Unity-for-a-Raptor-2-1-or-DIY-Board-VIA-Android-OR-Windows-PC
 
2: Remove the servo cable from the receiver, reposition it, resecure it by applying hot glue.
3: Calibrate your remote using FOCBOX UI
4: For battery, if you have a multimeter, test the output voltage and let me know.

I am having the same problem. The board just stops after about 5 minutes of use.

I think Enertion boards is out of business.  I cannot get through to them at all and I see here that most people cannot get in touch so it seems that they have just gone away. 

Bummer!

Hey @glyphiks - thanks for the response.  I am in Los Angeles, California. I just wrapped up working for the year so right now I have a little bit of time on my hands to start experimenting with the board to see if I can be more specific with what is happening.

If you have any suggestions on what to do please don't hold back. :grin: 

Cheers,

Suggest joining the new forum we don't know how long this will be maintained the new forum is community sponsored and primarily maintained by a few relatively small builders who do this as a hobby and side business so shouldn't suffer the same fate as this forum at least for the foreseeable future.  (new forum is on "esk8 news" site)

Regarding the issue with the batteries/BMS, with a multimeter you can determine if the voltage coming out of the battery looks right/wrong and if the voltage coming out of the BMS looks right/wrong (and do other diagnostics with the ESC) to pin down where the problem lies and replace the appropriate parts.
