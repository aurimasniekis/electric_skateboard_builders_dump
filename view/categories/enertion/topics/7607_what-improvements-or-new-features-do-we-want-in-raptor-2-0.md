Somethings I would like. No particular order
- Settings to VESC on the fly to allow for adjustments to brake,  speed etc. On phone app would be good.  Go Jacob. 
- A remote that allows for adjustment to different speed settings.  Say beginner,  intermediate and STIG. Just allows nubby's to use it because the leaning curve takes a bit of time if yourve never ridden none if these things out of the box. 
-With the change of the on/off  push button to flick switch and issues with some turning it off with foot.  Maybe it could it be rocated to bottom side with heavy duty chrome push button with blue led ring light..
-charging port moved to side, but will need the waterproof cap.  Might need to stay on top. 
-USB port.  For charging remote or phone or other accessory.  Light. 
-I like the thumb throttle,  but ths remote needs to be more robust and feel more solid in hand.  Current one susceptible to damage easily. 
 - Love the carbon deck. Kick tail guard screwed in with flush screws would be nice. Ppl are keeping on those edge guards.  Someone should come up with a cleaner looking one.  The edges are susceptible to knocks and damage to corners. 
-Maybe different design for grip tape.  Id like to see less grip tape over the beautiful CF. Know you need the grip though.  Also e centre part needs to be linked as it comes off.  Might help a little with staying on. Maybe the Enertion symbol on deck would be better than name.  Understand branding though. 
-Offer Abec 11 83mm 75A durometer as option.  I think alot of owners will appreciate it and maybe less issues.
-USB port. 
-Nice built in rear led light would be good to warn drivers. 
-Handle needs to be slightly deeper to allow fingers in there and rounded edges as the current one cuts into your hand slightly when carrying it for any period.
- Battery option for air travel. Smaller size space cell that also can connect to another one to give full capacity when we arrive at the desitinarion.

All of the above are minor.. The Raptor 1.0 is an awesome achievement so far and I know it will only get better. Hope I dont want to replace it soon.

But given its fairly modular like Onloop has promoted.  Most of the above things I could change if option offered like new remote with settings.

First that comes up in my mind would be:
- adjust your bottom plate to host decent inserts so you could screw your vesc's in tight and not sticking out from the rear.
-Adjust the rear in a way like for instance @longhairedboy uses in his deck builds. Get the motor connectors embedded in the carbon fibre with leads and plugs to the vescs, so all is interchangeble without glue/soldering/cutting...
-A click system for the lid to come of easily 
-A compartment for the battery rather than the velcro which makes u bend the spacecell
-I'm guessing if a 12mm belt dual should be an option.
-design a led kit that's optional but embedded with the deck

Tell me if I'm being ridiculous :smile:

- quality grip tape (the one on the Raptor is too fine imo)
- softer wheels

Everything else is called above.

I don't want to open Padoras box (again), but maybe a color choice... I'M SORRY

I'd like to see the following features added:

* a beer holder. It needs to use piezo-electric cooling to keep the bottle cold, should probably add a whole new P group just to get the needed watt hours for this. 
* Follow me mode. When i get off the board and walk through the store, i don't want to have to carry it. It should just be able to follow me and match my pace. 
* red kevlar. Forget the carbon. Lets go dyed kevlar fabric instead, and a corinthian leather grip surface so i can ride in my socks. 
*  25 watt per channel 4 speaker bluetooth audio, it can run off the same subsystem as the beer cooler. Needs to be 100% future proof and iphone 6S compatible. this would also pause the audio intermittantly to tell you how fast you are going and make suggestions about where to get a slurpee. 
* wifi hotspot and data plan
* air bag equipped trucks for a smoother ride
* high discharge rate parachute pack for emergency slow downs. 
* road side assistance subscription package
* theft protection service that automatically shuts down your board remotely and triggers a GPS beacon and calls 911 with the location, then calls you as well.  It can use Morgan Freeman's voice in the synthesizer. 
* grip made from the crushed bottles of only the finest Russian vodka punched into glass powder by Putin's bare fists. 
* retractable Co2 grappling hook for making tight turns at high seeds. 
* a locking compartment to put my gun in. Everyone in America has guns and we take them everywhere because you never know when the terrorists will drop down from obama's terror-copter. 

I'm sure i'll think of some more later.

More or less everything was said, i feel though there needs to be an order of things. Lets be real all those improvements are impossible in a reasonable timeframe. The biggest 3 things for me personal to stick with evolve in the future are the following:
- Speed settings
- Various wheel set up's (size of wheel, Abecs etc and even AT)
- Hub motors.( as a choice)

I like several of @Skitzor suggestions. 12mm belts for dual would be nice. 15mm for mono...? Running motor wires through the deck should be doable...then you could safely eliminate one riser and probably make it a softer riser. Improvement of both look and feel. Flywheels would be nice, but I probably wouldn't offer them if I'm @onloop...too much of a pain to carry low margin inventory.

I'm purely focussing on a truely modular build.
The wires shouldn't run trough the deck but just from the back of the raptors 'belly'. Now the bullet connectors are straight soldered on the vesc, and these together glued in the openings at the back. Which makes repairs a hassle...

Running wires through the deck is actually a good modular solution. Plug in a VESC on one and a motor on the other...change out a bad VESC or motor with minimal hassle. I'm speaking as someone who's replaced a bad VESC in my raptor dual and built a board with LHB style channels running through the board...Much easier to work on the board I built. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/433ca53c39b8d077c93c7885204bd2f16a0d74bb.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Should also mention, this board is MUCH more comfortable that my raptor...even with 83mm flywheels on the raptor.

Woow, self-made? Looks awesome ! I thought it was a raptor in the first picture
Both are good options, but I guess embedding the connectors in the back would be a much easier interpretation for the raptor 2.0.

Thanks. Yes, self made, Drang Dasher 37 deck. Basically a long range (SC pro4) wooden raptor mono. Back to topic...I'd like to see a wider kick tail on raptor 2.0. Seems like my back foot is always getting fatigue on longer rides and I think it's because I've always got 1/4 foot hanging off the board.

Needs a high powered chick magnet, and side car (or trailer) option for when the chick magnet is set to "attract" mode. I'm married, so I'd have to set it to "repel" mode, but my rides would still be much more pleasant without having to outrun a baby duck style trail of screaming admirers everywhere I go. How come nobody talks about this? :laughing:

A refined control/remote system that's been over-engineered with safety in mind. A system with a dedicated second connection just in-case the first one fails. A system that allows for switching between different power modes. A "reduced" power mode that still understands when you're on an incline and provides the extra torque normally reserved for higher power modes.

+1 for the 12 or 15mm dual drive Raptor.
So there is nothing that Enertion offers right now to upgrade a dual drive to 12mm without having to cut the trucks?
It would only take trucks and a 12mm kit...right?

it would also take shorter motors. Twin 6355s aren't going to fit on the same 10" 184mm chopped truck with dual 12mm belts.

I've switched to enertion mounts with a single motor setup and much prefer the design. I have not tried running dual motors with enertion mounts but they sit in roughly the same spot so I see no reason why it wouldn't work

When @tarzan gets a chance to find some spare time off work hes going to make an awesome new handle from a  solid aluminium block. Way over the top. Dont ask him hiow much as it will be ridiculus. He can do it as he has the material and the machinery. Oh and with Raptor logo on it.

Raptor handle is definitely not comfortable to use. I thought I would remove it the instant I saw it in person, but, aside from it being uncomfortable on your fingers, I actually like using it instead of carrying the board like a normal skateboard. Keeps my hands from touching the grip tape and if the bottom of the board is dirty, it keeps my clothes clean.

Rode my Raptor for about 45 minutes today and **accidentally turned the battery off with my foot 3 times** before I had to force myself to not move my back foot...

SUGGESTION FOR NEXT RAPTOR: do something with the battery switch so you can't turn it off with your foot. Duh. 

Is there a 'sliding' switch I could replace it with instead of a 'rocker' switch? I feel like that would fix the issue. You could still slide the switch off with your foot but much less easily than the current switch. 

Ideally, I think the switch (and DC port) should be on the side of the board. Both the top and bottom of the board are more susceptible to water than the side. And then you could use any style switch without worry about accidentally turning the board off midway through riding. I thought it was my Winning remote the first 2 out of 3 times, only to realize it was my foot ha**strong text**

I'd love to be able to lock my board up outside of places instead of carrying it around. 

I was thinking of using an assortment of screw heads for the lid (torx, phillips, pentalobe, etc.) so a potential thief would need a pretty robust assortment of tools to remove the lid and steal the battery quickly. 

A lock for the lid that uses a key would be nice. 

Or maybe I'll just insure it and/or throw GPS inside of it and call it a day.
