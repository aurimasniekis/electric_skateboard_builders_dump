Hey Everyone,

I recently received my Raptor 2, but I had to think if I could ever ride again (I broke my 5th metatarsal in the Navy last year and it is not properly healing).  Ultimately, I need another surgery which would mean its months away from me riding again.  So, I am offering my board for sale.  It is absolutely brand new, other than me opening the box. I have not even turned it on. 

I know a lot of people are waiting for their orders.  PM me if you are interested and I will try to ship it as fast as I can. Christmas is right around the corner and is the perfect gift.  

1,600 plus shipping.  I am located in DC.

I would be willing to come try this out. I’m seeing retail for $1500. Since it is used I would offer &$1000 if it is legit.

@Patwrya 

1. It’s not used. He clearly states that and the pictures prove it...

2. If not a fake, and worth well over $1000usd..

Who is “he”?
  It is not straight out of the factory. So it is “used”. Would they be willing have it seen in person?

Having it taken out of the box and a photo taken does not make it "used" it is in brand new condition

it's technically "second-hand" and "new." You're getting a new product, but not directly from the manufacturer

Actually 1600 is more than I could buy it for. $1500 is almost the retail price and since it is new I would think that sounds very fair

Enertion Warranties are transferable. 1600 is well worth it if you can afford it. And why would anyone wanna return an Enertion board?

You can't really compare it to "retail" though. Because if you bought it from Enertion, you go to the back of the bus with hundreds ahead of you.  I haven't been following the updates, but I'm sure you'd be lucky to get it by spring 

In that sense, it's worth whatever someone is willing to pay. Because it exists today, not months from now
```

## \#13 Posted by: Mikenopolis Posted at: 2017-12-19T04:10:05.772Z Reads: 376

Yup. You basically pay $100 more than current retail to get it now versus getting it 6 million years from now

This board is worth $1600 or more. Do not sell it for less, people have waited over 1 year to get this board, so a fresh man comes over and offers $1000 for it when the waiting time to a get a new one is some around 3 and 5 months?, just keep it there you will sell it pretty soon.

Unfortunately,  I can not let anyone ride it before they purchase the board.  I will gladly show proof of purchase and everything that came with it.  But if you decide not to buy it, the board becomes used.  You can turn it on and verify everything works. 

I can also meet anyone around the DC metro area if people are near DC

If no one takes it
And you split up the parts
I might take some
Obviously you won’t split it and it’s stupid because it’s an amazing board and I would love to try one
But that’s an option
```

## \#30 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2017-12-22T03:28:52.561Z Reads: 272

So he splits the parts, sell you the BMS and now he has an incomplete Raptor 2, that does not even work, now he will try to sell the remaining parts for the next two years, maybe sooner if has no more option but to sell them at extremely low price. 

That's a great idea!

I was just reading from their website under T& C's - Warranty Transfers "Warranties are only transferable for Raptor 2 pre-order customers who are on-selling their pre-order before delivery of products has been received." 

I'll try reaching out to chat and see if they are willing to transfer the warranty on an unused board. 

Idk @onloop himself could comment on whether or not it would transfer.

IIRC there's a 20% administrative fee to transfer the warranty, plus a 20% rewarrantying fee on top of that.  Then another 20% because fuck you!

I bought an R2 (unopened) from member here after he took delivery. Was able to transfer warranty. Original owner had to initiate transfer (w/in 60 days from shipment) with customer service using email registered with purchase. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/2/a273e0f3696a5a1e21d581ceaae2720df09f84b0.jpeg" width="281" height="500">

Hi am also selling mine if anyone is interested.
I'm based in the UAE - have recently broken my foot (not Raptor related) and am also moving away in the next few months.

The Raptor 2 is brand new, with new set of out-wheels. In mint condition.

Not sure how shipping it works over here but happy to do with the right offer.

Do not let some noob you don't know show up to ride your new board unless he put's exactly $1600 in your hands first. Also let him know that when he sends it sailing out from under him you'll be keeping the money.
