My R2 has had nothing but problems from day 1 

I've been sent parts for most things but some things still are getting fooked up due to a lack of experience (not good at DIY) and now my board doesn't run at all 

4mths in a year warranty no support (am I that cheeky, probably). Such a shame its a great board when working. 

I need a local DIY expert to fix my board, willing to pay for time, materials and training/education

PM me locality and average costs

Thanks Carl - I have and have also been very annoying to the point of sending multiple emails having lost faith in what is an excellent product that I'm proud to be an owner of. 

However I'm a rider not a builder and when trying to fix stuff im making it worse, sadly to say (just the way it is).

So did get all those issues taken care of by enertion?

I had my Raptor 2 for 1 week now, I'm having a blast, not the fastest board I have but a really nice feeling to ride on it, ultra stable.
