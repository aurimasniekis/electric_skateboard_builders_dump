Had this issue since day one with my focbox app/raptor 2.1 

See the screenshot I attached. When I max the speed on my raptor with the wheels off the ground it only displays 39km/h. Shouldn't it show something more like 50? I think something is going wrong with the measurement of distance somewhere because I get the Wh/Km reading up wayy too high

how do I solve?
