Thought I would start a new thread on all the good stuff abouf the riding experience on the Raptor. Someone can do the reviews.

Have had the busiest week so far and its not over. Still have a deadline to get out tomorrow. Was at work from 7am to 8pm. Got home, changed, put on some safety gear, gave the remote a charge. Then grabbed the Raptor and went off for a ride.

Now it was already past dusk. No lights on skateboard and had to rely on the street lights.

After a rapid 30min sprint on the bike path, I was sweating like anything. Stress gone for the moment.

The board has so much power. I have a dual motor unit and its friken scary in a good way. I only weigh 60kg and keen to beat Onloops top speed.  Still trying to find the sweet spot of this thing both in terms of riding position and acceleration. The throttle is really sensitive and just wants to go. Starting the trigger while the board is moving is best from start off.  Its still really jerky as I try to feather the throttle at while at speed. 

I think I'm just not going fast enough yet. Tonight was probably not a good idea as I was litterally riding blind and just waiting to hit a stick or crack that I couldnt see. Made it home un skathed.

Cant wait to get out again. But in daylight.

It's great to hear some positive news... 

The Raptor is best when travelling between 35 - 45km/h... one of it's primary purposes is a high speed single person commuting vehicle. It loves long open stretches. Try to average 25km/h or higher to maximise range.

Of course it works well at lower speed too but the torque output will drop you on your arse in a second if you pull the trigger too hard.. 

I believe most people will adapt to this setup after 4 or 5 hours of riding. Maybe less.  

Its a process of training your finger, brain and body to work with the Raptor timings. Of course you will pull that trigger to hard once or twice before you have your posture perfect. You might land on your arse. Eventually you will learn the subtle timings and adjust accordingly.

It won't take too long to tame the Raptors and everyone will be ripping hard and feeling very confident.

At first a big Thank You to Jason for making these things reality!
Sadly it is raining all day in my hometown right know and I weren't able to do a long ride.
Before I describe my riding experience with the Raptor you should know that I'm not very experienced with electric skateboards. I have owned an Evolve Bamboo but it wasn't powerfull enough to pull me up the hills where I usually like to go longboarding. Plus it had sidewinder trucks...... :smiley: so I sold it.
My skill level in terms of longboarding is some kind of advanced. I'm able to do slides and can ride a board pretty hard and save. Okay that's what I would have said before my test ride.
Now the ride itself....
Because of the bad weather I had to find a dry spot to ride and the first thing which came to my mind: Uhh at work they have huge halls and a lot of space.... Yes I need a new definition for "a lot of space" because a ran out of road pretty fast :smile:
First attempt!? Well you have seen Xusias video? Exact the same what happened to me. I donÂ´t know what I expected but for sure I wasnÂ´t prepared for this launch.Â´
Second one. Pushed one or two times jumped on, got my normal riding position and hit the trigger. Again the board accelerated faster than my 70 kg meat and overtook me in a blink of an eye. Easy, no contact to pavement all good, but the dual Raptor gained my respect.
Third attempt. Some dry training with the joystick before to get a feeling and on the board again. One or two Flintstone pushes, on the board and now smooth operation with the stick. Great it worked and felt amazing. So much power that I felt like a pudding on the roof of a racecar witch does a 6 min round on the Nordschleife racetrack.... Important change in my riding style was to spread my feed much more. 
Soon I started to feel more confident and started to hit the trigger harder. Damn that thing has some serious power. It really scares me! I mean in a good way but that is just crazy. I have no worries to climb the hills I have planned. Will be a piece of cake!
With more throttle I noticed pretty quick the limitation of my test track. The longest straight had maybe 200 meters and four different types of soil with dust over it. Some parts were very slippery and I got whellspin while accelerating. Maybe IÂ´m able to shoot the first eSk8 gymkhana :smiley:
IÂ´ll post again when I have done some more testing but for now IÂ´m more then impressed.

I must say this thing is definitely built for advanced riders. It's my first Eboard but I figured it out in a matter of 10 minutes or so. I've been hitting full throttle frequently before it fell part. (Long story I think I just got a bad one) I've clocked myself going 23.4 on a low charge and when it's full charge it definitely has a bit more torque... Probably 25-26mph?

http://youtu.be/tF6TdS46s8o I  clocked it after the video was taken, so I'm only going like 20mph in that. I would clock it again with a full charge and better video but, it's currently out of commission.

@Tarzan So glad your expectations of the board have been met.  I feel the same way about the experience.  Now its just a matter of getting some more time on the board. I have tomorrow off work and its going ti be 29deg C. Cant wait to take it out again.

Thnks Jason.  Having never been on an Eboard. Like with learning to ride a bike,  you  have to find the right balance and get comfortable with the speed and brakes.  I feel the same way except this time on learning on a Ducati in comparison. Need to just get more time on the board.

Second day with the raptor and I'm more than happy! I have done some rides today und feel much more confident with the board and the remote.

This was the last run I made today.
This thing is freaking awesome!
Very stable on high speeds and enough torque to go up any hill. Yes like advertised from enertion ðŸ˜œ
The battery had 25% left when I came home, because I haven't done the changes to the VESC regarding the low voltage cut off I was carful to the end.
The range is greate considering that I live in a really hilly part of Germany.
The first run I did today was a five km hill climb with an average of 15% so quite a lot. I hit a speed up to 40 km/h and overtook some kids on there scooters ðŸ˜„
After a cigarette on the top they arrived as well and asked me where they can get one (I gave them a enertion card). The battery had 40% left and downhill I generated 8% back. In my opinion quite a lot!
Maybe I'm not the usual customer by kicking these expensive fun mashine to the limit on the first day, but I do it for science ðŸ˜‰

Definatelty starting to get use to this weapon. The controller is still sensitive to use, but its set to be very responsive. Im sure in a few months the speed will just become normal and I will crave more speed. Now trying to find smoother bike paths and roads.

Wow! Even more fun than I imagined. Hope I don't jinx myself, cause so far I'm extremely pleased with my raptor dual. Only put a few miles on my board, but so far no dropped remote signals, nothing coming loose, no battery issues. I wouldn't mind a more linear acceleration profile with the remote and may change my settings with BLDC, but even as is it isn't terrible. I suspect I'd be comfortable after a few days even if changing the settings weren't an option. Took it easy today and other than a couple accidental wheelies, had no issues controlling speed up or down hills. I actually felt more limited by the soft bushings than anything else...gonna swap those out this weekend. The torque really is amazing, I'm about 210lbs and could easily accelerate from 5ish mph to 15ish mph while going up a 15+% hill. So much fun!

Took the board out for a late ride after work to test our range and enjoy the clear Melbourne evening. Travelled around the bay in Elwood and SkKilda beach foreshore.

2hrs ride with 18% charge left. The regenerative breaking is really good. Distance about 24km. Trying to get that magical 30km thats been stated in spec. Still that is some great riding time and distance.

Had many rubber neckers as I pasted and alot of comments. @onloop should be happy because I got pulled over by a few people who wanted to know what it was and the details. Had some really good comments. Their all amazed as most people havent really seen eboards around Melbourne.

Some older guys were really impressed with the whole thing. Commented on the design and it looked great and alot of design had gone into into it.

Another guy looking for an eboard- boostered, stary, & evolve. Had done alot of research, but hadnt hear about the Enertion or Raptor. Let Him have a go. Told him to just get one. He wanted one with a good design. He didnt like the Evolve shape. so @onloop may have another order come his way.

Really enjoyed the ride last night as clear paths for the most part. Hammering fast in sections, so finally getting really comfortable with it.  

Note. ppl and runners that you pass from behind even when slow shit. themselves and give you the look. Whats with that. Bike riders do it all the time. Need a horn on the controller tomwarn them. Like a full on 100db horn should do it.

Yes, riding around is definitely the best advertisement.  People are amazed and curious every time I venture out on an e-board. I didn't know there was anyone in Melbourne with a Raptor. We should definitely organize a group skate, I'd love to try one out! I have a Boosted Dual Plus and several Evolve boards that I could bring along to compare.

Tried it again with more consistant fast speed and got around 20km range. There was alot more head wind on the return trip. Still excellent distance in my opinion. Down to 0%, but still some back up to get to a little more distance with regen braking. 10%.

It's great to read all these positives.  

This is a pretty costly product.  I just want it to work w/o any issues or tinkering with settings.  I'm an average consumer, not a DIY e-skate builder.  2 questions.

1) who are your US representatives for customer support?  I've heard you have one on the east and west coast, I'm on east coast.
2) What is the guaranteed delivery date if you order the raptor dual in April?

I'm thinking of buying one and doing a detailed review on my youtube channel (and a comparison to the very popular boosted dual plus that I own).

Great skate into the G and city today with @Mickyboy. Need to now build up a group to check out alot more of this City now. Had a go at all MB's eboards. Nice collection there and all different. Very impresed by the Boosted duals riding dynamic. Just needs more juice to bomb up those hills, and extra milage. Look forward to catching up again one day.

About 22.5km today. Battery down to 0%. Oddly when I let it settle it went back to 2% and then as soon as charger went on it was 18%. So theres still some mileage there to get home. From station to home 3.5km. 10min ride. This last bit was on 0% and regen braking. 1 half hours to charge to 100% with fast charger.

Hey @photorph

Use my @onloop to get my attention faster.. this forum is getting very active and becoming hard to keep on top of all the new replys.

To be honest... the Raptor is not a consumer grade product like a boosted board currently is.. It's best described as a prebuilt DIY board. Over time it will become polished and perfected... The difference between enertion & boosted is they took 12 months+ to finally release their products and had over 1 million worth of investment capital. They did the development behind closed doors.

The enertion raptor in some ways is a work in progress, however it will continue to be sold to early adopters and reiterated and refined over time. Same business model that tesla used with the model S. It was continuously evolving and being sold at the same time.

Some changes will be subtle some more obvious. None of the changes will directly disadvantage the early adopters, in most cases they will be sent new parts. Especially if it is a critical change. For example the newly developed lid that allows better RF signal.

My agents are members of this community. What info about them did you need exactly? 

Let me know if you have other questions.

@onloop, I do have a 3 questions.

1) What's the expected delivery date to US for orders placed in April for the raptor dual?  (let's say order is placed this upcoming week)
2) Another forum member here recommended the larger 10S4P space cell for more range, is this included with the new raptor dual or something additional?  If so what's the cost?
3) Did you have any of your customers reporting damage to motors?  My boosted dual plus has metal covers that protect the motors, those get scratched up quite a bit.  The raptor's motors seem to be totally exposed to the elements from the pictures shown.
```

1) I just got totally screwed by my wheels factory, they made all my wheels with the wrong logo colours... this is likely to cost a few weeks (they are already 90 days overdue). At the moment our production is about 30 per month, but only if we have all the stock. So if you order in April, expect about a 30-day lead time. However at any moment in time this can be delayed due to us getting screwed by a supplier. So if you want an exact time frame i would have to say 30-60 days.

2) we don't have that option available yet. we do sell it separate though. this would require you to modify it. http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro4-electric-skateboard-battery/

3) it is possible to damage your motor, normally that will happen if you try to ride up a gutter that has a 1inch+ step. Approaching from 45deg angle is recommended. Normally riding on a path or road won't be an issue.

Just tried Boosted dual plus against the Raptor Dual. They are very differebr boards. The throttle and ride on the boosted is smooth. In comparison the Raptor is just like a beast. Its really fast and has great range. The ride isnt as smooth as the deck is carbon so wont take the bumps as well as the Boosted.  Raptor is made to get somewhere fast. They are just different rides. 

If your concerned about distance travelled with Raptor just get another space cell and take it with you or get the fast charger and use that to get you the extra distance. This just cancels out the range issue.

Your not going to be able to get over the shortfall of that the Boosted can only do about 6-8km range. Im still riding around doing circles around it. Now get the Raptor Mono and youll also have great speed and extra range again.

If you watch out for high kerbs and bad paving as per Onloops advice the motors should be fine from serious damage. Ive only has some minor scratches to motor mounts on the very bottom of them.

I think the cost is comparable with other such boards. Dont think there is anything on the market with its spec unless you make it yourself. To put it in perspective look up Revoll. Now thats pricey and you still need to pay any taxes and shipping. No help if you have any problems as his ones still only just getting off the ground.

Dam Ive just highjacked my own thread. @Photorph please start your own thread.

I like the boosted dual plus I have, but hate the range and wish it had more max speed.  It peaks out at 22 mph and then coasts at 20 mph full throttle, which feels very slow to me since I've done downhill before.  I'm hoping the raptor can keep the claimed 27 mph continuously.  

Thanks Dedbny and onloop, I think I'm going to order the raptor this month and I'll take onloops word that I'll get it within 30-60 days.   I'll be doing a high production value comparative review of the boosted dual plus, raptor dual, and the inboard m1 (which my friend is due to get soon).  I think it will be the only review on youtube comparing the top 3 skateboards in the market currently (in my opinion).  I really want to be able to say that the raptor dual wins out, but I'll be honest in my review.  Will have to include delivery time, customer service, top cruising speed, real world ranges, ride quality, smoothness, and build quality/durability in my review.  

Alright enough thread hijacking.  I'll start my own thread once I have all 3 boards at hand.

So I'll just be waiting on the raptor to do my comparative video.  I'm hoping the raptor dominates them in performance!  I'll be posting my review on this forum, and on a few reddit E board subs including boosted board's sub and the general E board sub.  I am sure the video will get views by almost anyone who is interested in E-boards.  I'll start another thread soon, as soon as I get my hands on the inboard and raptor dual.

Ok people need chill and be patient. I just got my raptor back and I don't know what Damon did but the thing is rocking the streets. Not a single problem. I'm a advanced rider and can't ask for much more. I'm riding in town and people are freaking out on me. There used to seeing long boarders going down hill as fast as I go up hill. I am truly happy. Thank you longhairedboy and Jason for less beast of a board

So glad your rocking the Raptor. Since getting mine back  my board is totally different. Taking it out any time I can and virtually every day. Even now during my lunch break and taking it down the river bike paths here near the city.

I'm getting chased down by car and guys on bikes trying to catch up to me to find out what it is.

Roads and paths arent great where I am. I feel more comfortable at full speed when I know section isn't likely to have large obstructions or potholes. Its going to hurt if you hit sonething at speed.

I hope not to have to brake suddenly at speed. I usually brake in advance as to where  I think I need to. So only throttle braking and doing the lean back just before stopping to avoid flying forward.

Do you ride with a full face often? I have one but my d+ feels way too slow to warrant it. I do have a lot of hills in my commutes though, so I wear it more often if it's not too hot out. 

I'm just thinking of situations where a car pulls out in front of you unexpectedly and you need to break. Or you're behind one and they break suddenly. Breaking on a d+ isn't that great but it is predictable. Just trying to get a feel for how aggressive it would be in comparison. I'd imagine if more torque = harder breaking the raptor would probably send me flying if I'm not prepped lol

Cars are not a Raptors friend. For that matter anyone on a skateboard at speed like a cyclIst has no hope. My raptor use to have aggresive braking. Fine for more sudden stopping, but still no chance you being able to stop suddenly. Dont know what you are trying to ask, Your going to come off.

I ride in traffic sometimes, I keep a consistent speed and enough distance to break in anticipation of cars slowing down. I guess what I'm asking is when coming to a fast stop, what is the (relative) breaking distance coming from top speed (or the fastest you've used the breaks on). 

I know with my board now I have on max power it can take a good while to stop, basically turns into a slide / run off if I don't have enough time.

Without actaully measuring braking distance. The braking distance will be more than you can stay on the board during braking. The board may stop in say 5-10m whatever, but the problem is thers nothing holding you back from that momentum you are travelling at. Hope that makes sense. You just have to be prepared for any obstacles Full safety gear required at those speeds.

I can probably answer that for you. Owning a D+ Myself and having ridden a couple of Raptors including Dedbny's I can more or less compare braking performance between the two. The D+ is almost perfect for braking in my opinion, and a properly calibrated Raptor is comparable. You can adjust the Raptor to stop a little quicker again than the D+ but you're pretty limited by the laws of physics and the available grip you have. Also if you make the brakes too powerful or touchy  it can tend to throw you off if your not fully prepared. I don't think you're ever going to stop as well as a bike. You have to be more cautious and prepared instead. Just my 2c.

Thanks for the back up reply. Skateboarding around cars is jusf dangerous. You really need to adjust speed to surroundings. If its clear go full throttle  if the road ahead is good, otherwise slow to a safer speed.

Thanks for the reply. I wasn't planning on depending on the breaks entirely, just mainly to assist with getting to a lower speed to hop off. I'll definitely try to avoid putting myself in danger, shit just happens sometimes as you can imagine. 

Btw how is the grip tape on the raptor? Due to the design I don't see how you could swap it at all or is there a special process? Kind of concerned if it isn't as coarse and grippy as Vicious grip tape. I already put that on my d+ and I'm only going 20.

One fall at speed....afterwards I am sure you will never be seen on a board without protective gear.  

I've hit speeds above 30mph on a regular longboard, never fell.  I did have one fall on a boosted board at less than 20 mph when a car pulled out in front of me and there were a few potholes I couldn't avoid, I was only wearing a helmet and no pads/gloves.  Helmet saved my head, and all the areas where I didn't have protection got jacked up.  Here's my right hand post wipe out.

Very thin leather and a good throttle control in the finger. Velcro straps on the wrists and of course sliding pucks. Right now I only use one puck but @chaka is hopefully making one with a integrated remote near future.
If you have done some downhill you would never ride without gloves because you would know that these are the most useful item on your safety equipment. (Of course you should wear a helmet too!)

Anyway back to the topic of this thread.
It is working very good and holds up some mean treating.
I have done a sweet ride on the Raptor today which i like to share because I'm very pleased with it.

I don't know how correct these GPS measurement is but that long downhill section is almost straight and I get a ridicules speed down there. The breaks still wok good like you can see on the graph. I slow down a couple of times in this section because there are some mean potholes and cracks.

Question for you, have you had any issues with the exposed motors? One of my concerns is that the exposed motors may be more likely to take hits when going up onto sidewalks or over other rough surfaces that could hit it. 

And if something were to happen to your motor, is it covered under the warranty? @onloop 's TOS on his website seem to suggest that all electrical component's have a very limited warranty, and stuff that breaks from "extreme riding or overuse". Wondering what really counts as extreme and if it takes a hit how much do we have to pay to replace?

>If the product has a manufacturing fault we will replace it free of charge once we are satisfied that the fault is as a result of manufacturing and NOT from extreme riding or overuse

The first thing what hits something is the mount. You'll learn quick which obstacles are okay and which aren't.
If you hit a sidewalk very hard with the motor you can damage it even it takes a bigger hit you might think.
Personally I think Enertion is forgiving with his Raptor customers and they'll send you the spare parts for free with a "be carful mate."
At least that's my experience.

Ive taken my Raptor on many different paving conditions.  The mounts have some minor scratches.  Motor has some very minor scratches as well.  As @onloop has said previously you need to go up kerbs on an angle,  but really you dont want to go down stepped concrete paving say 30mm or more.  You would slow down for these or stop.  I always thought the motors should hang from back,  but assume due to the kick tail it would more likely get hit at the back.  So I think the position of the motors is good.  Also makes it less obvious you have motors there.  Everyone is surprised when I tell them theres 2 motors under the back wheels.

Another thing, if you are comparing to the boosted you used to have...

The wheels on the raptor I found out are much bigger than the 75 mm wheels on the boosted, so there is actually more clearance compared to how much the boosted had.   My boosted's motor mounts got totally scratched up just after a couple of rides.   So that higher clearance is a plus for the raptor.   On the flipside, if you do get any damage by rocks or anything like that, it is going to go to the motor directly since the motor doesn't have an enclosure.

Hmm, makes sense. I was just concerned about having to be super mindful of the surfaces I go up. I was thinking it would affect the number of things I could go over, but if the main thing is going down from a taller spot then I guess I should be able to manage. I change from street to sidewalk a lot but always use the handicap decline.

Motors should be easy to replace,  but you would need a heat gun to melt the hotglue at the junction where cables go into enclosure. Ill try and post some pics of my motor and mounts so you can see condition. The things arent going to say scratchless for long.  Theyre alot less susceptible then boosted.  Ive seen them on various vids and one myself as @Photorph says.

Put many miles on the raptor in Los Angeles. So far my biggest concern is the odd extra large lip on driveways or handi ramp...I usually hop off or take them at an angle. Going down is a different story due to the kick tail...riding off curbs isn't an issue, but still something I usually avoid. I do worry about the occasional sand patch I can't avoid while riding beach paths, but so far it hasn't been an issue. 

In keeping with the thread topic: went on a epic 9 mile night ride with my buddy who has the mono raptor. It was my first long ride with another eboarder and man was it a blast! Hauling ass through alleys and along the beach paths at night, popping off curbs, hammering the throttle on some open stretches...felt like a teenager sneaking out after curfew...truly epic. 

@onloop can be polarizing for various comments and views, but the man built one hell of a board! I will forever be grateful to him for the introduction to eboarding.

I ordered last week so my wait may last until the end of summer...may be getting another board in addiition so I'm not boardless the whole summer.

WE know it's pointless, but people that see that vid may not realize just how amazing the dual is. For instance, look at this statement that was on the subreddit:

>does anyone else get the "quantity vs quality" vibe one this one? To me the boosted boards is a lot like the iphone, it was designed with the end user in mind, **not flashy numbers that only look good on a computer screen.** 

This guy has no idea that the numbers flaunted are legit, and just how scary powerful the board is as you guys describe. To see the d+ get left behind in **torque**, it's strongest selling point, would let people know that it is no longer a reason to buy the d+.

Of course there is, it'd take some time but doable. 

My point was right now the d+ to most people (not in the DIY community or aware of the wide array of other eboards) is known as *the best* when it comes to power. They couldn't be more wrong of course, but they'd need to see _evidence_  that it isn't. Comparing it to the dual would silence them. Then they'd wonder why they're paying $1500 for a board that is nearly 10mph slower when they could be getting one with more than 4 times the range. Though right now I don't think Jason need a lot more orders when he still has a lot to fill, it would be nice to see.

True, keep the goodies to ourselves : p

I felt the same way initially when I got the BB, NO one around had one in my area. I felt like a unicorn in a sense. Cool feeling. Then after a while I started feeling embarrassed when I started noticing just how slow I was really going once I got used to the speed. Also how often cars try to speed around me. All of this ultimately made me want more out of an eboard.

I will admit though, I honestly don't want the raptor to spread like wildfire, most people can't handle being able to go 20, let alone 25+.. There's always someone getting really badly injured on the BB sub, couldn't imagine what it would be like if they had this board.

On a side note, if there are more comparison vids made, they should break the boards it into categories: commuters, high performance, portable, etc. Because one board can't do everything.

One thing I thought was really stupid was the lack of their own safety videos or any type of "quick start" type thing. They provide these in the form of a manual but of course very few read it. Much easier just to post the vids to their main channel and people would be more likely to watch. Make it even required when registering the board. 

Lol it's not so much about speed or torque differences (although they do play a role), but also the weight, battery life, deck, wheels, trucks, etc. So many different things that can make a board ideal for one thing but not for another.

Hey guys. I want to quickly throw something in:
Maybe it is not always about being or having something better than another person. 
Let those with BB or whatever enjoy themselves. They live of the brand, not the power or anything else on their board.
In the end everyone should enjoy themselves...
Though I understand the criticism/funny feedback to the power, range and so on of a finished BB board out of the shelf.

PS: ordered a dual Raptor myself, so Ill be shitting my pants sometime soon.

[quote="Dedbny, post:77, topic:1299"]
but you would need a heat gun to melt the hotglue at the junction where cables go into enclosure.
[/quote]

if you're referring to the raptor... you can actually just gently pull the phase leads back through the hole after disconnecting them from the vesc on the inside without melting the glue. You just have to use a slow, even pressure and not yank them. They'll pull through the glue and come out, and with some work they'll go back in as well. I've never had to use a heat gun to replace either the vesc or the motors, and i'm glad because i'd rather not heat up the resin on that carbon fiber too much. But i have added more black hot glue after the fact, so maybe you'll need it to replace the motor on one i've fixed if you ever come across one. Despite enjoying the business of fixing these under warrenty claims, i'd rather people were riding them. Every minute they're on my bench is a minute somebody isn't feeling the wind in their hair on some paved trail somewhere.

Make your video with the baords you have. We already know the Raptor dual will eat the Boosted Dual +. At the end of the day which is what Ive been saying is they each have their unique likes. And the dislikes are just the minor design or spec setup etc for each of the boards. The consumer comsumer is the winner here.

Do a GT one as a separate vid with comments back about the one on these. At end of day we just want content what ever it is.

The simplest most powerful video you could make to drive it home for non-DIY aware folks is to make similar  video like Jason did for the raptor mono vs d+ and do it with the raptor dual...WE know it is absolutely pointless but others who have never even looked into DIY will become aware and (those that like performance) will want to join the movement. The new d+ will be pretty similar in performance so you don't even need it since you have the old and specs for the new.

Just my two cents. As far as comparison videos, I don't think you need to include the old carbon in any unless you're comparing the new and old model alone. I'd value a GT vs Raptor Dual comparison though. Definitely make something, even if its none of the above...except for the Raptor c:

Actually it doesn't, it's the same caliber truck as the Boosted but rebranded lol. I put on Carver CX trucks which are meant for skateboards (very narrow) and I was fine, the sidewinders are technically the most unstable out of the bunch from what I've heard from QuadTheory. I think it appears that way because the Raptor deck is wider at the nose.

Of course, if you play with bushings no truck is abysmal when it comes to stability, carving is a whole other issue.

Its stable at speed. The truck shouldnt be left loose as youll get speed wobble. The kicktail reduces the possibility of a longer wheelbase, but that is the compromise isnt it. If the board gets so long you cant get the dam thing through doors.ðŸ˜€.  I thought the evolve carbon was too long, but you probbaly do get that stability by longer wheelbase. It sits lower. Was thinking of removing 1 of the risers on Raptor which Tarzan has done to lower ride height.

If you check out some of his videos with the space cell in a raptor. you'll see that it's already very compact. You need to add 10 more cells for 10s4p just will not fit with 2 vescs, a receiver, and wires in there in the current raptor deck.

i did ride the raptor today for the second time, before it was always raining.
it is such a nice feeling to carve on a flat street and you get the hang of it quiet fast even thought there is still a lot of room for improvement on my part. the first time the raptor felt so scary that i never even reached top speed but the second time i had no problem to ride at top speed (for more experienced riders a bit more speed might be fun in the long run).
Handling the remote is just like learning to drive stick at first a bit bumpy but real soon you will get the hang of it and it will become second nature. so all in all this is a really fun toy and i do think well wasted money :wink:

45kmh sounds really fast but if you are on a straight good and empty road it looses a lot of its scare factor but you are probably right about protection i was thinking about some downhill gear like debny posted in post 56 and i think i will get a tsg pass. 
bigger battery like 12 s would also make it faster but i would say it might be a bit easier just to use another gearing ratio even though with a higher gearing you loos torque but to be honest i would say that would not be a big problem with the raptor.

LOL yeah that's what I figure..I have a lot of stop and go in some of my commutes, I think honestly I could take a small hit in torque for higher top speed since I will not need all that power 24/7. I don't know anything about gear ratios but how drastic would slightly altering it be? Could it 1/2/3km/h faster by reducing the gearing the slightest amount possible?

I don't think I would try 12s, not looking to go anywhere near 60km/h like @Photorph :p Just thinking about slight increases to hit about 49-50km/h (this is already the theoretical max speed according to @onloop but it gets 45km/h IRL)

if i am right the gearing is 15/36 and a top speed of 45
so in theory if you would use 18/36 you would have a 20% top speed increase which would make 54 kmh
or 20/36 which would theoretically go 60kmh
but i do not know where the power limit of this motors is where they cant pust the board any faster.

@Jinra you are right, there is a small keyway and it is very easy to replace the pulley on the R-spec.   Just need a 2mm allen wrench and you're good to go.  

@Mr_Mahal It's not worth the effort to get more top speed, 27ish mph is pretty fast.  Compared to boosted it will be like a whole new sensation.  And any input you make is amplified, much more chances of getting speed wobbles at those high speeds also if you're not used to going that fast. That being said, it would be really simple to change the pulley.  I can take a picture and show you.  Just a matter of taking belt off, unscrewing one screw with a 2mm wrench, putting a new pulley that has that same size hole to put the screw in and you're good to go.  The only thing I don't know is if only enertion pulleys are made that way.  You will likely need DIY pulleys.  Anyway this motors are beasts, combined with the chaka vesc.... love it!!!

don't see how I could get tired of 45km/h coming form 32km/h that fast lol maybe 48km/h would suffice, any faster and I'd need leathers
[/quote]

Some riders cant get enough speed. You wont know till your on the board for long enough. When I did my 45km/hr test I did it on the Aus F1 GP ciircuit just a week prior to the real race while I still had access to the street circuit here in Melbourne. Only skate protection and I had a pace car follow me ( some family on holidays: had my own film crew-No I didnt know them). At those speeds theres alot of wind resistance. I believe if you have all your proper full face helmet and real protection gear and get into a low downhill racing crouch you could possibly go the 48km/hr.  Tighten the bushings. Oh I think the holiday makers were shocked to see me go that fast, their eyes were wide open, big smiles and alot of pics and video of me taken from the car as they kept up with me. Also your like me and have the advantage of being light. When onloop did those test runs for the top speed specs I dont think he would have had the streamline gear and hes also alot heavier. Having said all the above though he has set the speed limiter I think to make it max out at 45km/hr. But maybe some coasting after reaching 45km/hr down a slight incline. All only for the brave. The range of 30-40km/hr is more than enough for me.

Can't we set our own RPM limits? or do we need a bigger battery to support higher speeds
[/quote]

the easiest way to increase top speed is increase wheel diameter, maybe you can try a 90mmm

on a fully charged battery your max theoretical speed would be 35mph. 

just be careful and adjust riser height to minimise wheel bite.

it is not an answer to your question
but i would change the pulleys for more top speed instead of going with bigger wheels because you have mutch more control when driving with one riser less. if i were you i would really try it! i would not have believed it myself that the difference is so big if i had not ridden both configurations in direct comparison

it's not hard to change the pulley, you need to make a new pulley & maybe get a larger belt to ensure it will fit over the larger diameter.

_Have any of you guys actually riden a skateboard at 28mph+ before? why do you need to go faster?_

@onloop thanks for the info. I don't plan on doing this upon receiving the board as I will not know what my limit is. I just like knowing that if I do get tired of the speed eventually I can always make it go a bit faster :) 

@Jinra I don't at all :p but I do know it is completely possible to get bored with a board's speed when you've ridden it enough. I'd say the limit is @Photorph's board, I don't want to go over 30mph because I'd need leathers at that point and that isn't practical for my type of roads and riding.

@Dedbny it probably will be, I will see. I figure give it a month or two and I will know whether or not I want a speed bump. I'm thinking I will be fine considering I appreciate torque way more since I do a lot of stop and go and have massive hills.

[/quote]

This is the right question to ask.  I doubt many people here commenting have, unless there are people who do downhill longboarding or have taken their normal longboard on a long descent a few times.  Everyone just wants the fastest board, until they fall lol.

To all of you I'd say you don't need to go that fast.  I think when onloop set the limit to 27ish mph that's actually perfect.  The body evolved to travel no faster than about 25mph and at that speed (even if you have knee pads and a helmet) a fall will seriously mess you up to the point where you won't be E-skating for a while.  If you're going any faster and you hit something, your bones and organs simply can't handle the forces without CE approved armor.  And I believe you lose 1mm of flesh for each mph you are going above 25 mph without leathers.  If there is anyone here who has went down at 25+ mph without leathers on Tarmac, I'd like them to chime in.  I'm sure their opinion about raising speed might be different.

The fastest I've gone was ~52 mph downhill in Colorado on my landyachtz EVO (a DH specific board that is extremely stable at high speeds).  I had a triple 8 full face, gloves with pucks, and cheapo set of leathers with armor in knees and elbows.  I had to build up to that by gradually going on bigger hills.  

Fast forward to today when I prefer E-boards rather than traveling to Colorado to find hills...I've hit 38 mph on an electric board and I can say it feels just like hitting 52 mph on that EVO downhill.  In fact I can say I was more confident on the EVO going 52 mph vs going 38 mph on an Eboard that can't have a very low center of gravity due to the hardware under the deck and doesn't have bushings/wheels/trucks set up for DH speeds.  Esk8 are much more prone to speed wobbles than boards set up for DH, your footing and balance has to be perfect above 30 mph.

Going 27 mph on a raptor will give you the same sensation as hitting 40 mph on a DH board that you feel like you have more control over.  I can say that if you feel comfortable handling raptor max speed in a straight line and while turning, you can easily do 40 mph on a board set up specifically for DH because that's more manageable in my opinion.  

For those modding raptors and trying max speed runs that will exceed 27 mph I would say leathers are highly recommended if you value having skin.  I would also advise to tighten your trucks (specially the rear ones) a bit more than usual.  If you feel like you are about to get the wobbles, relax and do not stand up... Stay low and keep your head straight and focus on following a line.  

@Mr_Mahal looking forward to seeing your video of you maxing out the raptor.  And if you want a lot of views try a manual (basically a wheelie) at max speed... That will be a cool video lol.

increasing wheel diameter will increase your top end but it will also increase the startup torque required to get you moving and will affect your hill climbing ability as well to some degree. It's all about achieving the balance you are looking for because there are tradeoffs with every decision you make. 

Am i the only one around here who just likes to cruise at sane speeds around 20mph and below?

You want me to die eh? Lol

Thanks for the info, definitely good to know for my clothing choice...might go ahead and order that abrasion resistant jacket when the raptor comes around :p 

Everyone's comfort level and skill is different, I've never done downhill before so of course idk what it's like going through 0 go 50mph, but of the one time I did bail it was during night and because I didn't know my route as well as I thought, I kinda freaked myself out after going over a bump and basically ended up just jumping off. That said, I've come close many times before but my balance saved me. 

One thing I'd need to do before going max speed on any of these boards is learning how to foot break properly as I never really got good at it (barely needed to with the BBs speed, I could always run off).

The reason I want to go faster is because the BB has proven to me that 20mph isn't shit, and unless I'm going DH it's not even fast enough to warrant a speed tuck or crouch... Cyclists pass me, cars cut in front of me because I'm going too slow. I like to be on the road and when you can't even go the speed limit it can be difficult to enjoy it when you're the slowest one on the road and regarded like an average city bike commuter. I don't need to go 30mph, but it's more about having it available too me..

Yep, but a wooden (or CF) board with 4 tiny wheels without air... hard to compare that with a car or a bike.  Racing/keeping up with cars or bikes shouldn't be the goal, because a bike is wayyy more stable than any skateboard and of course a car I'm not even gonna mention.  You're in a lot more danger going 25 mph vs a biker going 25 mph.  Most bikers average speed is 12-18 mph though, so even 20 mph should be enough to pass them.  Hard care road bikers can hit 20 +.  Lance armstrong averaged 25 mph.  So with the raptor (or the GT) you can take out any cyclist in your area, but you're in a lot more danger than they are going full speed.

I don't want to race cars or bikes (although off the start I do enjoy taking off quicker), it's more about not impeding traffic when I'm on a one lane street. As you may know the "bike lane"  that most streets have that isn't clearly designated has a lot of debris in it which is dangerous to ride on with any board. So I tried to keep as close to the shoulder of the road as possible without riding over it. Still, cars will tend to honk at me occasionally or speed around me like I'm kick pushing in the street lol this is only on some roads but it really bothers me as I know what it's like to have to go below the speed limit in a car  to accommodate a cyclist that I can't pass. 

[quote="Photorph, post:188, topic:1299"]

[/quote]

Well I must live near some hardcore bikers or my BB was defective because it doesn't take much effort for cyclists around here to pass me (on flats at least).  It's not always the case but it's happened enough to get annoying. 

I understand the danger rapidly increases as I get to 25mph and further, I'm not going to be hitting that constantly since there is traffic that I have to adjust to and for that I will go slower. But there are enough times when the road is open and literally there are no cars or people in sight to where I can just max out  without fear of hitting something or someone. When I get my board I'll record my commute for you guys as you don't seem to really understand my environment

Ya, 25mph seem to be the sweet spot, less injuries too compare to 30+mph.

I've ridden the Marbel going at supposedly 25mph top speed before. It didn't really felt that much more faster than the BB, that's the reason why I want to increase the speed. But if raising the speed will reduce the torque I'd much rather keep it as is, I think having a high torque in a city commute will be a lot more fun than high speed.

At the end of the day I won't know what speed is too fast until I try it. All I wanted to accomplish by asking was knowing if there was a simple way to do it, and it seems like there isn't without some compromise so I'll likely just keep it as is or get a sports bike and leathers for more thrill :)

I have the same opinion like you even if I left the dare devil years behind me.
In this dare devil phase I have done some downhill stuff with speeds of over 80 kph and a fucking halve shelve on my head ðŸ˜†
So the Raptors 45 kph are very enjoyable for me and usually I go full throttle all the time.
On my daily fun ride I cant avoid a street with a lot of traffic. The max speed is set at 50 kph so I'm slightly to slow to swim in the traffic without annoying someone.
In my opinion the sweet spot in terms of max speed is 55 kph. The Raptor has so much torque that I'm sure it still climbs hills like a champ.
The reason why I haven't done anything yet, is that the main part of my favorite track is uphill. In numbers it is a 6.5 km street where I climb 400 m with crazy hill sections.
It is so much fun to eat hills like nothing. The Raptor has so much torque you can't imagine how fast you accelerate to top speed. This board is so much fun with the kick tail ðŸ˜˜ Is fits perfect for every situation.
Tight turns in the city and ridiculous fast speeds downhill. It really is a great board and I love it.
I'm interested how you like it when you get it.

Its fast 45km/hr, has great range on a single charge 30km, fast charging to full battery in about 1hr 30mins, you can swap out battery to extend range, reasonably light and manageable to lug around with its carry handle 7kg great look with carbon fibre deck and kick tails, and fully enclosed electronics, 

Best of all you can BOMB up hills.

Haaha I can totally relate dude!!! Frequently I feel like the value of this thing is "worth" FAR more than what I paid, and that's something I NEVER feel about any product I buy. This really is a first for me. Freaking LOVE the Raptor!! Going out for group ride today, shame you're not in UK..

Do you like the shape of the board? Is it hard to turn?

At first I didn't like the shape of the board - from when I ordered it to when it arrived. There's a reason there are so many shapes of boards, everyone has their own preference.

To me, the board is excessively long and wide, and the kick tail is longer than need be.

That said, now that I've actually been able to put some time on the board, I get why it was made so big. You really have to have a wide stance in order to handle the acceleration. The kick tail is a great place to brace your foot when accelerating, too. I'm 5'11" and a size 10.5 (43 euro) shoe. I'm able to fit my feet on the 'flat' part of the board when I have an angled stance. At high speeds, I find myself with a really angled stance and my back foot almost all the way back on the tail. At first, I wanted the tail to be wider where my foot was so I could get more turning input with my back foot. With more experience, I realize having the board be narrow at the back reduces steering input, which is a positive thing at speed because it reduces speed wobbles. 

At my height, the tail is still a bit too long and far back - a slightly shorter overall board and a shorter kick tail would suite me better. 

The edges of the board angle upward. This really helps you carve harder, I like it a lot. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about. My initial concern was it would hurt my feet. It does make the board less 'cruisy' - it's not a flat long board that you can kinda walk around on. I find that I get my stance set and then I maintain the same stance until I come to a stop. On my other long boards, I usually move around a lot while riding which this also prevents my feet from hurting. You don't wanna be moving around on this thing at speeds! At least I don't with my mininal experience on it so far. 

Board feels super smooth! I love how it turns. I'm guessing the wheels that were shipped with mine (late September, the clear blue ones) are softer than previous batches because they don't feel excessively hard. That said, I would still dig even softer wheels. I'm guessing the two sets of risers aid with its smoothness. I want to lower the board with different risers; I'm sure this will make it harder.

The shape of the Raptor reminds me of the skateboard Bart Simpson rode back in the day. 

**The more I ride the Raptor, the more everything about it makes sense.**

Thanks for the reply. I am trying to decide either on a boosted board or a raptor. Have you had any issues with the raptor?

I can't speak on reliability or customer service. I've only had my board a couple days. 

We all faced the same dilemma: Boosted or Raptor.

I went with the Raptor because it has better range, top speed, and acceleration than the Boosted Dual+ V2 and it's a couple hundred bucks cheaper using the code "PUSHINGSUCKS" or whatever it was for 10% off. I also figured if I didn't love the Raptor, I could sell it to someone else in the states for what I paid (I think that's a fair deal since the buyer wouldn't have to wait months). 

So far, I LOVE this thing! Once I paint the trucks black, I also think this board looks way cooler than the Boosted. It's very high-tech/serious looking in its stealth carbon fiber suit. 

ALSO, the Raptor is upgradable! When a better battery comes out, we'll get even more range, shorter charging time, better acceleration (can't even imagine that!), higher top speed, and less weight. It would cost more to build a board with the same specs as the Raptor without buying in bulk.

LASTLY, Jason seems very legit about his business. I've never heard of a company before where you can message the owner/CEO and get a response - think about that, that's insane! [that said, I don't like hearing about people emailing and messaging them all the time...leave 'em alone, let them work] It's like buying something from a friend; they aren't gonna screw you over. He's offering a money back guarantee and one of the best warranties in the industry. He knows that in order for his business to succeed, customer support is the most important factor. So, I believe they'll go out of their way to make sure every Raptor owner is satisfied and taken care of if there's ever an issue. 

They're only in their 3rd or 4th batch and they've already addressed every issue that anybody's ever had with the board. Really looking forward to getting the new remote - VERY cool that they shipped a second remote with the board to allow me to ride it right away!! Boosted is shipping standard batteries with their boards if you buy the extended range - that's also super cool. 

Kinda cool how the Boosted tracks your mileage...good if you're buying used, not so good if you're the seller.

Assuming this beast holds up (which I think it will), I would buy it again over the Boosted any day.

I thought you had gotten the raptor a while back?  The raptor is not comparable to boosted.  THey are two totally different boards.  I've had both as I'm sure you've seen in my reviews of the raptor.  If you value performance, no question raptor is the way to go.

@ArmandR I received my Raptor minus battery, vesc and remote. The board, trucks, wheels, motor mount, motors and mounting hardware ARE all top notch. They fit perfectly together. I had never heard of electric skate boards until a few months ago. I wanted something K.I.S.S. (keep it simple, stupid). Plug and play because my time is very limited. I don't plan to set any speed records just have fun, but I want to know the power is there just in case. My 1995 Mustang GT convertible didn't need the super charger... but I got one anyways!

I get tiny rocks stuck inside the larger gears every ride. I have to pop them out with a tiny screwdriver. It's only on the larger gears, probably because they are lower to the ground. If I didn't notice and continued riding, they'd wear through belts super fast. 

Why not put the motors on the back like Evolve? Would allow for a lower deck and probably help keep tiny rocks out of the gears. I guess that would render the kicktail useless, but I've yet to use my kicktail because I'm afraid to scratch the carbon fiber...I've adjusted my riding style/footing after about 4 rides and don't ever touch the kicktail. 



A simple plastic shroud would also fix this. 

Worth noting that I've been riding in Wyoming where the roads are notoriously rocky! It's impossible to avoid here but demonstrates a longterm flaw that could be addressed on future iterations.

I think hub motors probably are the future...but still there are benefits to the satellite system. The main drawback is not being able to swap out wheels as easily, since you are more or less stuck with the back wheels on the hubs (until more innovation). I just swapped out my stock raptor wheels for MBS all terrain, and the wheels feel amazing. This is not something you could do on the 2.0 (at least on the back)

Didnt end up  doing it as needed to get shorter screws,  but just havent found the time. I think even if the motors were in the back you would get stones flicking up if you ride in stoney area.  Hubs would be ideal for you.

Yup, just swapped out the stock bearings and nuts/washers and the wheel pulled fits it perfectly. I'm not sure if the gear ratio is perfect for the 100m wheels but it works pretty well. Definitely a noticeable drop in breaking ability though, but i may be able to tune the VESC for that

I agree. Hub motors will be the future, but belt driven system is tried and tested. There are definitely benefits to hub system aesthetically and visually, but the inability to change wheels is a tough drawback.

I owned a Boosted V1 D+, I now have a Evolve CGT and BGT. I never owned a Raptor but have ridden a couple. BB are the most user friendly and reliable, GTs are in my opinion the most and best for recreational or joyrides. Wasn't a big fan of the Raptor 1 TBH. The Raptor 2 on the other hand may trump them all?! To buy one only would be a hard decision, it depends on where you're riding it and what your priorities are. 
Hope that helps,
Mick

Thank you very much!!

TBH I have a Boosted Board V2 Dual plus held on deposit, but the extended wait is disappointing. I've got my eye on the new evolve GT bamboo series and it's difficult to sift thru the BS. The raptor 1&2 just don't catch my eye the same and again the specifications can get muddy. Decisions decisions **strong text**

I'm a little late jumping on the Enertion band wagon but this week I'm happy to say I received a new (0 miles spotless) Raptor from a really good guy off this forum.

I've skated since I was a kid, but I'm totally new to the electric rides. It didn't take long before I was totally hooked! I'm blessed to have owned and ridden quite a few really nice complete electric skateboards... Boosted V2, Evolve Gen2 carbon and bamboo, Carbon GT Street/AT. I love ALL of those boards, honestly. The Boosted board and Gen2 Evolve boards are a great place to start if you're just getting into this fun stuff. 

I have yet to delve into DIY builds, but after lurking this forum for a month or so, I caught the bug. So much talent and creativity on his forum, I'm blown away!! :sunglasses:

So, that brings me to my initial, first week reactions to the Raptor 1.  Of course, if you're on this forum you know the Raptor was designed with high performance torque in mind... to say that Jason achieved this, would be the understatement of the year :joy: The Raptor has torque that will send your ass flying off the board if you're not fully engaged. For a point of comparison, Evolve GT is an amazing product with quite a bit of power. Before I tried the Raptor, my Carbon GT was the highest performance eskateboard I've ever ridden. After spending a week with the Raptor I have nothing but good things to say about it. The acceleration curve is so smooth!! It's unmatched compared to anything I've tried so far. The breaks are the same... smooth but extremely powerful and efficient. I've swapped out the Enertion wheels for 83mm, 75a flywheels and I feel that was a nice improvement to the overall ride. As far as the trucks go, I swapped the bushings for something I was familiar with and achieved a nice balance of carve and stability when you're ripping 25+ mph. 

The Raptor is legit. In so many ways, it's the best electric longboard I've ridden so far. It's easily one of the best complete boards available to date... but it's undeniable that the thing is dangerous and demands full respect :grimacing: I can see that many of the builds on this forum are equally as "scary" as the Raptor... in a good way of course haha. 

Last thing about it is, I wouldn't recommend anyone ride this thing at top speeds without a full face helmet and some serious wrist guards/gloves. I've always struggled with wrist guards and eskate controllers but they are a must if you care about your hands and wrists. 

Hope this honest/unbiased review helps some people decide to buy the last of the Raptor Ones out there... the board really is amazing, and with the big brother six months around the corner, a lot of people are selling their boards. I snatched one up and couldn't be happier with it. 

Have fun riding!! 
Cheers,
Dave

Edit: Damn, I wrote a lot!!! Didn't even realize it haha.  Apologies for the wordy reply to the thread :grin:

Hey Dedbny, thanks for recognizing my write up on the Raptor.  It is an amazing board and I'm happy I decided to get it even with the R2 preorder on the way. Hopefully since I purchased one from the last batch of Raptors a lot of those issues you mentioned have been worked out (crossing fingers) :wink:
