The Enertion Dual Motor Raptor's first third party review complete is up! The crew at Review Longboards after [a past collaboration](http://reviewlongboards.com/diy-electric-longboards-the-start-of-a-movement/), decided to try out the Enertion Raptor and write up a complete review of the board. You can see from the review that they loved the board! Check out the [Enertion Raptor Review](http://reviewlongboards.com/enertion-raptor-review/) and their great website, [Review Longboards](http://reviewlongboards.com/), here.

Congrats on the solid review.  

While it's good that they reviewed this board, honestly I felt they did a pretty bad job of reviewing it.  They basically reiterated specs and things everyone already knows.  There were no objective tests done.  Plus I feel a video review draws in many more buyers.  I'm not sure why no 3rd party or customer has done a proper video review yet, but I'll definitely be doing one as soon as I get mine.  I have been informing people on the boosted subreddit about your board though, and most people didn't even know it existed.  If the raptor lives up to its claims, I have no doubt that once word gets out buyers will flock to this over boosted.  And with my video review, I hope to spread knowledge about the performance differences between the raptor and my boosted.

I also can't wait to do some videos on mine, maybe with some nice drone shots.
Just need mine to make the far way to Germany :frowning2:
