@Calhoun I hope this solve your numbering and math problems. However this horse power this doesn't tell me anything. Its kinda obvious which one is more powerfull.

Good stuff!

Would be awsome if the vesc could compute these numbers.

It would justify my setup, one motor driving and to other would be the "sensor"

Yeah, i think it would be good if the VESC could extract some more data & compute it into something more meaningful to a layman..  we need Vedder to make some updates to the BLDC tool, maybe BLDC Dyno Edition.. Then a system like you pictured would be perfect. Easy to build & operate.

You can also buy small dynos too,

Coowl test! And amazing that you can put 1.5hp to the ground with a wheel that small ^^.

There is a linear relation between power (in watts ) in and horsepower out ( 750W per horsepower ). The only error that is introduced is the losses in the transmission and bearings and that is something that is hard to measure in the VESC. What would you like to see other than the power consumption times a scalar?

Well, i think the load is not realistic! The guy is just leaning on it. I would prefer someone staying on the board or just put some heavy weight on it (80kg).

I guess they are also looking for a data stream to interface with the dyno. Something to output the rpm of the motor maybe.

## \#9 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-05-04T14:21:28.827Z Reads: 179

```
stuff like:

peak torque output & X rpm
torque output comparisons 
horsepower comparo
torque output / current draw / voltage comparo


Basically i want to be able to have 10~ different motors(with varying stator & winding configs) & drive train configurations and test them to compare what is most efficient & best torque....

With something that can fit on my desk.

Did I hear this right? @jacobbloy You have motor controller? Let see it or was Jason just stroking you. You guys aren't thinking of stealing credit from Vedder are you?   I think it is great that you are creating apps for the VESC but lets give the credit to Vedder for the motor controller.

settle down..............

edit: our focus now is making the best possible drive trains on the market... the vesc as it is doing a great job.

ALSO, i will have 2000 vesc in a matter of weeks....

I guess i didnt catch the part about the motor controller in the video

 @onloop  Hopefully it wont be obsolete by that time.  

@Karmannghiagirl in the video he said it was @jacobbloy  motor controller, was just trying to get more info but it turns out they were talking about the VESC.

## \#17 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-05-04T14:34:40.078Z Reads: 157

```
based on the info from @JTAG

1HP = 750WATTS

With fully charge space pack & vesc config I have max 2100watts. (42v MAX 50A) Of course with voltage sag this drops rapidly under load, so lets say i have around 40v at 50A, so just 2000watts

& At the wheel i had just 1500watts (2HP)

So it seems to be about 25% losses in the drive train.

this is the only reason i would like a dyno....

so i can reduce the losses in transmission....

This is one reason why Hub motors might be the key!

Yea he was talking as if he was talking to Vedder not me! But we all know Vedder is busy but still working on some great stuff! Like recently using a as5047 sensor to have a very easy and high resolution sesnsored control!

But any way this video was mainly about doing some thing different and having some fun!
The guy could t measure torque for us which is what we went in for as his torque cell was damaged in he last race bike Dyno run and he didn't have a optical or hall rpm add on and this stuff is a couple of grand adding with dynojet dyno's.
Sadly no torque!
But I'm currently working on a way to do this at home because it will help lots with development of the hubs can get like 10 different motors made and test them efficiently

Yeah my mistake, I had this playing in the background while I was making battery packs.

> I think the paranoia is setting in at ollin HQ... :stuck_out_tongue:

You still don't get it do you? You make board for the masses, I make boards for downhill riders. Now if I put my sights on short range boards with limited output then you can start worrying ;)

You might want to rethink doing that to my momma ;) Mexican women are fierce!
