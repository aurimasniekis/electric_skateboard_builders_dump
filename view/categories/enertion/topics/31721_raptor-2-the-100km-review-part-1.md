How on earth could those thin urethane "skins" possibly be comfortable or durable?

For me this the biggest issue with hubs. Not enough wheel material outside the motor to make it viable.

Carvons tho...I'd like to try those one day...

I was expecting a rock hard ride, but was pleasantly surprised.  I agree that a full wheel would be a little better again in terms of ride comfort though. I don't think durability is going to be a problem, there's still a fair bit of urethane there and it's good quality.

100% agree with the incorrect position of the handles. Jason tried to tell us that you can shift to the back of the handle, but all the videos I've seen proved that it never balances! I have no idea why he made this mistakes because Raptor 1's handle position make it perfectly balanced

Even if you hold the handles right at their rearmost point it is still unbalanced. Jason originally designed the R2 with the handles positioned further towards the rear but said it just looked wrong.

Weight did change over the course of development of the R2. With the rear being heavier on the production model compared to the prototype perhaps weight balance is different? I don't know.

If you follow the R2 project from its very inception last year (as I did) he estimates total weight along the way. It started at below 10kg, went to about 10kg, and ended up at 11.8kg.

I doubt that the overall weight had any effect on the balance. I was hoping you could provide some info on how the weight of the motors changed (that would have explained the handle position). Right now it still seems like bad engineering to me. Something he was made aware of and still did not changed :confused:

Not sure if this helps out at all, but I rode/held the R2 when they came to Portland a couple weeks ago and the handle felt nice. Seems to hold the center of balance when I held it towards the back of the handle (closest to the motors). Those handles have been something that I've been thinking about trying to recreate on my DIY build. 

My little bully Cleo checking out the R2 before we went for a group ride with it. It's a REALLY nice board. I really didn't believe that those hubs/urethane would be as comfortable to ride as they were. Glad I purchased it.

_Bad engineering? Thanks for the insult pal._ 

Apart from making it easy to pick up the board, the handles are a structural part of the deck. Designed to prevent flexibility at wheelbase centre, this reinforcement strengthens the core and prevents the battery from being damaged from everyday stressors that occur when Riding up to 54km/h

Moving the handle 2 - 3 inches to the rear, simply to balance the board when you carry it makes it look wierd/imbalanced. But worse than that it allows the deck to flex more, slightly off centre, directly in the middle of the battery pack, which is VERY BAD engineering. 

Any designer or engineer will tell you that most projects have "function-over-form" constraints that control what is possible, sometimes sacrifices must be made. In this case board balance, when walking around with it in hand, took 2nd priority over structural, performance, longevity and reliability factors.

If you look back at the posts in the raptor thread I said the same thing last year already. Not an insult in my mind. It is apparently not correctly balanced and that makes it unfit for the job (I don't have a raptor so I base this completely on the review that was linked). Rest seems like a great board.
There are a number of ways you could have taken care of structural integrity of the deck so that is no excuse.

Jason please,  that's childish. A handle that is not balanced is badly engineered. That's the point of a handle, to carry a board without too much stress. 
Attacking people cause they point out a flaw of the board doesn't seem very mature, especially taking as example their first diy board. My cousin used to do the same, when somebody criticized him, instead of understanding he criticized back. But he was 3 y/o. If your deck has problems sustaining one's weight, you shouldn't rely on the handles to fix this issue. Good engineering means you get working handles and no stress on the battery. Bad engineering means you have handles but can barely use them cause they're in a useless spot, and at that point you can just call them "reinforcement metal bars". Not only you can't see your (overall good) board's flaws, but you attack people who try to help you. As we say in Italy, "you stepped on a shit this time". Be more professional please, you aren't a diyer anymore, Jason.
P.s. Jason deleted one comment. The "childish" refers to the fact that he took a pic of Maxid's first build to make fun of his "engineering skills"

Very well written review Micky, thanks!
Looking forward to part deux.

Imo, the handles on the Raptor 2 seem to be a solution to a problem that never existed.

Would have looked heaps better with none at all.



If it (Raptor 2) had been spec'd with an integrated cutout deck for the electronics that couldn't be swapped easily to another deck, the handles, not the lack of them, would definitely be a deal breaker for me.

If people are trying to help why not list specific instructions on how to solve the problem? Instead of insults!

Saying "Bad engineering" is not helpful? It's trolling. My trolling policy is to fire back and be equally insulting.

Furthermore, Saying there are plenty of ways to resolve the problem, without listing them is idiotic, it is not helpful.

A true professional would provide a detailed response on how a problem can be solved. They might also choose to structure their critical thoughts in the form of a question.

Example: 

"Hi Jason, love the raptor 2, wish the handle was balanced, wondering why you didn't:

1. Make the handle longer.
2. Reposition the handle (not an option)
3. Make lighter motors (not an option)
4. Remove the kick tail (not an option)
5. Make the nose heavier.
6. Use heavier battery.

this is called constructive criticism / feedback that deserves a proper response.

[/quote]

Thanks for the uneducated nonsense feedback, You have never held the board have you, what exactly prevents the handles from being used.... 

I like where the handles are, they are 1000% better than every board without handles, they are there for many reasons which I have clearly explained.

@sirdiff I'll give respect when it's deserved but you and your freind simply don't deserve it. You and your trolling freind can go and find some one else to "help"

_P.s. if you ever need professional enginnering help on a project let me know I'll gladly help and I won't insult you during the process either._

This is where you're mistaken. You're not a single scrub on a diy forum, you're Enertion's face. And I can ensure you that Evolve's face and Boosted's face would NOT act like this. Just say "we don't agree" and stop it there. Nobody cares about small discussions like this, but if you want to play with the big guys you have to act like them, and not waste your time looking at diyers' old builds just to troll. At least not with your main public account.

You're on a DIY forum, he's not a true professional, and i'm not one either. We're just pointing out what people believe to be flaws (I did not try it, I read a couple of reviews. I didn't come here insulting in the first place). His option was "reposition the handle", which was in your list too. Making the battery or the board heavier would be nonsense, that's already heavy enough. 
I appreciate the handles, i think it's a great addition. But they're not perfect, and they should be. It's not rocket engineering, it's handles, and normal boards should work even without their support. Make them longer, if you think it's possible. I don't have measurements, qualifications nor time to help you, but i'm sure your team can do just a bit better, that's all.

And no, he's not my friend. We haven't even ever talked to each other. I just see a great potential in the raptor 2 and think it should be as good as it can get. And i wish Enertion the best to compete in this market that is getting flooded with chinese garbage or overpriced hipster stuff.
I'm not very good at engineering, but if you need help for public relations, just let me know. I'll gladly help you ;)

I'm myself an engineer and this kind of conversation is so boring, I'm sure Jason and the team look a millions ways to put the handles before to put as it is right know, I'm sure they had a lot of better solutions, but they need to choose the one  don't add much weight to the board, don't add much cost to the customers, dont add much complexity to the supplier, because they needed to bring this project to life and not make an utopic board that never see the light. 

If the handles adds stiff and longevity to the board and they are cheap to produce, who cares if the balance is a little to the ass? 

There are not perfect proyects but you always do as perfect as you can, no one can says Jason had no passion at work, you only attack him because, he is a winner and he is proud of it, he is often right and he is proud of it, he has more money than you, your are fanboys of belt drive system, you are fanboys of carvon or other brands, you are children's, you are trolls, yo want your board before your birthday, he speeds up one video, you don't like his answers, etc, etc, etc.

grow up and stop trolling!

Jason thanks about being a CEO talking to the people and not hiding, please dont change because of loosers and trolls, I'm saying this because this must be the reason behind CEOs never talk to customers.

I don't highly value those opinions from people who have minimal experience in a particular field, who focus their negative energy and publicly insult & belittle people about what they have perceived to be engineering flaws. Especially when they have no understanding or first-hand experience with the product design or development & when they offer no new ideas to help improve the problem.

If you want to have an engineering debate, be intelligent, bring some evidence and clearly define your arguments. 

**There is no need for the insults.**

Wow. You do miss a engineer to make those handles functional but most of all you should look for a public relations manager.

Im still holding off on making an order on the raptor since the season is over here anyways and I want to see how the board survives the first customers testing it. It looks good by now but the "I'm all knowing superior to you" attitude of the management is frightening. Wonder what happens if a receive a board with problems or get problems with it and enertion just claims it's my error since they never make any mistakes.

i got to ride the R2 and can offer some feedback. I use my board every day to do almost everything. Going to the laundromat, getting some groceries, getting to/from work, going to friends houses, going out for coffee or a beer...doing this with the R2 would blow. Its like a pickup truck. Tons of fun, super cool, but a painus in the anus as a practical means of transportation. it was heavy and cumbersome, off balance, and the owner was experiencing issues inside both hubs as well as will the urethane breaking apart. Its not that you wont see this issues on a diy board with similar parts, you just wont be paying a premium for the issues.

I watched R2 Videos and really can feel efforts into making and designing. I want to buy one even if handle is not there at all. I don't give a ef about handle seriously.

but I don't understand the Jason's take on "Bad Design" as an insult. Cuz it is not. It is true that the board is not balanced when you hold by the handle. it's a valid point.
Rather than calling those people "Slave", why don't  you man up?
you could've stoped at "it's part of structural support"
It really sounds like in denial afterwords.

[quote="Minim, post:32, topic:31721"]

[/quote]

Thanks for the feedback, I'm sorry though I do disagree with you.

So we are clear, the issue being debated is actually the handle position, not the handle design itself. The handles are comfortable and large enough that your fingers can pass through the open area & grasp the handle bar with ease. It's unlikely any engineer could improve the function of a simple "handle" 

**So what can the engineer do?**
1. reduce the motor weight - less performance
2. increase the battery weight - already heavy
3. put motors closer to center - requires smaller battery
4. put battery further from center - increases wheel base and makes deck more flexy
5. remove the kick tail - easy solution but not going to happen
6. make the front wheels heavier - no advantage & increases overall weight
7. Make the handle much longer - adds to the cost & weight, looks a bit strange
8. Move the handles further to the back? - solves balance problem, but creates a weak point.

**So what option to choose?**  #7 is the simplest of these ideas but is also creating a weakness. So I don't think an engineer can magically solve these design constraint problems.

However I am still open to suggestions, In fact, I'll pay $1000 cash to the person who can come up with an acceptable solution that doesn't compromise the integrity of the battery and electronics components. Remember! Saftey first.

Overall, the handles function very well for their intended purpose, believe it or not, it's the 3rd revision of the original design.

Sorry didn't mean to scare you! :wink:

Please take a moment & think about this, you will struggle to find another CEO openly discussing & sharing the design & product development process with the people who helped fund it. 

Whether you believe it or not, I actually took in lots of feedback from various forum members about how to make the Raptor 2 better. One of the earliest criticisms about the handle was how they were attached protruding above the deck, I took the feedback on board and changed the design to recess the handle below the top of the deck so it wouldn't interfere with foot position.

So please try to understand that I am not here saying I know better than everyone, I am simply saying that people shouldn't comment in such negative ways unless they understand the entire story or are willing to participate in some type of civil discussion to debate the problem.

Regarding your concerns about what happens if you have a problem, you can rest assured, Raptor 2 comes standard with 12 months parts replacement warranty that covers all manufacturing faults. You can also extend that to 2 years. We also have 24/7 chat support on our website.

I don't need to list ways to solve the problem - that is your job. I made you aware of an issue with your product last year already and back then all you said was that it works great. Now we see it does not.
A handle's whole purpose is to offer a comfortable way to carry something - a handle that is not balanced is unfit for the job and that makes it bad engineering - this is not an insult but an objective observation so don't take this personal and maybe forward it to the engineer responsible for the decision so that raptor 3 does not have that issue anymore.
I also told you to check out whiteponys builds (which I know you already know of) to solve the structural integrity part. Thicker wood, a carbon or a glass fibre layer could have solved any issues your deck had in terms of carrying weight.

The one trolling were you when you brought up my first build - and I am not even sure why you did that and what it was supposed to say about me. Actually I feel kind of proud that the guy who started this forum found the time to check out my profile in such detail that he looked through my topics and checked my build out. It's a cool build for the money I spent on it right?

The whole point was to show that if you hold your board at the end of the handles it will be mostly balanced. Nothing else. And if you think that means his pinky is doing most of the work you haven’t carried much things in your life.

So what about those rear wheels... Knew they would be an issue. It's really the biggest issue that no hub motor manufacturer has fixed... yet. That design of diamonds hold my wheel in place scares me. Not the original exploded diagrams design, and it will be prone to these kinds of warps. Low duro wheels will have this issue. The solution is simple, or at least for us (hummie and I), but I''m not giving away any more info than that. P.S. think about what happens when the wheels heat up and expand. Geometrically, theres a shape that works the best.

So, how does it feel to hold the handle with the board backwards, so the motors are in front of you? Seems like that would be a lot more comfortable to hold and have a better ergonomic angle for the hand and wrist. 

It still cracks me up that the handle location seems to be the biggest problem and the main topic of discussion. Not performance, value, ride quality, etc.

Why wouldn't adding, say, aluminum L-bars/extrusions next to the battery work? i can't CAD but something like this.

alternatively, why not move the handles out a little bit so they're in line with the wheels? this wouldn't effectively widen the board since the wheels already go that far out but it would make the CF more consistently wide. It would look something like the left half of this image

thanks for the input, 

however, i think it's important to emphasize that the current design, with handles centered between wheels (pictured below right side), is structurally sound.

The problem is if you move the handles backward (pictured above left side) you are then creating a weak spot. then you would need to strengthen the center. This is why i was arguing not to move the handles...

heres my 2 cent, take it as you will. If I can fly off a curb and land 150lbs on my .4 inch thick board, the R2 is strong enough to tolerate having a "weak spot" and having the handles moved back to offset the imbalance. I feel like the weakest spot will still be more than strong enough to handle a 200+ lb rider

A handle that rotates  (in the same plane as the board of course) a forever-captive pin at the rear allows it to rotate 180 degrees and either snap into front "home position" (where it is now) or rotate it and snap in to the rear "carry position" 

I fuckin hate handles but that might be the simplest way to give the people a well balanced handle 

Just pick the board up by the front trucks people!  You alrrady have a handle!!!  It works fine and always balances !!!

If the handle position is the biggest gripe that future owners have with the board then you can consider the R2 to be a massive success.

No dude, people were piling on and calling the board poorly engineered because of a handle position.  He got offended and explained the reasoning behind the handle location then everyone got butthurt for bluntly being called wrong.  Everyone threw around personal insults and acted like being called wrong justified it.  Someone called him a 3yo for defending his decision...

Here let's reread his original response.

> Bad engineering? Thanks for the insult pal.

> Apart from making it easy to pick up the board, the handles are a structural part of the deck. Designed to prevent flexibility at wheelbase centre, this reinforcement strengthens the core and prevents the battery from being damaged from everyday stressors that occur when Riding up to 54km/h

> Moving the handle 2 - 3 inches to the rear, simply to balance the board when you carry it makes it look wierd/imbalanced. But worse than that it allows the deck to flex more, slightly off centre, directly in the middle of the battery pack, which is VERY BAD engineering.

> Any designer or engineer will tell you that most projects have "function-over-form" constraints that control what is possible, sometimes sacrifices must be made. In this case board balance, when walking around with it in hand, took 2nd priority over structural, performance, longevity and reliability factors.

grow up everyone.

holy crap! this thread has gotten out of hand. The review is that the Raptor 2 is effing awesome in terms of performance and comfort. I do agree that the handle's position make it unbalanced while holding it for a longer period, but this current back and forth needs to stop. No one needs to call Jason a bad designer or engineer. Moving the current handle back would look a bit weird and probably affect the ride as your toes of heels might get stuck in them. I'm not sure of that weak spot Jason mentioned. The Raptor 1's handle is underneath the deck, maybe Raptor 3 could revisit that option for that perfect balance once again.

@onloop I apologize for being one of the people who opened this can of worms. I have never walked with a e-board for more than a few minutes so a slightly tilted Raptor for that period of time would not hurt...if it did, maybe I should use an analog board instead 'cause clearly I need the exercise.

Just to be clear... I've rode a Raptor 2 for the last two month (over 1500km), and never got any rock, water, sand or dirth between the wheel and the thane, also I've never had slippage. What you see in the picture is dust from the thane, not from another exterior source.

1st, I didn't call him 3 yo, I said his answer were not mature and he was acting like one. Instead of accepting critics he was trolling a member for pointing out his board's flaws. 
2nd, tell me honestly if this is a mature answer from a company CEO defending from one guy who said "the handle is not balanced, so it's badly engineered".

Nobody said Jason is a bad engineer (he agreed he isn't a professional and has a team), but that the handle is just not right. If you rely on the handle for the structural integrity and you sacrifice the handle's usability it's not good engineering. You should all understand what are insults (example: your engineering skills suck) and what are critic comments (your handle does not work well, you should fix its balance) instead of being butthurts for no reason for a comment on a handle nobody really cares about when buying this board (that destroys the competition anyway) 
You can move on, I think Jason learned to be less mean to people, even if they don't agree with him. He isn't changing the handle anyway. 
Oh and Jason, thanks for calling me a "slave", I appreciate that ;)

I think mostly out of assumptions since It's not build as everything else on the market. I also agree that the formula as to be replace the pre-pruduction formula is still holding good, It might have alot of crack from running over rock and ruff pavement, don't forget that I'm testing the shit out of it, but still the thane is in one piece and does it job well

Cracks/and such are to be except IMO, so that's good news. Even in the best full thane wheels(abec 97s, or more recently the 107s) get cracks pretty quickly during normal use, so that's no worry. It was mainly the intrusion of rocks/dirt that worried me(seems that's not the case?). You don't notice and slippage feeling under heavy load during turning(and or braking while turning)?

 Thanks for the quick response johnny(glad someone is testing it hard). Hopefully we can get a visual on the updated thane wheels soon.

There was a case of precision skoas axles snapping at an event not too long ago.

Even the best precision longboard trucks have had a rare case of axles snapping. Thats with super light 75mm wheels in comparison.

For a truck with huge hub motors you definitely need something with at least 10mm+

Really?

Does that mean I get 1000$ ;)

However I am still open to suggestions, In fact, I’ll pay $1000 cash to the person who can come up with an acceptable solution that doesn’t compromise the integrity of the battery and electronics components. Remember! Saftey first.

Do you know if you have the 8mm axle or the new 10mm axle that boards are shipping with now?

I think it was the 10mm one because I’ve only had the board for about a month and a half.

that's some fucked up shit.    surprised no one is dead yet.  and about a million of us saw it coming.  even the original prototype was said to fail and they said they fixed it then with the stainless axle or something.  trust:-1:

What settings would we need to put your hubs under the Raptor 2?

Also, do you have them available? :smiley:

you could use any settings but nothing available for a while, i mean other than those sold which will be shipping out this month.  have to do a kickstarter to raise money to go further.

 Somersaulted out of a fishtail when it happened... only a few minor scrapes... think I was only going 20mph. Not sure on the total distance I’ve ridden the raptor 2 but I know it’s not too far considering I got some defective outwheels
