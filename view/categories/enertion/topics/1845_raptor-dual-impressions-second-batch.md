```
got my battery last thursday.  i had received the raptor a while back but could only stare longingly at it.  there was non-stop rain here in the bay area.  the storms finally let up and i was able to take the raptor out for a spin.  i'm no stranger to speed.  i'm a full-on thrill seeker and i drive high-powered vehicles that require delicate but deliberate touches and leave little room for error.  i drag knees while tracking my heavily modified 2009 Yamaha R1 on racing slicks.  over 200hp, and less than 500 lbs makes it a cruise missile on two wheels.  very touchy throttle with no traction control.  i also have a '68 pro-touring camaro with over 650hp... no traction control either and an even touchier throttle.  i can go on and on about drifting cars i've had and so on but you get it.  the funny thing is that those toys i just mentioned are much more tame and much better daily-driver material than this board was out of the box, and they don't give as big a thrill as this bad boy.

my first impressions with the raptor were mixed.  i love carbon fiber, so i was drooling all over it.  even the outside of the rear wheels have a carbon fiber hub.  very slick.  the design of the deck is great.  the deck has four extra holes drilled into the front and back to accommodate other size trucks (newer models will not).  i also don't know if i trust the drive belts to last very long either.  i bought extra and will have to keep them handy.  otherwise, i love the look and the high-grade quality components.

there were early-assembly kinks to work out too, but it just required me checking and tightening all bolts, which I should do anyway.

then i rode it.  yes, high quality components.  the wheels are just right.  the deck has a kicktail, allowing you to take on corners.  it has more power than i expected.  whooo!  i'm 190 lbs and had lots of wobble at speed even with the trucks tightened quite a bit.  i'll try to tighten them even more but may have to replace bushings.  the remote feels great in my hand... but... the remote settings it was shipped with really really really suck.  i've been hearing about "millimeter increments" but the truth is that even at the lowest signal it is running quite hard, continuing to accelerate even when it's already at uncomfortably fast speeds.  i was hoping it would top out at a reasonable clip but i didn't have a safe stretch where i could have safely "topped out" (i'm referring here to the lowest sustained speed where the throttle is not off, not referring to wide open throttle/top-speed).  so the only way to ride it is to give it some juice and then let it coast and then accelerate and then coast... rinse, lather, repeat.  very ghetto.  minimum sustained speed under power is already silly, and applying even a few millimeters of more throttle will be X-games territory.  i'm sure this will easily be addressed after tweaking the settings.  it's pretty cool that we can fine tune all the settings. 

the good news is that the remote settings are supposedly addressed with a bit of reprogramming.  i think the remotes ended up with different characteristics than what the controllers were programmed to handle.  but we need to buy some obscure usb down adapter part to connect a cable to the VESC and we need to download some linux program and a bunch of other hassles.  then i have to go hunt around through some forum posts to find instructions and then deal with trial and error while i fine-tune it.  ugh.  not a showstopper i guess.  it will allow me to fine-tune it to my liking.  i'd be less annoyed if it already came with a cable and adapter and some step by step instructions so i didn't feel like there were so many barriers to overcome.  right now there's a lot of inertia to overcome and it'll take me a while to get to it... expected hassles of being an early adopter.

then there is the lack of a reliable signal from the remote due interference from the old-style lids.  new lids are being sent out that allow for greater signal range.  they're not sexy carbon fiber but i prefer function over form any day of the week.  i wonder how long it will take to get these new lids though.  in the meantime, the raptor is useless unless i remove the lid altogether or drill lots and lots more holes.

i'm still pleased with the purchase so far.  all of the issues are surmountable and look to be teething pains with the first batch.  if remote sensitivity and signal reliability are addressed, then it would be an unbelievable product.  as far as assembly/quality control, i don't have the time or electrical skills to assemble it myself so i'll just accept what i get.  to be honest, the thought of soldering wires and shrink-wrapping components makes me cringe and who knows what hurdles i'd run into and how much time i'd sink into building it myself.  i know i would have royally screwed that part up and burned several precious weekends.  i'm a little conflicted... on one hand i expected a pre-assembled, turnkey unit.  on the other hand, i have to accept the reality of issues that come with early adoption of a bleeding edge product.  in the end, a little frustration with an early unit will be well worth it, as there is nothing else quite like it.

am i glad i bought it?  yes.  once i work out the issues with the remote, it will be the coolest commute vehicle ever.  right now it's a thrill-seeking toy, but still cool.  i'd rather have this raptor over a boosted board any day, even with the uncalibrated remote.  this is much more like a custom hot rod than a production vehicle.  as long as i keep thinking of it that way, i'll have the right perspective as this is the product of a labor of love.  i also appreciate the support from enertion by recognizing the issues and coming up with solutions.  i gotta admire the loads of time and energy has been spent in R&D to get to this point.  this initial batch may have been a bit rushed out the door, but i guess i'm now part of the process (and glad to be part of it).

Thanks for your honest review & detail summary of thoughts regarding the raptor!.

I feel you topic deserves are thorough response.

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]

[/quote]

this was just stupid mistake, trying to make a product compatible with different trucks had no advantage & made it look shit.... none of the decks come like that anymore... 

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]
don't know if i trust the drive belts to last very long either.
[/quote]

this won't be an issue, they last a very long time unless something specifically destroys them.. like rocks, debris etc or really abusing them by smashing the throttle on full & braking really hard instantly over & over.. 9mm htd5mm belts are now basically an esk8 industry standard and there are hundreds of people who can reassure you that they will work well for a very long time. TIP: make sure you don't have them too tight. they should be tensioned softly.

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]
but was disappointed to see that two of the six nuts were just spinning freely and another two needed tightening.
[/quote]

about 30% of these boards were assembled by people who where new employees... sometimes you expect other people to know what you know about building eboards... exactly how much torque should that bolt have is something that an individual only realizes after building & riding many eboards... This was my biggest fuck up. Basically, I got to the point where I could no longer run my business, pack orders, answer emails & build raptors as a one man band... I needed help fast and with that came mistakes... lesson learned! I should have planned better & trained-up some help way before I was deep in the shit.

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]
then i opened the deck to connect the battery.  if the components had been rearranged slightly, or the wire to the battery connector was a bit shorter, then it would have fit nicely.  after connecting the battery i had to wrestle the connector and wire and bend it around and smush it into place in order to get the deck lid to fit back on.
[/quote]

YEAH i agree inside looks like shit, the solution is not as easy as you might think... I could make a small mounting rig and then route the cables & make it beautiful, but unfortunately it was too late to do that and i was drastically behind schedule. My intended solution (below) had some major setbacks and was never going to be ready in time to make it into these raptors so it was a matter of doing it the best we could. The Inside of the raptor will eventually be a master piece.

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]
i'll try to tighten them even more but may have to replace bushings.
[/quote]

yes, replacing the bushings is a very good idea, those ones are only good if you weight like 60-70kg... Eventually ill have a solution for this, i am working with a professional skte bushing company who make cutom bushing for downhill racing. So ill have them tuned for the speeds and riding that i think most raptor owner will be doing.

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]
about the whole "millimeter" thing, it's not that every millimeter of joystick travel will give a slightly bit more juice.  it's not the least but precise but rather stepped, with only 3 noticeable steps.
[/quote]

this will go away after some fine tuning, once again this could have been resolved with a better QC process! lesson well learned! 
Here is a really boring video demonstrating it 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEWHhwSDkug

[/quote]

YES, you need a USB cable that fits!, ill be supplying them from now on. ALSO, I offer a free 2 hour vesc session with @jacobbloy so you can learn how to program your vesc to suit your requirements! 


[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]
then there is the lack of a reliable signal from the remote.  the remote loses signal if it's more than three feet from the deck, such as swinging my arm up in the middle of a turn to keep my balance.  the signal even gets blocked by my leg if my arm swings forward a bit.  the last signal received will stay locked on, resulting in some unexpected and unwanted behavior if you lose signal at the wrong time.
[/quote]

All these issues go away with new lid, will arrive at your house in 10-14 days.

[quote="randogg, post:1, topic:1845"]

[/quote]

I really appreciate this approach, Yes, the product has had some teething issues... I could have held it back... But this entire process has actually been extremely beneficial for rapid raptor development (as much as it probably has been disappointing for the early adopters)... because if I didn't release it, If I never made these mistakes and never got such awesome feedback from my customers there is a chance I may not have fix some of the problems... Learning from mistakes is great! you need to make them first though... **I really want to thank all my customers for helping me make a better product.**

**Final notes to readers of this thread**, once the teething issues are all gone and the product is close to perfect the price unfortunately will go up, this product has market leading performance and needs to be priced accordingly, also i am a business that needs to make a certain margin to survive which i am not doing at the previous Raptor sales prices, so eventually there will be no more hot raptor sales. So if you are keen on a raptor and are an early adopter keep your eyes out for upcoming sales, there are probably only two or three more sales coming.

Like the post. Your thoughts and feelings echo some of my own with the raptor dual. Part of the issue with the dual is the stupid torque it has...for a beginner eboarder (like me) it's the equivalent of learning to ride a motorcycle on your R1. I also agree on some of the fit-n-finish issues...didn't actually think my battery was going to fit at first, really had to cram everything in. I can't speak to the connectivity issue, but I highly encourage you to download BLDC tool and change your PPM and deadband settings...really does make the board more usable and enjoyable and it's not that difficult. I know jack about computers or electronics and I was able to figure it out. For me it changed the board from a thrilling, but somewhat nerve racking experience to a fun cruising machine with tons of power on tap that I can ride for miles at a time.

Honestly he had mostly legitimate claims except for the assembly. The nuts and bolts on a pre-built Esk8 should be double/triple checked no matter what. Expecting them to be perfect is unreasonable and fool-hardy. Buying a diy Esk8 that is pre-assembled is STILL A DIY.

As much as I would like to agree with you, As much as I also strongly recommend my customers get into the habit of checking over their boards before riding it.... at the end of the day.....the responsibility is 100% mine! to make sure I deliver exceptionally built products that don't need anything to be done....

I can't expect people to praise me for awesome products if they are not truly awesome! So I have some work to do and I will not stop until I have the best eboard on the market in terms of performance, technology & build quality. I'm not here to be mediocre.. I am here to be the best.

Still, if you buy a car and hear a screech/sequel when braking/turning, its your job to identify it and bring in into a dealership/mechanic shop so they can fix it. If its under warranty you dont have to pay, if not they its out of pocket. Same with Esk8s. While you dont have to do any real work, just like with electric skateboards, commonsense goes a long way.

You have good parts quality, but apparently poor assembly. That is different and not a emphasis of the type of service you provide.

The new layout isn't that different from the current one and the capacitor board is missing.
If I'm correct it's essential for the VESC.
The micro USB on the side is a great idea!

no unfortunately this design won't be in the next batch of raptors, the internal module is actually a full enclosed waterproof ABS hard case. The mold cost alone is about 30-40k. It will be awesome though! It will make building a raptor extremely quick. There will be capacitors built in. Everything is fully enclosed.

I would happily take a retail sales price increase on your final product if all these were implemented.
This comes from someone who is completely no hands-on though.

Really looking forward to hearing some good reviews, clean of the minor setbacks, on your 2nd batch of raptors to encourage me to get one myself.

Keep up the amazing work!!!

How many sold in the second batch?  I'm really hoping to see a good number of reviews, and video reviews.  Testing the actual range, actual speed, braking and now linear the speed control is, durability, build quality, if all issues were resolved, etc.  On paper the raptor is the best in the market, and I'd pay a bit more than the boosted dual plus I own granted if everything just works.  But I'm waiting until everything just works.

The retail price is $1500USD i don't think it will go higher than this.... maybe if I offer the 10S4P battery there will be some extra cost.. it might be like an upgrade option though. maybe $100 more for 33% extra battery

Technically due to the delays of the first batch, the 2nd batch basically became the First batch... So the next batch, which will ship at end of month (will be the 2nd batch) will have all these problems below resolved.

**here are the problems that won't exist in next batch**
1. bad reception due to carbon fiber in lid, new lids have been developed.
2. remote controllers not custom tuned in each raptor, will tune each one individually.
3. loose bolts on some drive trains, we have a new & very strict QC process to double check everything thrice.
4. some bad switches in the batteries (6of30), this has been resolved, old switch no longer being used. (actually the battery is a updated design that has a new BMS design which will make the battery slightly lighter in weight and slightly more compact)
5. No extra holes drilled in deck to accommodate for different trucks.this was ugly and served no advantage.
6. Low voltage cut-off will not be the job of BMS, it will be controlled by the VESC, there will be a soft cut-off so that people get some warning before the board turns off.
7. Maybe ill de-tune the power a tad... lots of people complained it was too powerful...

Okay, so I've been learning to ride this beast a little now, and can cough up a few humble suggestions...

First off, anything that can make both mini-USB connectors accessible on the dual VESC's would be a big plus.  Yes, I have the special "down under" USB cable, but the controller readings via BLDC only seem to be available when connected to the master VESC, which is the harder-to-connect-to one.

Next, the little rectangle of plexiglass that protects the SPACE Cell LCD readout wasn't secured, and quickly disappeared somewhere in some rough asphalt.  I fashioned a replacement, and glued it in with JB Weld.  Problem solved.

The controller settings as shipped threw me on my ass instantly and impolitely.  As noted in #2, dialing in the controller settings before shipping would avoid anal bruising.  :weary:

Personally, I think folks are fooling themselves to think that they're gonna buy this Ferrari and be able to race it full speed without tinkering.  I knew what I was buying, bought it, received it after months of lusty dreams, and immediately reconfigured it to match my own limited ability at the moment.  And yes, I'll crank it up to full power soon!  This ain't yer mama's e-board!

I can't express how much I love the open-source architecture and design of this thing.  @onloop is the dude!!!

Do not crank it down. That was one of the features that separated it from other boards. It needs to be high performance. Just make it easier to adjust the ride settings.

Any chance you will be fitting a raptor with dual REAR 6372 r-spec 2.0 motors soon (with the respective trucks to fit them)?

Those would be some crazy wide trucks. My two Tacon BF 160 6364's would need 11 inch trucks to fit a dual rear configuration, so I would assume two r-spec 2.0's would need 12 inch trucks which would be crazy wide and a ridiculous amount of power. Unless you weigh like 350 lbs, that's just complete overkill and expensive.

Sure.  I had already planned on doing a full video review, discussing range and such.  Timing is a bit of a problem in that I feel I need to spend a fair amount of quality time on the board first in order to do a fair review, but the weather here hasn't exactly been cooperative.

To "kind of" address your question, the short of it is that I'm not getting the range I wanted or expected, and I'm not exactly sure why.  I know there are lots of factors that contribute to range (or lack thereof), and I had hoped to try a few things to see if I could figure it out (the issue could be something other than the battery pack itself).

I don't want to hijack this thread, so if you want more info, or if there are any other specific video requests, just PM me.  :smile:

Agreed, lots of factors affect range, but curious what your range has been? My longest ride to date has been just over 6 miles and I had 70% left showing. I know not to expect a linear draw, but I'm thinking 12 miles on a full charge is reasonable. I'm about 210lbs and have mild hills in my area (100-150 foot elevation gain).

I have tendered to mix it up, but I do tend to coast  alot. The regenerative braking works well and always seems to put back some more power. If your doing more full throttle its only logical that you will eat through the battery life.

Im yet to get the range as per spec, but thats just due to not going further. I am surprised its meant to get 30km, as I am light, so should be getting that easily.

30 km (18 miles) is a great range!!  I'm 140 lbs and hoping I can get that, although I know it wont' happen at full throttle.  If could get 10 miles at full throttle that would be great though.  I have a boosted dual plus and the range and max speed is the limiting factor for me right now.  

I think the raptor needs more publicity and more buyers.  I'm thinking of going in 3rd batch, and I would surely do a video review to get it more publicity.  I'm wondering if onloop could keep up with increased demand while providing a solid product with excellent quality control.  Sending your board back to Australia from the US for repairs or issues seems unrealistic.

Since my attempt to prevent thread hijacking has failed, I'll go ahead and respond, LOL.

I live around 11 miles from work, on top of what most people would call a seriously big hill.  If I start at the top of my hill, I can make it to work with ~15% - 20% battery left. That commute took around 55 mins.  I cannot make it back up the hill coming from work (the hill alone takes about 35% battery).

If I start at the bottom of my hill, it's ~9.5 miles to work.  I made it one day with about 5% battery left (50 mins), but the next time I ran out of battery after about 9 miles and had to push the rest of the way (NOT fun, BTW...).  The temp on this commute was about 45-47 F, and it took about 40 mins (as you can see, I'm going faster as I gain confidence).

About my commute...  It's mostly flat with just a couple small overpasses, but about 1/2 of my commute is in a bike lane or on the road (where there is no bike lane), where the pavement is rough and the is a fair amount of little tiny rocks (which destroyed a set of belts already).  The temperature hasn't been above 60 F on any of the commutes, and I read that temps below 60 reduce Li battery capacity significantly, but until it warms up, I won't know for sure if that's part of the issue.  Also, I push start EVERY time, and I accelerate fairly slowly (to try and conserve battery).

My conclusion thus far is that if you want to go fast, under what I would call normal, real-world conditions, you will get maybe 10 miles.  If you limit your speed to 10mph, you would probably be able to go much farther (but where's the fun in going slow?!?).

One thing I've really noticed is that the dual motors draw a significant amount current.  Under full load with a full battery, the voltage drops enough that the fuel gauge reads 35%-40% less than when not under any load.  In other words, if I have 90% batter showing when I turn the board on, it will read ~50% when I'm cruising at full speed.  That's a LOT of current draw to cause the voltage to drop so much!  (the fuel gauge is based on the voltage)  For this reason, I've been wondering if a 10s4p battery pack would be better suited for the dual motors, because the current draw would be spread out over more individual cells, hopefully resulting in less voltage sag.  For those who may not know, generally, the more current a Li cell provides, the lower it's capacity.  For example, if you discharge a single cell at 1 amp, it's capacity would be X, but if you discharge it 5 amps, it's capacity would be LESS than X.  Therefore, theoretically, 33% more cells (4p vs. 3p) should yield more than 33% additional capacity,  BTW - I think this is also why the Raptor Mono has better range - it discharges the cells at a lower amperage...

As you know, Riding slower means you travel less distance in a given time. To get better range try to keep your average speed over 25km/h (15ml/h), most of my range testing is done at top speed.

You want to keep the motor spinning at max RPM as long as possible. So minimal stopping & starting and always riding at full throttle when possible. 

If you have an incline ahead try to hit it at top speed & maintain momentum.

Wind resistance is a major issue at top speed, try to tuck and angle your body to become more aerodynamic. Reduce your weight as much as possible as 10kg makes a big difference if you are already a larger rider. For instance riding side by side with my mate who is 105kg was a big difference in range compared with me at 95kg.

hope this helps, let me know if you get some better results.

Otherwise... the 10S4P pack will be available soon.

Thanks for the suggestions!  It's not really possible (traffic lights and all) to maintain top speed on my commute - there's a lot of stopping or at least slowing down.  Should I try to go as fast as possible still, or is there a better target speed?  Also, I can take a route that utilizes the bike path more, but it's 2 additional miles of distance.  Do you think that's a reasonable trade off?

Lastly, what about top speed over the rougher pavement vs. going more like 15mph?  I've been thinking that slower is more efficient because as I've gone faster my range has decreased.

Just about any site that tests these batteries will typically post a graph showing the capacity at various discharge rates.  Here is just one example (there are many such tests/sites):  http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650CurvesAll%20UK.html

Not specifically.  As I understand it (I'm NOT an expert on batteries - just barely knowledgeable), the "C" rating is the constant amperage the individual cell is rated to deliver.  I was simply referring to the principle whereby higher current draw results in slightly lower capacity.  The point I was trying to make is that if you go faster (i.e. demand more current from the battery cells), capacity will be slightly less than if you go slower.  However, as Jason (onloop) has pointed out, motor efficiency is also a factor and needs to be considered.  Meaning at slower speeds, it may actually consume more battery due to the motor running at a less efficient RPM (at least that's what I understood him to be saying).

At the cell level the different brands & models of 18650 type battery tend to have lower C when they are Greater MAH Capacity, however, this becomes less obvious when new technology is bringing better capacity & discharge rates into the market

Samsung 25R & LG He2 at 2500mah offer very high 8C so 20A discharge
Samsung 29E at 2900mah is just 2c for peak of approx 6A

The relatively NEW Samsung 30Q at 3000mah is 5c for peak of 15A

So in this case higher capacity mah tends to mean lower discharge rates.



ALSO, the faster you discharge each cell (more current used) the quicker the battery is depleted to an unusable voltage. So larger capacity batteries say 2900mah with lower C rating might not actually last as long as a 2500mah with higher C rating when being discharged at higher rates. So it requires more in parallel which becomes hard when building an ESK8 due to limited space 10S4P is probably the MAX

So the question is what is the usable capacity of the cell? vs what is its labeled capacity. More MAH per cell does not mean a battery will last longer (More total mah due to cells in parallel is different)... At a cell level, it is all about performance under load.. this is why I choose the cells with higher C rating. There are only two cells that are feasible for a 10S3P eboard battery, they are ones that offer 8C (20A each cell) any less and I don't think they are a good option.

That is when a 10S4P battery becomes interesting, because it opens the door to using lower C rated cells as there are more in parallel. But if I build a 10S4P it will be using 8C rated cells & it is guaranteed to be 33% more capacity on the label & in real life, but might end up running longer then expected due to a lower discharge current per cell....

some more testing will need to be done to find the answer. I think @whitepony has done some 10S4P testing with 8C rated 18650. 

At the end of the day 10S4P is going to be very nice just expensive!

[/quote]

yeah that's what I was saying. 

More Specifically the amount of times you stop then start again combined with lower average top speed. The hardest job of the eboard is getting the load back up to a high speed, sustaining it is easier because the motor is working at its optimal RPM. So once at high speed the load is much lower on the cells. And, of course, once you are at top speed you travel further in less time.

The problem then becomes wind resistance, any faster than about 50-60km/h starts to become a major problem.

So MAX speed of approx 50km/h is a nice limit! (any faster is dangerous & also requires huge amount of power to overcome the wind resistance) This is why I build the raptor boards to achieve this 50km/h max (about 45km/h in real life) speed on full charge, it is also very close (8000rpm) to the theoretical optimal RPM (8600) for small Brushless Outrunner.

Any Raptor owners try removing a raiser? Every time I go for a foot brake (which isn't that often) I nearly eat shit because the board is so much higher than I'm expecting. Looking at the board, it appears the motors may be in danger of rubbing against the motor wires with just one raiser, but was curious if any owners (or Onloop) had given it a shot...

I replaced one riser with a softer 1/8 inch riser, but I had the motors rubbing the wires on turns because my wires weren't laying completely flat along street side of deck. I used a heat gun to heat the hot glue holding wires in place as they exist the battery enclosure and repositioned the wires, so they lay flat. Good to go now. It's worth it imho softer ride and noticeably lower to the ground.

1) Should I buy it created all together, piece by piece from the website or buy the parts in the kit and buy additional parts not included like battery and carbon longboard?

2) Which is cheaper bought all together or by kit?

3) Will newer styles becoming out like larger batteries and design but same specs or just small fixes that a computer can fix so I should buy now and not instead of 6 months?
