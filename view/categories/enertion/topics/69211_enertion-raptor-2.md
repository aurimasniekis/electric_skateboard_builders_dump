Can the enertion raptor 2 board be changed to a step down board?  Would all the components fit on a step down board?

The guts can be fit on a drop down or A drop through.  Jus to depends on how much work youâ€™re willing to put in 

It could but you would need to find a way to route the rear motor wires. They currently route through the baseplate. You would just need to route them in the more traditional esk8 way.

Many people have already installed this on a Evo deck hell Moja put this set up on a drop down deck before it was out to customers.

Can I ask where you got this deck @JohnnyMeduse cause I have been searching high and low for one everywhere on liner and can't seem to find one, did Omen go out of business or something....?

Thanks in advance brotha!
