Dear Humans,

since I need new Stock of Bestech BMSes, why not make it a good oldfashioned GB.
Should you have a dire need for a different model, lmk and we'll see if we can add it.
_

Offered choices (so far):

**10s:**
![2014111105356314|450x338](upload://it1sWtTH5UxbPGgdRxrPzNQ92nU.jpg)
HCX-D239 - charge only - without eswitch
http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D239.html

**12s:**
![2012122313619226|450x338](upload://5TFdVsqjFwQmyDmCMe3OgnR3pm1.jpg)
HCX-D140 - charge only - without eswitch
http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/BMS-D140.html
_

Cutoff Voltages (conservative I think):
Over charge detection voltage: 4.20V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.10V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage; 2.80V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 2.90V+/0.1V
_

These prices are good guesstimates. Obviously in EU you never know exactly how much the customs office will make you pay. Not looking to make a profit so any changes larger than 2€ will be refunded/charged.
_

Prices in €uros
BMS charge only	17
Paypal + Shipping + Taxes	8

German shipping tracked	6
EU shipping tracked	9
International shipping tracked	16

Untracked is dirt cheap. If you want that, let me know.

Those who want to participate, fill in dat Google Form soon, I am eager to place the order.

If your battery is 10s, then you need a 10S bms, and a 10s charger.... same goes for 12s ?? Or what do you mean ?
