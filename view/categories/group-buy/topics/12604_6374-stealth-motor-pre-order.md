After running the last few group buys, I made an order for 50 motors and sold all of the 6374.

*Let me know if you guys are interested in the 5065 group buy, shipping 2-4 weeks*

**6354 / 6374:**

what sort of can style does your factory offer for 5065's? 
I was going to get some custom wound motors but I kinda wanted the ollin/alien style closed can.

I finally got the 6354 from the last buy up and running on 12s single, its pulling nicely!

Ok looks like the 6374 is the only thing getting real attention. Price is $79.99 plus $6.80 shipping. Shipping should be 2.5-3 weeks (to me). I would need a lot of participation on this, as of the moq I have to meet. 

How does it work? You simply purchase the motor through the link I provided below. It make order management 100x easier, I can also update status and tracking numbers when available. 

Pre-Order Here: https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/

Ok I worked out a deal with the manufacturer, delayed shipment for half of the motors, so I only have to order 20 and they hold the other 20 for me. So I wouldn't worry about the MOQ. Let me know when you guys ordered so I know who is who on the forum!

The motors are perfectly fine. I have sold over 150 and only had 2 problems, one with @barajabali he didn't notify me about a problem and took the motor apart and ruined the bearing. The ONLY other issue was with @Jinra and I sent him a new motor. 

They motors are very high quality. Similar to 

I have also received many compliments on the motors performance. I assure you the are high quality and work perfect.

The motor I got the bearing wasn't pushed all the way into the housing and the circlip wouldn't push in, while pushing the bearing in I ruined it. So I purchased a new bearing and it still wouldn't push all the way in. He wouldn't return the defective one or the brand new ones. 

Beware- he won't allow you to return brand new motors just because "you don't want them anymore" I even offered to pay a restocking fee. The level of service is terrible. 

When a battery breaks and one of my customers open the pack to try to fix it, do you know what I say? I say "thanks for trying but let me take it from here" and I go ahead and pay for return shipping to fix it or return it fully" (granted my batteries never have issues because they aren't Chinese garbage) HE does not carry that moto, he acts like he is a large corporation and does not honor returns, service, or any type of reconciliation.

*i have literally never complained about any company on this forum ever because they have all been reasonable. It's not about the money- I took $110 loss. I could care less about the money. When I buy- I buy service.

[/quote]

That is a rare occurrence in shipping, and before contacting me you opened the motor. If you immediately contacted me I would have told you how to properly fix it, or u would have refunded you and taken it back. **I even offered to pay you for the bearing you broke.**

As for the not refunding motors you are not using. Before you purchased them you asked if you no longer wanted them, if would you be able to return them. I then said that I would do my best but no gaurentees. I am a small business and reinvesting all profits, while providing the customer quality parts at an affordable price. 

On the battery side, what company replaces items after the customer takes them apart, brakes a bearing, and then wants a refund? You may with your batteries but that is a product you manufacturer yourself. You also make more profit. 

And the best thing about this whole situation is the fact that you threatened to audit, sue, and file bank claims. **THEN YOU SAID YOU HAD MY IP AND FULL NAME. ** I don't care about the IP because it always changes. But is that the type of moderate we want on the forum? Someone who threatens with an IP? 

You then proceeds to create a topic, bash my motors and company, and then close the topic so I could not reply and defend my self. See anything wrong with this situation? This should be the last we talk about this in this topic. If you want to talk further PM me as its off topic.

IT was not a shipping issue, I know how to fix motors so I went ahead and attempted to fix it.  You keep claiming its because of shipping,  a circlip will not fall off due to shipping, it is there to hold the bearing in incase of impacts.  

You would not have refunded me, because you ALSO gave @Jinra an extremly hard time to return his goods. 

You did not take the motors back because "I cant return them jsut because i dont want them" NOT because you are "reinvesting profits" liar. 

 My company has that level of service unlike yours, My company fixes it at all costs.  My end goal is to get you riding.  You can talk to any one of my customers. I have ever left them feeling like they got cheated.  I have  ZERO bad reviews not even one! But you on the other hand,  After i posted that, i had a few people contact me telling me that im not the only one who got cheated. 

You sent me broken merchandise and refused to honor it. That is the fact. And you wouldnt return the merchandise that had nothing wrong with it. 

I created a topic to sell my items that you wouldnt return for a price that they are worth ONLY $50. that is all not a penny more.  I closed the topic when the goods were sold. That is how we do things here. 

Though i am a moderator, I am still a consumer and i can speak about the terrible service you gave me. And on top of it all you asked me pay you as friends as family so i couldnt even file a paypal claim.

Thats fine that you offered,  I still paid for it.

the people should know what they're getting into, this is extremely ON TOPIC.[quote="JLabs, post:33, topic:12604"]

I can assure you, I know more than you about motors.  I know how to fix motors. Your advice was "push it back in" as if i didnt already try that. There was a deformity in the housing which didnt allow for that to happen. If i cant fix it. I PROMISE that you cant.

@barajabali is right and if you are going to sell chinese stuff you should be prepared for the cost. As for barajabali as a moderator, he has contributed more to my build than anyone else on this forum, and when everyon was saying what wouldnt work he offered a solution that is currently working better than anything ive ever rode. The IP thing is him being mad, you come to the forum with your products post about how great your srvice is and your motors are, then the first cutomer that has a problem with them you turn down the help? I had a similar problem with my battery from Torqueboards, opening his 6s 4p to try and solve the problem and not removing anything but just to find the problem point. He said I couldnt return it for repairs, and offered no help with diagnosing the problem. I will now never buy another product for him. So basically unless you switch to a better manufacturer or make them yourself , prepare for issues and having money to offer refunds, or at least repairs.

I can GUARANTEE it was a shipping issue. I receive one or two motors per shipment that do not have the circlip on. I simply push the bearing back in place, and reattach the circlip. There is NOTHING wrong with the quality of the motors. How do you know about my knowledge of motors? 

What you do with your 'company' is your thing not mine. I only have one bad review, yours. That's it. Because I told you I couldn't refund you if you no longer wanted them? And because you broke a bearing trying to fix a problem that did not require you to take the motor apart? 

I can 100% guarantee that I am reinvesting all profits so do NOT call me a liar. 

I asked you for pictures and you never sent them (After you replaced the bearing). 

I did not turn down anyone. I replaced a motor for @Jinra Yes, I asked him a bunch of questions, but I DID send him a new motor! You know why I sent him a new motor? Because there was actually a manufacturing default. You damaged a bearing BEFORE notifying me of a problem!!! I then offered to repay you for the bearing! 

I challenge anyone else who bought motors from me to speak up here. I can't have this ruining my reputation.

I participated in @JLabs  remote group buy and battery group buy and was satisfied with what I got.  That being said I thought he was just organizing group buys, didn't realize he was running a business.

In my opinion I think it depends on what you were buying.  If it is a group buy where a dude is just doing it to get himself and everyone a cheaper price and really isn't gaining anything from it, then if you get a dud, then I feel like that's just tough luck and you can't expect the organizer to be burdened with the cost.

If it is a business, that is a different story. For me it is unclear what @JLabs is doing now, so maybe you can clarify? I think that will help the community figure out  where we stand on the issue.

maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think @JLabs made a profit from the battery group buy that I participated in.  I was able to get some Basen 26650 at a lower price shipped form liion, so he definitely helped me out there by organizing that.

Not on anyone's side here at all. But personally for future customers and myself, I would like @JLabs to clarify when he is running a "group buy" if this is actually a group buy, or if this is a pre-order system for him.  It makes a big difference to me since one is a service for the community and one is a business.  Both are fine, but I just want to know which one I am getting into when buying stuff.   I think others would like to know this too.

I have run many group buys, remotes, batteries, and the first few batches of motors. None of which I made money. I do all I can to help the community. I am now starting to go from group buys to running a business. I have stated above that this was a pre order and it also clearly states it when they go to pre-order.

I can respect that. The title of the thread does say "Group Buy" though which is why I was confused.  Given that you previously were running group buys for no profit and now are changing it to a business, I think using the title "Group Buy" can be misleading to people on here.

Personally I don't think it's fair to call it a group buy anymore when you're making a profit.  But just my opinion. From other forums I'm on for Mustangs, group buy always means the organizer isn't making a profit, or if they do, they disclose they are taking $X per order to cover their time.

Anyways, now that I've got to the bottom of that I'm satisfied and thanks for organizing those group buys previously!  I do appreciate your work there.

I totally understand. I was doing a group buy for the 5065 and a pre order for the 6374 to start, and because of the lack of interest I stopped the group burly and was only doing pre orders. My fault on that one. I have changed the title to only say pre-order. 

I also stated right before the link "Pre-Order Here:"

I don't know anything about jlabs but agree there on @barajabali , i know a guy from Chicago and bara helped him fix his board no charge just to help him out...so bara is definitely a stand up guy.  I would take his word over others and I would have no problem giving him my money cuz I know he will provide his customers with excellent service.  But that's off topic.  Don't mean to hijack the thread here.

My advice to any vendor would be that never ever skimp on customer service.  Before you even go into a business make that your priority.  Unsatisfied customers is what can ruin your reputation and thus your business.  So issues should be resolved without much resistance.

Yes, and that is what is happening. I don't understand why he is saying the motors are low quality when he has never even used them. I get that the bearing was not pushed all the way in, but he took the motor apart before contacting me.

```
Question: if it was a shipping issue why not just take the return and follow-up with the mail carrier on insurance? Also, why not take the restocking fee on the 3 other motors? If you're confident in your product could have made more profit on those motors in the long-term (restocking fee + sale price).

On your reputation, the forum can be forgiving if they see a vendor learn from their mistakes and do the right thing in the end. For example, look at how zmoney / AXLE handled criticism of their VESCs - he took the criticism and tried to make it right. So, you should ask yourself how much your reputation is worth and if it's worth losing over a couple hundred dollars. 

Full disclosure: Bara has really helped me out, we've met in person and he's been stand-up in every aspect. So, I'm not entirely impartial here.

Guys, I think your standards and expectations are a bit too high. If you buy something from Enertion or TB I don't think it would be that simple to return it just cause you don't want it anymore. Second, if you open the motor before asking the vendor to replace it, so you ruin the warranty, it's your fault. 
What should barajabali have done? Tell Jlabs as soon as he discovered the problem, wait for a refund/replacement/help fixing it, take photos and videos and then act. If every shop replaced broken items after they were opened/modified, everybody would buy them, test them in every way ruining them, and then send them back. That's not how shops work. If you want to fix it by yourself before asking, you ruin your warranty, it's not that hard.
At the moment, about 1% of the motors has had problems, and 0,5% of buyers has had problems with the vendor. I don't think that's enough to ruin somebody's reputation, so please stop.
Not everybody is @barajabali or LHB or @chaka  with that great customer service, cause not everybody has time/resources/need. None of the other shops, like TB or Enertion, would have helped you in this situation, so there's no need to go against @JLabs
If you have problems, take evidence and ask. That's how normal shops handle faulty items, don't come here telling us "my customer service is better", cause you make them pay double the price just for that service, that is included if you are careful enough not to do everything by yourself.

So $75 for a motor garunteed to break or $100 for a motor that comes with good insurance behind it. At the end of the day @JLabs isn't selling quality parts he's buying from a manufacturer. Yes I get what ur saying about being a small company but that's a hit he has to take, unless he'd rather end up with a crap load of motors and no customer.

What are you talking about? The motor are not junk, only one person had a real problem and I replaced the motor. In fact, they are from the same manufacturer as  so do NOT come on here and bash me when A. You have never even used my motors and B. Have no facts or context to back up what you are saying.

And u know what the funny part is, DIY charges $120 for the 6374 so that really means you don't know what ur talking about. I do not appreciate you bashing me when you don't have facts.

The numbers don't lie. 0.006% have had an issue so far, and when it was a real issue I replaced the motor. So I am willing to take the loss when it is needed. And on the customer service, I have only had one complaint, which is an even small percentage because I have sold over 300 parts (0.003%). I'd say that's pretty good.

If you buy something from Enertion or TB I don't think it would be that simple to return it just cause you don't want it anymore.

Thank you. I see many threads on here where people have brand new parts from TB and Enertion, they simply just sell them.

Actually I spent exactly $500 on Tb parts including a switch, esc, battery and the only thing that still works is the pulleys and that was after a week of use

Edit: as for your parts the Motor you have is not high quality and if ud like to send me the specs go ahead I would be willing to bet however that an sk3 is better, the only real service you offer is a shorter wait time on parts since everything you're buying is coming straight from ur manufacturer then u pop it in a box and ship it off. Ur an overated middle man. We could argue all day however I have money to make so I'll leave u with this, apologize and try to make things right, or deal with the repercussions.

And how is that relevant to the topic?

I'm not quite getting what you're trying to say.
