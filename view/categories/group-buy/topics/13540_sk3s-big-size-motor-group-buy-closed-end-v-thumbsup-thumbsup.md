Hello guys,

I was able to contact a manufacturer that makes Turnigy's SK3's6374 192kvs to Hobbyking. I will be purchasing two motors for myself. I got a price for $65 for each motor (5-10 units). Thats without the shipping for all motors. If anyone else is interested......let me know. This by itself is just a single buy for myself but can have people joining in with me.

EDIT:
Also just to add, I am not making any money off this, same cost to me is to you + shipping. I am just saving money. I have to work out warranty with  them and then will see.
And one more thing, I only wanted to do this is because I was actually bout to buy 2 from hobbyking but they ran out right when I opened the link again as of this moment they still out of stock.

EDIT2:
Please fill out this google form if your interested/committed.
[GROUP MOTOR BUY RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLQrhO2w2V4ZzozgawPj16MdMfmuojBPgwHMMO5DvdKR0GMg/viewform)

EDIT3:
These are genuine Turnigy SK3 Motors direct from the manufacturer as quoted (by their salesperson or engineer?). The manufacturer is SunRay
http://sunraytechnology.com/

EDIT 4: **The PRICE IS $65, NOT $68.**

EDIT 5: "The keyway can be added for free of charge."

EDIT 6: "The motor wires can be replaced by silicon wire."

Ive seen this before. Make sure to add a keyway on it. The manufracturer can do this.

Also ask if they can include silicone phase wires coming out from the motor instead of continuing the copper windings. Seen that before too, for an extra cost of course.

I had contacted them a long time ago, before I started selling motors. If you want a keyway and silicon wires the moq was 50 or 100, I cant remember which but it was really high.

Would you be able to get the 6354 260KV's? https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6354-260kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

If yes, I might be down for two. :)

Wish they would make a 6354 with a lower kv , something like 200-220 kv

or a 5065 with 8mm shaft.

don't do it. I have 2 sk3's that broke because of huge design flaw.

the whole front plate that the motor mount is connected to is only held on by 3 m3 screws which seat the tiny bearings. now they are just 2 heavy paper weights....even boring out the broken screws it will just happen again...

there are better designed motors for the same price or less!

I cannot agree on your points!

For me and many people out here the SK3 is a working beast!
I did not hear many problems about the SK3 motors just good! The only downside are the stiff motor cables....

thats fine. i added more info on this on the other thread...

I will say the sk3 performed very well while it lasted. but 3 months for 1, and 1 month for the second is not good to me. motors should not be disposable.

besides sk3 **were** popular because they are easy to find/ship.

But now they're are many more options, some are even cheaper and perform as well/better with no modifications and with sensors!

I have seen the loosening of the screws at the top of the sk3 my self, but this happens just when there is a big wobble on the belt that produces excessive vibrations, not due to any motor design flaws. 

The SK3 so far is the more reliable motor for this application, excellent design that have more bearing than any other motor around, air cooling sistem that no other motor has and incredibly power. 
The only down are the lack of a key slot and short shaft. The stiff cables I don't consider to be a minus for eMTB that I like to mount this beast :imp:

i'll say that could be the cause of the first failure. but I made sure to check alignment regularly on the 2nd. having to disassemble and check these screws regularly is just too much work....

and i'm still not sure about the fan's real world benefit unless its stuffed in a carvon hub which btw avoids this issue...

also vibration would be less of a problem on emtb since you have that air to ride on and more clearance...

Once the screws come loose the first time you need to apply blue or red loctite to them. 

At the end this are really good motors but some of them are bound to come out with issues. At the end this is like the wine the best one is the one you like :wink:

65is for the motor. Once I get the shipping to me I will divide the shopping by all motors.  And then I will add that and the individual shipping to the motor,  which if I am doing right will still be cheaper then hobbyking.
I am now confirmed  for 4 6374-192kv motors. Anyone else going to join?

 I am looking into the forms issue,  thanks for letting me know.

I personally am not a fan of the sk3 they are ok but were never manufactured for what they are being used for on eboards. did you try alien power systems? or torque boards. I'm running a 3200 watt 80 amp moor 6374 , course I will double this soon for a 6400 watt dual motor set up , 68 is a good price tho. see em for 83 and up . whats the kv on the sk3 ?

Wow, cool deal you've made! I think I would be in for some motors like this (with keyway and silicon wires) sometime in the future.. So I do hope you keep ordering more or someone else takes the lead after this group buy!

Though, Im also from europe, so that might pose a problem.. but perhaps you get this sorted out, as one user here wanted to ship to germany, where he lives..

btw, nice touch :smiley:

Seems like a common complaint about the SK3 motors is that their shafts are short. Could they provide longer shafts, as they did for the [Trampa-branded motors](http://www.trampaboards.com/136-kv-2400w-dc-brushless-motor-6364-61-p-12967.html) they supplied?

If so, I'd buy a 6374 149kv.

Motors are heavy and shipping is expensive. @wmj259 You also forgot that you have to pay import tax and VAT applies. 
When you ship the motors to Europe, customers will have to pay duties and/or VAT again. Make sure the motors are RHoS and have a CE Certificate in that case. A group buy is trade, even if you don't make any profit. You got to provide an invoice btw. If you and five of your fellows buy something that might be fine. Manufacturing something on purpose, importing it, shipping it around the planet is trade, no excuses!  Warranty, unlimited Liability, VAT, duties, sticking to standards (e.g. FCC, RHoS), having a registered business, insurance.... That all sits on your shoulders. Shipping something by air from HK to USA, maybe then to Europe is a bit expensive in the end, especially when you ship heavy motors. I think you should straighten out your numbers and be honest to your buyers and yourself. Price will end up way higher, you will have a lot of trouble and email conversation and might end up sitting on a couple of 100$ unpaid invoices. Something always goes wrong and you will pay for that.

I will be finished with exams on this upcoming Tuesday 12/20/2016. :sweat_smile::sweat_smile: Boy did they mess up my sleeping/eating/......... schedules. 

I will be asking everyone to confirm their orders. I again apologize for the delays. I just had a lot of special requests from many people for specific things and a little life things to take care of. I was able to get all the motors with key-ways and silicone wiring's so all can enjoy. The motor shaft specs are posted above and on the main # post. 

If you have any edits to make please just tag my name and specify what you need to be changed. 
If no changes are needed please post a confirmation. 

I will add details on the shipping in next few days before sending the final order.

Could they shift the position of the keyway inboard by 10 mm? With a long shaft, I wouldn't mount the pulley so close to the end. I happen to have an 8 x 3 millimeter key, so the size of the keyway is longer than I need, but it will work fine.

@SteveS,
So if the shaft is 38.5-mm long from the motor housing, you want it 28.5-mm away from the motor housing, with the same key-way dimensions, if I understood correctly.

@wmj259 Not quite. I'm asking if the measurement that is 4.1mm in your first post could be increased to 14.1mm. That way, the keyway is about the same distance from the motor as it is on the standard-length shaft. Does that make sense?

@CamBo, these are 8mm shafts. 

I need to have a **minimum** quantity of 5 motors for the same extended shaftkeyway specs and same KV rating. 

So far there are 4 motors for the 149kv with extended shafts. I am willing to buy another one so it meets the MOQ and just sell it on the marketplace. I have not asked for the price for the 149 sensored with extended shaft version yet. **Heads up on that price as it will be higher.**

I changed the spreadsheet around to add another column. 
Unfortunately I have customized the orders to the manufacturer too much that they are a little more enforcing of the minimum order requirement.
Please put a final eye on your row in the spreadsheet. I am just really cautious so I don't end up too much in the hole if someones order is incorrect from my editing. (Please dont be mad at me :) )
@DilatedPupils, @f1rstb81, @Rob69de, @Rob.Endless, @steves, @CamBo.  
I will ask for the final invoice from the manufacturer.

The normal items (not customized) will arrive on or before January 18
The special items (customized) will arrive on or before February 25.

There are small details I am getting sorted out on the invoice. And then will post it up. Will have to see what category these fall under for duty tax.
Here's the bill. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/3/b349be2bdd8fe61da0defd099706db73698d5ddb.png" width="355" height="499">.

To reduce shipping costs, how about consolidating the customized and non-customized shipments? 

If we can't reduce shipping costs, I'm more than willing to pay my share of extra shipping costs. To me, the value in this group buy has always been in the custom extras, rather than the potential for a discount from Hobbyking's prices.

I all those motors that are rounded up to 5 are on me to meet the MOQ. 
I am so far getting:
-2 192KV's for myself, 
-1 149KV's to raise the MOQ for that, and 
-2 260KV's to MOQ for that. 

I am in pretty deep for just meeting the MOQ's, but I will just be selling these on the marketplace to recover it back.
If you want to go out that's no problem for me, I will arrange something with @Lambjr088. Just let me know asap. 

I was pretty late on deadlines for this buy, so to those that have been waiting on me, I apologize.

@SteveS, I was told that they will ship out on one big package, will see around with other shipping companies to see how much it will be. 

I'll give them a deposit for my motors ask them to take pictures to see how it goes.

@wmj259 Shouldn't the sensor wire be considerably longer than the other three wires? The other three wires only need to reach the wires coming off the VESC, while the sensor wire need to reach all the way to the middle of the VESC.

Regarding shipping cost, weight would seem to be natural in that the shipping cost is based on weight.

They are actually 23-cm maximum I can get, sorry if i mislead above. I will figure out the shipping afterwards. I just don't want the price for you guys to actually be much higher versus hobbyking's stock. I'll see how shipping works out.

Total approximate weight of the motors comes out to roughly
24.5 KG~54lbs.
The motors for me come out to roughly 1/3 of the total weight.

Crap sorry, I have been busy as of late. Yeah, that sensor length is okay. So for sure my order is for two 6374 192kv with all options right? Well, the must have options for me at the very least are, sensors and extended shaft. What is my exact total, I can send payment immediately.

@Rob.Endless your total would be $156.80. I can cover your amount. I am sending in the total payment,  you can just papypal to my username.

Just so you guys know, I put an order in for some custom motors (6)  They came relatively quick (with in 2 weeks) I misread the DWG file that i was sent.  I got all of my requirements met except for the extended shaft.  The shafts i got were 26.5mm long instead of 36mm.  I put an additional order in for 6 40mm shafts to swap out.

They are going on break soon for Chinese new year so i hope that doesnt affect your group buy.  It would be a 20 day delay

Cool, @barajabali will you throw in some more info soon about this (the motors you can obtain)?

Im not entirely US buyer (instead EU) but I still like to see many options. My now most likely sources for motors is either hobbyking or ordering from china.


Plus, the motors I found from china.. is quite unknown, they are called **_racerstar_** and they dont come in the big 6374 / 6364 sizes, max is 6355. 

Hobbyking prices somewhat increased for all the motors it seems.. so unless there is a special trick or sale  / coupon to use (of which I am not aware now as of now).. then hobbyking is out of the list for me now :/ 

Plus, the wires are indeed quite stiff with sk3.. and shafts are not always suitably long, for thicker mounts or pulleys.

I purchased my motors from this same company but on my own- not with the group buy.

The motors i got had the wrong motor shaft length but that was my fault mostly. I told her extended shaft and we just had  different  understanding

Oh ok I get it now why u did not get the long shafts.. they were intended but you just did not double check with them that they got it correct.. 

Anyways, Im really supporting the idea about you making a similar group buy.. it look quite a long time to finalize for this one.. which is just fine but might not always be suitable when the eboard building might get hasty..

Non the less, it seems @wmj259 has built the path now.. so there's not much bad I can tell.. of course, the buyers still have to get their motors.. but the all buy process went pretty structured I think :slight_smile:

  I just see from this now how lenghty this coordinaton / info collection process can be.

I have sent the payment in to their company via bank transfer. It will take 2-4 Business days for it to do its thing. Projected manufacture time is about 40days not including the Chinese New Year coming up, so its still is about 5 weeks. I will keep everyone posted as this goes along. Hopefully I can get them to send pics of what they get done before the Chinese New Year.

@Okami, 
I agree about the lengthy process, I had this groupbuy started in Late November/EarlyDecember and school life got in the way. I have to tip my hat to these people that waited for this to happen. :) 7

@barajabali, 
POST SOME PICS PLEASE!!! Can you tell me how they came packaged so I can figure out shipping and if you paid any taxes/fees on them. Let me know how they work out for you. :slight_smile: 

I have to order much more than I myself needed to help others get what they wanted. I'll end up with like 6-8 extra motors that I don't need. Hopefully, I can get my money back by selling them on the marketplace.

They come in a plastic bag wrapped in bubble wrap in a small white box which is then in a larger shipping box. 

They are authentic sk3's pretty nice just upset I got the wrong shaft.

Alrighty guys, Shipping.
**A.)**
Shipping from them was $157. I took the stock weight for everyones motor configuration based on hobbyking's website, and divided it by the total weight. That gave me a mulltiplier against the total cost 
(Column N, is what you should pay). 
(Column O) is the shipping rounded down to the nearest interval of $5.00.<<< **Is everyone fine with this?**
View here : [SK3 GB Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JCxrelnLVaqHFXkQ_vW4e7xuel2hR9VIUWcS2CWloYU/edit?usp=sharing)
@DilatedPupils, please email me.
@Rob.Endless,     please email me.

**B.)** I also rounded down to the nearest 5th for the pricing aswell.
I calculated the shipping, for those of you that got 2 motors, it may fit inside of this box (based on the dimensions @barajabali provided above.)
-->If it fits inside a Medium Box, [Priority Mail Medium Flat Rate Box - 1](https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?categoryNav=false&navAction=jump&navCount=6&productId=P_O_FRB1&categoryId=subcatMSS_B) it will be $10.00. (~~2MOTORS)
-->If it fits inside a Large Box, [Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box] (https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?productId=P_LARGE_FRB&categoryId=free-shipping-supplies) it will be $15.00 (~~4MOTORS)

They did not start manufacturing over the Chinese new Year which is a bummer but it is their holiday. They ordered parts, that estimated delivery is to me from China. My guess is they added 40 day lead to the day right after the new year without the period of shipping to me.
But Spring season does start in March. :)

@wmj259 Plain silver seems a little too plain. Because these are really SK3 motors with a few tweaks to make them better-suited to e-skating, how about having them etched SK8?! 

To make the design easy, they could use the same graphics as the stickers on SK3 motors or keep things really simple and just etch them SK8 in the SK3 font.

Just to make it look nice I'll just ask them for both laser designs. If everyone's good for it. Those diamonds wont come out in color fyi, it will look the same greyish as the pic above.

Just to clarify with you guys, 
I can either get laser etches on all or none. As its being a sample test for me, (I will have to buy again for it to be a production test I suppose). 

One more thing 
When they refer to:
_6374 and 6354 is OEM customer model no. not our factory part no._ 
 
_6354 (=factory part no.: DT5025)_
 
_6374 (=factory part no.: DT5045): DT5045)_

Also a quick note as for shipping from me to you. 
I had a unfortunate experience with USPS losing my package from @JLabs groupbuy. I had spent roughly $75 on it only to get back $56 from USPS claim service. 

**I WOULD highly recommend** you guys to buy insurance just as an assurance it gets delivered to you guys as these weren't cheap to get especially for those of you who ordered more than 1 motor. 
Will send the receipt in the box.

Thanks for the advice @JLabs. 
If they want me to use a bubble envelope I can do that, but I personally don't want to risk the chance of shafts being damaged or motors being banged up. 

I actually think that no matter what label is put on the package whether it be fragile or glass the workers still end up throwing the package around. To buy a fragile sticker costs $7+. Not sure if it can be put on personally or has to be through USPS.

I wrap the boxes in bubble wrap and the motors are inside a bubble bag that is inside the box.. IMO, it's protected. 

Only time I had an issue was when the box was too big and everything shifted around.

The torque values were listed in kg-cm. To convert to N-m, multiply by gravity (9.81 m/s^2) and divide by 100

So for example, the 6374 149kV had a maximum value of about **34 kg-cm**, which would be **3.3 N-m**

(34 kg-cm)*(9.81 m/s^2)*(1m/100cm) = 34*9.81/100 = 3.3 N-m

.

Or more simply.... just divide by 10 for an approximate vale :slight_smile:

I may be able to fit 4 Motors into a Medium sized box. it will be a tight fit and I can probably slip in a thin film of bubble wrap sheets on each side.
I had these boxes lying around for quite a long time, So I will need to see if these still count as the medium sized 
After checking the website for USPS for box dimensions, I am not sure these are still valid boxes.
There is a post office on my Campus that I can get a box from and redo the boxing. 

Hopefully I will be able to ship out motors by tomorrow.

If everyone can send in the shipping payments that would be great.
@DilatedPupils $38 with insurance
@davidwang $0 (I'll get you insurance)
@CamBo $25 with insurance ( you paid insurance seperately)
@SteveS $25 (I'll cover your insurance)
@Lambjr088 $20+4(insurance)
@barajabali send your payment if your still down for the motor. (let me know if you want insurance its a few bucks)
@Rob.Endless I never got a reply from you. (If not, then your motors go to @PXSS) 
@PXSS are you still down (based on above)?

I have shipped out everyone order, if I  didn't send you a tracking number/insurance pic let me know.

Tracking will probably start working at around 1-2pm today as that when my campuses office drops off at usps branch location.

@CamBo, I got your message will ship out later this week, 
@DilatedPupils, need the shipping payment.

@wmj259: Did you have to pay extra for customs and tax besides the shipping cost? Or was all that included in their shipping cost?

Just a quick quote from online search

A search through usps said it would be

If you can print the label it's fine, but the box comes inside a medium flat rate.

So who here bought one of the SK3 6374-149kv sensored motors?

I will trade you my unsensored SK3 6374-149kv, **plus cash on top**, for your shiny new motor.  My motor has 10AWG silicone wire upgrades with 5mm bullets. It has less than 100 miles on it and works perfectly. I'm just keen to try out a sensored setup

_(long shot... but why not??)_

You can fit a motor inside a flat rate envelope. Just use a literal ton of padding.
**If it fits, it ships**

Would there be a chance you'd do another one of these or help a Europe based GB go ahead?
I'm keen for a few motors with keyways.

Yes, I got mine, thanks! I haven't been able to install it yet, but wanted to note that the mounting plate is slightly deformed. It looks like it happened at some point before you packed and shipped the motors to me (because they seemed well-packed). I'm pretty sure the deformation won't affect the motor in use, but I wanted to flag the issue for now.
