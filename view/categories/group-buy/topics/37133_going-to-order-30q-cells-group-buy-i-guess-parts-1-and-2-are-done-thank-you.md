i need more cells, going to order 30Q from imrbatteries but wanted to see if anyone else needed some.

i may just shoot for the 400 count discount at $3.85 per cell, and sell excess in couples on ebay to vapers.

below is a difference of buying in smaller quantities, and getting in on this group buy.

they use 18650 cells in custom vapes.  like us esk8ers, they need high drain cells and use the same as us, ie 25r, hg2, 30q, etc

nkon does have good prices but after shipping it's nowhere near €2.59.
per cells comes out to $3.26 with, let's just say, a 2 week lead time.

@Jinra did you incur import duties or anything else beyond the order cost?

if we get these through imr it'll be 15% more expensive per cell but will arrive in a week.  for perspective, for 50 cells you'd be paying an additional $7.50.

i did request a quote from the alibaba dealer, see what they come back with.

i'm not going to bother keeping track of who wants how many, i'll just get them in first then we can sort out who gets what.

$3.27 is a great price :) There were no additional fees for me. Keep in mind I believe this will count as a foreign transaction so you might want to make sure your card won't charge you international transaction fees.

doing a bit of organizing here, i wrote down names of everyone interested and quantities they're going after.

i'm going to markup the cells a little bit to cover financing costs, it'll be $3.50 a cell (that's still $0.75 less than buying retail and a 7% markup on my part).

if that makes you angry, we can internet fight about it here.

take a look and edit accordingly, please:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o9VimbNRdAweElitE4e-RGg3PKtuSSoyBC19Gvk1VJI/edit?usp=sharing

also got a quote for charge only bms from bestech, it's basically $20 plus fees and shipping so probably about $25 all in:

generally speaking, the two most popular brands are bestech and supower.

you can get a lower discharge bms on the cheap if you intend to bypass discharge and use it for charge only.

otherwise the bestech PCM-D223V1 is a popular choice:

so i asked nkon to see if i could add an additional 200 cells to the order of 600, but they've raised the prices since then and also quoted me a ridiculous shipping charge so...it's staying at 600 cells for now.

i did get a quote from a chinese supplier for $3 a cell, working on terms now.

i just may get more and hold on to them.

yea the best quote i got from a alibaba supplier was $3.4 a cell, about $0.25 more expensive than nkon.

but 30q prices seemed to have just gone up across the board so $3.4 a cell may be the new reality.

bringing this back from the dead.

IMR is having a sale right now.

with the sale, it's about $0.30 more than what we paid from nkon.  i'm going to order another batch of 600 since demand outstripped supply the first time around.

here are the prices:

green area is what you'd pay ordering directly from imr.  to the right is what you'd pay in this group buy.

awesome!

Just checking my math here, at ru.nkon.nl. €30 is the minimum shipping, and qty:127 is the highest quantity at which shipping is still €30.

127 x  €2.75 = €349.25
€30 shipping
€379.25 total, google converts this to $445.01usd, which is $3.50/cell. If you get charged say 3% currency conversion fee, that's $468.66 which is $3.69/cell.

At qty:40 it's like $4.10/cell.

Am I missing anything? Are there any other hidden fees or something? nkon is weeks shipping, and IMR is domestic?

nkon is so confusing.

EDIT max qty per order seems 301, shipping is €75 which is $3.52/cell.

I'm also wondering what @onloop is going to do for BF, he promised crazy prices on focbox and 10s4p 30q packs (no bms) on his facebook update videos...

sounds about right, at 127 cells, it's $3.50 a cell shipped.

when i ordered, the credit card i used didn't incur any foreign transaction fees.

also, no duties or anything else above the order amount.

so...yea i guess ordering from nkon would still be cheaper.

I've been annoyed at ru.nkon.nl shipping charge increments, so decided to nail it down.

€30 1 - 126 cells
€35 127 - 148 cells (21)
€40 149 - 170 cells (21)
€45 171 - 191 cells (20)
€50 192 - 212 cells (20)
(gave up here)

The initial €30 is $35.20, which is $.28/cell at 126 cells.

Increasing by €5 per 20 cells after 126 cells.

€5 is $5.87, that's $.29/cell at 20pc.

So it looks like shipping scales with number of cells linearly, in €5 steps, with €30 minimum.

even with imr, at bulk it's well below $4 which I'm pretty happy with.

Got mine from the first round. Thank you very much. 

Although, I must say, could've packed them better. I opened the box with it laying down and the cells just started pouring out.

if it happens, it's still a big if, it'd be a direct transaction. and after FOB it'll be more than whatever per cell cost is going to be.

so my quest to get cells direct from samsung as a wholesaler is, at the moment, not looking great.

they want a business license, moq is a pallet (30k cells), and fob stateside has to be handled personally.  haven't even got an actual quote yet.

readily available suppliers is still nkon, $3.55 a piece.

It seems like if you are buying at least 50, might as well just buy from Nkon as there comes to a point of diminishing returns on savings.

From Nkon ru with shipping to US:

50 cells= 167 euro= $198.14= $3.96/cell shipped


100 cells = 305 euro=$361.86=$3.62/cell shipped


200 cells= 600 euro=$711.59= $3.56/cell shipped


600 cells= 1795 euro=$2086.95=$3.48/cell shipped



So if you were to buy 50 at 3.80 = $190+9=$199= $3.98/cell shipped.



So basically, right now at least, if you are buying at least 50, might as well just buy direct from NKON ru?

Am I missing something or does this sound right?

For 120 cells it's like 3.57 shipped.  I can't find Any other distributer cheaper than almost $1 more per cell (Liion warehouse)... I don't mind paying a bit more,but $1/cell more seems steep.

 Planning on trying Nkon again after the holidays.

 A buddy if mine brought up... Ru Sanctions? Certainly not, right? I feel like I've seen a lot of you guys order some fairly recently. Probably just a personal problem 😓. Any thoughts/suggestions or fairly reasonable distributors would be appreciated.

as long as you order 50+ from nkon, per cell price should be about $3.5. 

if you get too many you may get an import duties bill. I got a bill for $40 for 600 cells, package was almost 70lbs. 

doesn't really make sense to do a group buy on these, just get em yourselves.

Not cheap but you could go IMR, it's like $89 shipped... better than 30 euro for shipping 16 batteries from NKON

Nkon really jumped up their prices for 30q recently. I'm always on the hunt for a good 30q deal maybe in the 500 ct range

Even now at 500ct nkon is charging about $3.75 shipped

IMR is at about $4 shipped

Liion wholesale is about $5 shipped

hey, sorry everyone, i'm gonna have to cancel this buy for the time being.

gf had to remind me we're moving in two weeks and can't complicate things further by taking on 200lbs worth of batteries during the move.

if anyone would like to take this over, let me know.  i will forward you my contact (it's just a alibaba seller that i've been buttering up for the last few months).

sorry to get everyone all riled up.

Does anyone know exactly how much each cell is and minimum order if we are buying directly from manufactures? There don't seem to be any obvious link on the internet on how to get them without any third-party suppliers. Doesn't it make more sense if the manufactures sold it directly over the counter or in their own website? :thinking:

You can't buy directly from the manufacturer. If you did, you need to be a registered business. It's not in the interest of big manufacturers like Samsung SDI and LG  to sell cells directly to consumers. Do you have deep pockets to facilitate the transaction of 20,000 cells?

That's why we are in a group buy topic :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
So you need to be a business to get these cells I see. Jehu did a pellet group buy once and sold LG HB2 cells for only $1 each. Made me wondering how much these cells really are worth. But he bought it from another person.

Even then you are acquiring cells from the middlemen and not the manufacturer for a group buy. There is a special agreement to buy a set amount for several years as stated in a contract for the big players like Tesla and Panasonic. It's not feasible to any of us here in the community to do a group buy on that scale.

It's more expensive for them to deal with customers directly as is for any business. Imagine the amounts of people more that they would have to employ etc. It's a lot easier to deal in 10,000s even if you charge 50% less, they're making it up by not having to have a direct sales dept. or customer service dept. or small shipments dept. plus all of the logistics associated with selling dangerous goods directly to customers

Well, it would be really cool if someone came forward and offered cells at even more 'decent' price.

Looking at prices it doesnt seem like 'old models' get price reduction at all, at least not seeing anything interesting price wise on Nkon website for Eu buyers.

I wish there were more options price wise, at least something similar in price to what you can get on Nkon international website, it almost seems like there are more costs besides VAT, which they add for selling inside of EU :confused:
