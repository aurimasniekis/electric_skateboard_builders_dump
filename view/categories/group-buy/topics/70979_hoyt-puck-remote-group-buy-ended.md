Alright Ladies and Gentlemen!

Here is the official Group Buy on those super sexy Hoyt remotes.

I got one of these right away when they first came out as I haven't been satisfied with any of the common thumb controlled remotes on the market, and boy I am glad I did!

Right away you notice that this isn't a generic rebranded product.  It is made from CNC'd Bamboo and has a circular array of LED indicator lights. Everything feels great in the hand. The thumb wheel  is a piece of aluminium instead of dinky plastic and has little to no slop and a good amount of throw for people on more powerful builds to better control speed. 

The remote has 3 different speed modes.  You need to do the PPM settings in the third (fastest) mode and the other modes will fall into place accordingly.  Also a nice touch is that changing between modes gives a distinct vibration so that it is easier to tell what mode you are in while riding in louder city conditions (versus just some quiet beeps).

The remote is also easy to switch the throttle direction for any of you lefties out there. 

As far as connectivity, it has been great.  The range is insane and I have experienced 0 dropouts even in high traffic areas that have given most other remotes issues.

Some people have asked why this remote is so pricey, I honestly thought the same thing at first.... until I used it.

I would say this is the first truly premium remote and I encourage you guys to give it a go. 


***CUSTOM ENGRAVING OPTION***

As you can see on my remote, Hoyt engraved it with my avatar name, SENDER.  This might not be a big deal to many, but i think it is awesome.  There is no limit in characters (within reason) the font will just be smaller if you go for more.

Just imagine, nicknames, build names, personal mantras, or hell, maybe even the lyrics to your favorite Nickelback song.  

I am going with my next build thread name, but that's just me.  Personalized engraving will be a $15 fee.  Monies well spent.


So here is how this is going down unless something changes:

The price on these is $189 on the Hoyt site right now.  

Here for the group buy, they are giving them to us for **$149 shipped** within the US.

DISCOUNT CODE (without engraving):

**PUCKWITHOUTENGRAVING**


(+ $15 for custom engraving, how can you not?!?).

DISCOUNT CODE (with engraving):

**PUCKWITHENGRAVING**

In order to let them know what you want engraved on your remote send an email to hoytskate@hoytskate.com with PUCK REMOTE ENGRAVING in the subject and tell them your order # and what you want!

As far as international interest, they are holding off for now, but PM me and I can see what I can do.

BTW, I am not affiliated with Hoyt;  they just have some awesome products and I wanted more people to be able to get in on this!


**TL;DR:**  Too bad.

Its cool for one thing.  But the can be turned on and off.  There is also a "lock mode" that turns them blue.  And if there is any connection issue or the board is off they are red.  It is also the charge indicator lights as well.

how does the remote feel in your hand when at full throttle and full brake. Do you have to adjust or strain your hand to reach full pulse width with a puck? Or does your thumb smoothly and comfortably transition the length of the throttle ?

It also depends on the engraving right? Like having ‚Äúskatan‚Äù would increase performance tenfold but you‚Äôd need to consult @longhairedboy for performing the associated rituals i think

With not-need-but-want, go for things that are limited runs first, then things that are on sale. This carries over to most other hobbies too.

I got the few parts for my boards upgrade coming tomorrow, Including dual 200KV 6374's. However I'm not gonna bother cracking my board open till this comes in. Kinda stoked to ditch the nano x. @sender I recently found out the nano x goes full brake when it dies. What does the puck do?

Just set up my first Hoyt remote (pre group buy). Binding was simple, just follow the steps In the video. 

The ergonomics take some getting used to...I have mostly nano 2, nano, nano x remotes...but after 10 minutes or so, it felt natural. 

The throttle wheel is far more linear than any other remote I‚Äôve used. Very quickly I felt comfortable with the down hill braking to hard throttle transitions, which can be tricky on a new remote. 

I expected the mode to be difficult to locate while keeping my eyes on the road, but i was wrong, it‚Äôs right where you want it to be and the vibration pulses make switching modes a no look process. 

Fit and finish is also far better than any other remote I‚Äôve used. It feels solid, no rattling, no big gaps between seams. It almost looks like a high end portable speaker.

If I‚Äôm nitpicking, I wish the lanyard was located in different spot. Coming out of the back means I run the lanyard through my fingers, which is a minor annoyance. I may get used to it and if not, I‚Äôll just cut it off.

In summary, this remote looks, feels, and functions like a high end device. It‚Äôs the most expensive remote I‚Äôve ever bought, but so far it feels like money well spent.

Yeah, but they are not going to do any more international orders right now.  I just found out last night. Later I will tag all the people with international interest to let them know.

If they know some one in the states, they could buy it for them and ship it to them.

I know enough UD people, but I want what I buy on my name in case of waranty.

I also work at a postal hub so I should get a pretty good price on shipping with my discount.

The remote and board are awesome They really went above and beyond with the design of the board. I was lucky enough to get in  contact with Jeff one of the partner of Hoyt who happened to be coming to NYC for a few day. And set up demo for NYC Eboarding. Got to try out the board and was able to get my remote  personally hand-deliver told me. Well have the board for one more day to ride. ![image|690x459](upload://wRY3qizeaVIe6a4x0f6WAiWx79x.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://jSk9u8j7gy6namOdY5v4wcrtrJg.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://mHYdzQJn7ducaucgAbIiGX9FAtM.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://xh8lExWc6aJz3v0MdqfKB6TkOoG.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://bDviYm62R71bvyW4u7F6W8HDQtX.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://4rGsUCrdonytiV8aSId2m4JnDPw.jpeg)

I really like what Hoyt has done....not just another electric skateboard but rather a well thought out piece of engineering and design. Hoyt encompasses form and function with great design notes. This is the type of company that is pushing Esk8 forward. I am very interested in seeing what they come up with next.

Maybe rethink the whole all terrain / mountain board approch.

Great job Hoyt Team!!!

So I got my puck today. Haven't installed it as i'm at work. It seems solid. The throttle wheel is smooth. Not as much a throw as I thought it would be but i think it has definitely has more than the nano x. I noticed something and I'm wondering if its supposed to be like this but my T button rattles/moves around a bit. The others are solid and don't move.

Ok, so besides the annoying rattling the T button makes, this remote is pretty sweet. I directly compared the distance you can push this remote to my nano x and it honestly feels about the same distance, you can push maybe a tiny bit more. The remote seems so smooth, like seriously its night and day when applying the throttle. It feels more responsive. I extensively tested this on my board up and down the hallway in my apartment and it's just plain awesome. I haven't messed with anything else on the remote, i just set it up in vesc tools and off I went. It's raining outside (go figure) so tomorrow I'll get to test it out more.

Oh and I don't have to do that annoying ass calibration any more. Huge plus there.

Just went for a coffee run this morning, Got to say it does feel like it has a lot of travel. It's so smooth. I got to give it time to get used to as I when I turn the remote on I try and do calibration and the board almost took off across the street. The other thing is the wrist strap location, I wish it was on the bottom as someone else mentioned. I wear bulky gloves because I like the skin to stay on my hands and I have to run the strap between my fingers which is weird but not horrible.

It‚Äôs a cool design don‚Äôt get me wrong. But just seems a bit overpriced for what it is. The lights could be used for more info, no display, and it didn‚Äôt feel significantly different when I checked it out in Vegas. The wheel has that same spring feeling as my $20 mini remote. Just too high of a price for what it is imo. It‚Äôs maybe slightly better for 8 times the price.

I was on hiatus. I‚Äôm stepping back into the game again with a new build and working on getting six shooters on to hummie hubs, but still leaving my company on hiatus.

I didn‚Äôt have a chance to use the remote on the street, I just held it in my hand and pulled he throttle back and forth. Again, not trying to hate on it or anything. Just the $20 mini remote has good range, it‚Äôs smooth the whole way and never drops out. It also just works out of the box with no setting adjustments. The only thing this has over the mini is its a better form factor (and it‚Äôs a thumb throttle if that‚Äôs your thing of course, but it‚Äôs not for me). I didn‚Äôt feel any premium spring to it. We were actually talking about how cheap the spring still felt to what we were expecting

I see what your saying about cheap. That is definantly true about the mini remote. It feels cheap. I guess the overall grip of this remote does feel solid. But it‚Äôs pretty easy to reskin the mini remote into a puck like this. I just personally wouldn‚Äôt spend so much on a remote. It‚Äôs sorta like the vesc 6 imo. The official one feels and looks super legit compared to say a focbox with its plastic. But one is half the price of the other and they both provide the same function.

Hence why you don‚Äôt have an accurate representation as to the feel and quality of the remote - riding it is where it really matters and where it really performs.

Just tested out the puck for the first time after getting rid of my nano x and the difference really is night and day. I also upgraded to ackmaniac software at the same time, so that‚Äôs definitely part of the reason my board is buttery smooth now. I love how I can actually release the throttle from any position and the board just coasts, unlike the nano x which would jerk me forward pretty aggressively. Definitely gonna grab another one of these for the subsonic spirit I‚Äôm planning. ![image|375x500](upload://8HklrbBvSzt44XuliZLRif1WJqX.jpeg)

You can let it ship to a shipito warehouse and from there to you.
Just make sure it‚Äôs not in the prohibited items for import to your country.
You can check that on the shipito side too.

Not only is that one of the purposes of the Forum, but how reviews works. Not everyone has the disposable income to impulsive buy things and test them out. Especially on a product that's $150+ and can be deadly if it fails it certain situations. 

@Socalscare is doing the smart & responsible thing for a product that's only been out for less than a year much less six months. 

As a matter of fact there is a potential problem with the hoyt remote (more so receiver) that Hoyt knows about:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/a9ik2f/month_old_hoyt_board_no_longer_connects_to_deck/

Response to user form hoyt in the edit of the post for the lazy:

> Hoyt responded and said they recently found out that the board stops connecting to the remote when it gets cold. So they acknowledge and know about the issue

But this can be isolated to a select few receivers. 

Note: That this is not for the interest of damaging hoy's sales as I own two receivers and a remote myself.

That's terrible advice. Listen forum readers, if you're not up for the task of potentially repairing manufacturing issues shit yourself , dont be a beta tester: wait. See if it has any kinks (there always will be) and wait to see if the kinks are worth dealing with and learning from. Research your product, research your vendor, and make education and financial decisions that best fit your income and abilities.

This being my first build and one that will be my daily transportation is the reason I didn't jump on the group buy. I don't have enough knowledge or experience to be a beta tester on a product that could potentially leave me stranded or worse...  Yes I could have easily purchased one on the GB and saved a bit of $$$ but I was not comfortable doing so. I'm sorry that you think it's BS for people not to jump in feet first but I would like this to be a positive experience for my first try and not end up getting pissed because of an untested part. As I get a bit more experience with it I will definitely be willing to jump on beta testing products for a discount, at that point I will know what to expect and can give a good review of it.

This has happened to all my remotes minus the GT2B. All of my Nano-X's don't pair if my boards have been sitting in the cold. I've been known to take a hair dryer to my enclosure where my receiver is located for a few minutes. Works like a charm. Once its paired, it's good to go. I think this has something to do with the crystal freezing or something.

From a personal point of view the remote should be the highest quality component on the entire build and priced to suit.  We put up with cheap solutions and cry if they are over 100 bucks.  I do not understand this reasoning.  In every other form of rc and this can be described as rc, (cue @b264)  a decent remote costs a lot of money.  My futaba cost over 400 and for a unit that does not cut out and has decent range thats the accepted cost.  A lost connection means a lost race.  A lost connection while hurtling down the street on a plank of wood at 40mph can have far more devastating consequences.  I for one would pay any amount to have that peace of mind.

anyone ran into an issue where it goes full throttle no problem in mode one but goes full throttle in mode 2 and 3 and then just stops after a few seconds? I'm using the focbox unity with remote calibrated. Tested on bench. No fault codes. 

This was tested on the default throttle curve and -100% and 100% Polynomial Throttle Curve

my guess is you did the remote calibration in mode 1 (beginner mode i assume)
the other 2 modes have a greater pulse width, thus when you go full throttle, the ppm overshoots and the vesc thinks it's an error.

redo your pulse width min-max in while in the other modes, or find the mode that has the greatest pulse width range

The remote has 3 different speed modes. You need to do the PPM settings in the third (fastest) mode and the other modes will fall into place accordingly.
