@goldenHusky just released some great looking (and performing, i'm sure) anti-spark switches, take a look here:

http://www.antisparkheaven.com/product/directfet-antispark-switch-with-6-mosfets

as they're priced now, it would be over $100usd shipped individually.  i'm in touch with goldenHusky about a group buy right now, looks like 10% off, so 54eur, or 64usd before shipping.

we can order these switches with wires attached and shrink wrapped, that would make it 58eur, or 69usd before shipped.

you will then have to source your own SPDT LED switch to power it on / off.

or...we can source the very basic switch from goldenHusky, then i can source everything else and install them.  probably cost another $10 to attach wires, shrink wrap, and the SPDT LED switch.  all said, this would probably be approaching $85 per switch shipped within the US.

so, let's have a poll with the options and see what's what:

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=1 public=true]
* $64 option, without shipping - very basic switch, each person installs wires / wraps / on-off switch
* $69 option, without shipping - get switch with wires and wrapped, each person installs on-off switch
* $85 option, shipping included - very basic switch, then @thisguyhere installs wires / wraps / on-off switch
* individual option - each person buys direct from @goldenHusky
[/poll]

these are all preliminary, rounded numbers.  i'll tighten these figures later on, but it shouldn't deviate too much either.

Los angeles, for you it'd make more sense to buy direct, I'm trying to minize eu to usa shipping costs.
