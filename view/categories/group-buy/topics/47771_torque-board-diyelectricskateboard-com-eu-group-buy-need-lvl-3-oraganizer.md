Hi Everyone.

I was going to buy some of the 218mm trucks but saw how expensive it was for shipping and such to EU

So i though we could make a group buy of items from  that is no larger than trucks with wheels on.

I however live in Denmark, one of the countries in EU with highest tax. So i was wondering if someone from a EU contry with low tax would receive?

Per forum guidelines, you have to be trust level 3 (regular) to organize a group buy.

Group buys also need to be posted in the group buy category.

@Youssless is in EU. Would be a good candidate for "receiving" if he's upto it as he's also lvl3 and could facilitate this.

That's a shame, as I'd still trust him, as he organized a TSG pass group buy and the secret santa for 2017.. but I'm not one to bend the rules.

If you can find someone who is level 3 who is interested. They will need to open a new thread in group buy category and organize the whole thing

I've updated your thread title. If no one responds regarding lvl 3 I'm sure this will be closed. But at least change your body content to include your looking for a lvl 3 member. As I did for your topic title..

25% is roughly the same as in denmark. So maybe i will get back to you if someone from a less tax burdend contry does not sign up

Lucky but dumb American here. Can one of you enlighten me in this tax issue you have in the EU? How does that work? Does customs hold your packages ransom? who bills you the 25% and how do THEY determine the value of an item?

The problem is that we have to pay import tax and duty, which is very expensive. In denmark we pay 25% tax and then another 12% if the value on the product is over a certain threshold.  But then we also pay 160Danish kr just to let the post firm handle and calculate the taxes.

When the the package arrives in the airport, its custom checked, if it need to be payed then its hold onto into payment is done. In Denmark we have 1 central postal service "post Danmark" they handle all letters and many packages. DHL, UPS, TNT and so on are also pressent but they are running their own game.

They determine the value by opening the box or checking the confirmation declared value.

We appreciate you wanting to help but a Level 3 will have to organize the buy, taking and fulfilling orders.

With all due respect (and a little offtopic). I understand the guidelines and all. But this LVL 3 and how to keep it sure feels unrealistic. I also once was regular. I'm trying to exaggerate all the requirements and I still haven't got it back. I can promise you I try and read everything unread on a daily (max 2 day) basis. Liking, replying when and where I can and (most importantly) When I feel it's a real contribution to the topic.

To make or like x posts where half of them is baked air just doesn't make sense to me. But hey, you get a badge (and therefor a right to make group buys)!

Its pretty crazy I paid 30 eu customs on my gt2b, and something like 80 for hubmotors marked as 225 bucks worth or something.
I cannot stress enough that it really does feel like daylight robbery and the worst part is that they expect you to basically lick their asses or believe they walk on water because of their ridiculous uniform. 
Of course, it's essentially kidnapping your stuff and worst of all, your stuff comes late because of it.
Also everything is left up to the guy's discretion so they can decide that you have to pay more because of... "reasons".
I get the point of taxation, but the way it is implemented is tantamount to a ransom.
Also, just putting it out there: a customs tax is stupid. Like, just, stupid. Like throwing sand in a gearbox. For us regular people at least.
TL, DR : EU customs suck. You dont wanna deal with them. They're not really criminal, but they still suck. A lot.

I feel you. I've imported quite some stuff. Trying to find a percentage that makes sence for all the payments I've done. It's like they have a random fee generator. I can assure you they don't have a clue. In two cases the amount I've paid exceeded the package value. That's when it became real robbery

Edit: What works for me is thinking about the fact that at least i'm not in Switzerland

Back on the bandwagon I go.

Thanks for opening my eyes to this :blush:

The system keeps stats on your activities in the forum.
There are set requirements for Level 3 and if your stats fall below the requirements, the system automatically bumps you down.
It happened to me once before and I didn't understand why either at the time.
