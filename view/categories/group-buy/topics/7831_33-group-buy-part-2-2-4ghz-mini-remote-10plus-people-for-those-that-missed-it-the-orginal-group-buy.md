@Michaelinvegas I might want one to mess with. I've tested it out using the steering for thumb throttle. I have big hands so it's comfortable that way and I'm a lefty so it's perfect. I'm going to give it to a buddy of mine and see if he can make the trigger a deadman switch for me then fab the wheel a bit to make it look and feel better. 
My question is would you be able to ship it with my enertion stuff when it comes in. Can you hold onto either/or until you have it all?

Thanks eh!

** edit ** gotta watch the spring back if you let go to quickly it will tap the brake on you. Just wanted to add that incase someone try's it.

Wow how'd you do the steering wheel as throttle? Easy?  Lefty too. Finally we get a break.

 @Hummie Just use channel one. Note the edit above too.

It would be cool if someone could print something to fit instead of the wheel. I have nothing but dremels and hacksaws :slight_smile:

Yep, you can get them fairly cheap but it's usually not worth because of importation and such. Will generally end up costing similar prices.

I haven't put this on a single group buy prior. Why does it matter to you. You don't have to buy it. This forum is meant to share information.

I'm not even the one selling it. It's not like I'm making money off it.

I've been playing with the Winning remote so I'm not sure.

Ok looks like we keep ramping up the group buy....

So let me throw this in the MIX to hopefull add a few more orders ....For fun!


For those who have lights and or would like to add lights in the future....

I will add this

This will turn on and off your lights...8 fun-tastic lighting effects and dimmer.... For 12v light systems 

Just use 3m to attach it to the bottom of your remote to act as a base...and it become part of your remote 

GOOD LUCK .... One random person will get it in thier box
