**UPDATED POST:** https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-group-buy-tb218-trucks-85-8-75-7-shipped-new-price-planning-15-15/83364/133?u=legend27

-----

Hi everyone!

First, I'm located in **Europe (Denmark)**

It's quite some time since last group buy for TB218 trucks. And since I need a pair for a future build, someone else might also.

I'm currently looking for people that would be interested in being a part of a EU group buy for TB218 trucks. Just post a comment :slight_smile: 

We need to order at least **15 sets** before getting them at that price mentioned below.

**GROUP BUY STATUS: 15/15 SETS**
PAYMENTS RECEIVED: 15/15
-

IN CASE YOU WANT TO JOIN THE GROUP BUY, IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET IN QUE:
Current que:
1. @Goldenic
2. @Acido
3. @Balta_6
4. @Marsl187 

-----
**THE PRICE (FINAL)**
-


**Basic:**
- 15x Trucks = 15*$50 = **$750**
- Shipping (TB to ME) = **$150**

**Import:**
Declared item value will be $15*25 = **$225**
- Tax (2,7% of items value+shipping) = ($225+$150)*0,027= **$10,125**
- Vat (25% of items value+shipping+tax = ($225+$150+$10,125)*0,25= **$96,28**
- Handling items (Post company) = **$25**

**TOTAL: $1031,405**
-

Divide $1031,405 by 15 and each set of trucks will cost: **$68,8**
Add $17 (ish) for shipping from ME to YOU:

$85,8/€75,7 per. set incl. shipping
-

Yes, that's "only" $20/€17 less than ordering directly from TB incl. shipping **but that's without taxes**. After taxes has been paid the total cost for the trucks would be **$159/€137** (at least for me) so you would save around **$74/€65** by entering this group buy.

----
Thanks for reading all the way to the end!

Thanks! I do know they exist though. Only issue is that you can only fit dual 6355 with those trucks using the Nano Gear Drive from 3DServisas. With TB218 you can fit dual 6374.

Shipping (TB to ME) = **$180** (ish)

Um anit there a freeshipping code above 300$ and theres a 5% coupon (dont want to post it)

![freeship2|492x492](upload://qqd7SUDRbavEJff1iYcS51QskmG.png) ![freeship1|510x482](upload://jInvuqIFMBpfAqrtdrZmq39si19.png)

Tax= 25.01$
Vat= 281.82$
Shipping Company= 25$

**TOTAL: $1258.08**

Total per set =  **_100.87$_** **_(so 88.75 Euro shipped per set)_**

Damn that price really trickles down to the consumer, and my 7th grade math actually worked

That was honestly somewhere around the price I was hoping we could get them at. It's just not that much of a reality right now. I still have a few concerns though.

Im not sure if free shipping would still count for a 20kg package :grin: But if it did, we probably wouldn't be able to get any other crazy discounts. I'm also pretty sure it isn't possible to apply two discount codes at the same time. Then it should be a group buy discount.
I also think for some stupid reason that the vat and tax we would have to pay, would have some shipping price included.

Will try to contact TB within the next few days (probably today) to get more accurate on the pricing. Will update later...

**Btw. would anyone be interested in buying a set if we could get the price lower than €104,2? If so at what price?**

Just a heads up. TB hangers can accommodate dual/quad 6380 motors as well with the addition of about 8-12mm of spacers between each wheel and the axel :wink:

I did the codes one at a time and still got those prices 😀

Using the 5% code would get you cheaper prices than the free shipping code

You calculated it like this, right?

**$926,25**(trucks)+**$281,82**(vat)+**$25,01**(tax)+**$25**(shipping company)+**$0**(shipping)=**$1258,08**

You won't be able to have two discounts activated at the same time when checking out. It's either free shipping or 5% off.

The thing is it dosen't cost $40 to ship 20kg from USA to Europe (Denmark). More like $180

We need to order at least **15 sets** to get that price.

Raw them yourself its easy.  Wire brush on a drill or grinder.  The black coating comes off.  Cool if you leave the recessed torqueboards logo black too.  It leaves a nice swirl effect on the alloy too.  Did some for a friends build but no pics sorry.  Took a while but looked very cool.  Been thinking about doing the rest of mine.

[/quote]

I think they are powder coated so it would have to be a strong stripper and I have had some staining occur on other raw jobs using nasty paint stripper.  Still nothing that a light sanding afterwards doesn't clean up.  Then a spirit wash and some clear laquer.  I left the baseplates black too.  Mostly because I was fed up doing it but it looked awesome.

If they are willing to help you can lower way more. This truck (similar ones) can be bought for 10$ per truck so if they do it just decrease it significantly to be worth it. Just my opinion.

Will ask. It's probably not first time they get asked so they might have some experience.
Only issue might be that customs will most likely open the package to look inside... then we also need a fake receipt or no receipt...

of course it won't be the first time they have been asked about. The only issue would be if they are not willing to do it. For the rest don't worry. They don't have to add any paper inside the box. As I said this truck you find almost identical one for 5$ so as long they declare less you are gonna be fine. Of course do what makes you feel better, my was just a suggestion to make the it more appealing and so reach the threshold of 15 sets.

Will you include motormounts too? As they are slightly different too, might be easy to be able to add a set of mounting rings.

Hi everyone! Time for an update.

So I have now been in contact with TB about the suggestion to lower the declared value. Thanks @rey8801!

They can declare the value as low as $35, but that would probably cause the post company to contact me and ask for a receipt... 

**$15** per set actually seems quite legit, if you ask me. That means the total declared value will be **$225**. Just need Dexter to confirm that it seems legit and it will be the price :+1: 

With lower declared value that of course also means lower prices for us! The final cost of the trucks will now be **$85,8/€75,7** shipped. That's $10 less :+1:

![trucks|690x164](upload://loAaEWR2DZxfrfts01kJlMovZ2x.png) 
 

@Gerrycorrado Alex from TB said it would be possible to add two motor mounts :slight_smile:

I talked to Dexter about, if the new pneumatics will have a group buy price. He didn't know yet. Not sure if the 110mm will have a group buy price.

It might be possible to include the 110mm in the group buy, but it will depend on when they will be available, change shipping cost, group buy price and demand. If we get to 15 sets before they get released, i'm pretty sure it has to be another group buy.

I will explain final prices incl. shipping for each country, rules, return, details, etc. when we reach 15 sets. That will also be the last chance to leave the group buy in case you change your mind.

I expect to place the order when we have reached 15 sets and everyone has paid :slight_smile:

Shipping would cost each of you $7,2. Total price for the trucks would be $76=€67,5 incl. shipping.

While everyone is here, I might just give a quick update.

I've been trying to get some discount on shipping, but no companies wants to give us any. Only if we sent at least 3000 packages a year :stuck_out_tongue:
And when I do actually find someone with really cheap shipping, they only ship for companies...

Shipping might come out a bit more expensive than $17 **FOR SOME COUNTRIES** (such as Croatia), so we have two options.

1. Total shipping cost will be split everyone so everyone will pay the same amount for the trucks incl. shipping. That's a minus for those who got cheap shipping, but a way to make sure everyone (hopefully) still wants to be a part of the group buy.

2. You pay your own shipping. Price may vary a lot so you might have to pay quite a bit more than expected. Maybe you have to pay less. Downside is that it might be too expensive for someone and they decide to quit the group buy.

Option 1 will most likely only be chosen if everyone votes on that.

Go ahead and vote :slight_smile:

I totally understand your point but I would say maybe is better that you first prepare an excel file with the trucks price plus the shipping cost  and then we can judge how much we are talking about. I want that everyone take part of it but if for few we all have to pay way more I think you miss the GB main aim. I would say, if possible let's see the difference first :grin:

With truck price I meant only the total split it. No needs to show all your calculation. It's just to taste the GB offer and people can judge if it is worth it add the shiipong cost. Anyhow appreciate the transparency and thank you a lot for doing it. I did a GB few months ago and it's a lot of additional work to do. Plus packaging ecc... I would say at the end would be nice if everyone add like 5 Euro for the effort you are putting in.

Aiming to post an update tomorrow with all final the information.

@pjotr47 Pretty sure PostNord is DPD in Denmark. They got some kind of partner ship going on. Still expensive though.

@Sedmii
@XplorerBE
@mackann

I talked to Dexter and unfortunatly is the limit 15 sets for the current price. Otherwise shipping will get more expensive and be too much of a PITA for the very kind DIYElectricSkateboard team.

That means we have to limit 1 set of trucks per person. I have tagged those who "ordered" two sets. When lowering them to 1 set, is the magical amount of trucks 15 sets. 

Im sorry, but there is not much to do.

Good news is that I also managed to get us a little gift. They might be a bit sticky :stuck_out_tongue: 

Calculations expected to be posted tomorrow.

Just that you know, if you are going to use PayPal then make sure your account has been validated over the time otherwise when PayPal sees a lot of cash coming in a short time it will hold it on and you can not use it until you prove that you ship the things out. Of course if we pay with friends and family there is no problem. I am fine with paying without good and service. Just that you know beforehand.

**Hey everyone!**
-
I've now finally got all the numbers and information together. All you need to do is sent me the money (explained below) and I'll take care of the rest.

Here is how things are gonna go:

---
Description:
- 
**Item**: TorqueBoards 218mm trucks
Details and photos can be found [here](https:///collections/featured-items/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks)

----
Time frame:
-
The time frame is quite hard to calculate in days, but here is step-by-step on what's going to happen:
1. I have received all the money
2. I place the order
3. Trucks gets shipped
4. Items reach customs
5. Customs get paid
6. I buy supplies (boxes, tape, bubble wrap, etc.)
7. I receive the trucks
8. I pack the trucks
9. I buy shipping labels
10. I go to my local library to print shipping labels
11. Ship the trucks to you
12. You receive the trucks

----
Rules:
-
You got until the 15/02-2019 23:59 CET to either:
- Pay all of the money
- Give me the message, that you don't want to participate in the group buy anymore.

After the 15/02-2019 23:59 CET is there only one way to leave the group buy.
You have to message me that you want to leave the group buy, and then I'll contact the first person in the que. If he/she does not want to participate in the group buy anymore and there is no one else in the que, will it be **your** job to find someone else **before the 15/02-2019 23:59 CET.**

In case you do not find anyone and you insist on not paying the amount, will it be possible for one of the other participants to get 2 sets.

In case you do find someone, will I be sending your money back. I will be taking care of the rest.
**I do not guarantee that you will be receiving all of your money again, as there MIGHT be a really small fee from paypal.**

Other useful informations:
- There won't be any warranty on the trucks with exceptions decided by me.
- It won't be possible to return the trucks after you receive them.
- You will have to pay the full amount upfront.

---
**Payment:**
-

![usernamee|690x165](upload://zAE5ywGYdU4JnzJSe7FlcjUyYO2.png) 

**It's only possible to pay with Paypal.** You can either choose F&F (link below) or G&S. For G&S do you have to DM me, then I'll send you my email :slight_smile: Please note that is it a bit more expensive to pay with G&S. Price can be found next to F&F price.

**In case you want untracked shipping, sent me a DM and I'll give you the total price.** 

In the message box, please put your:
- Forum username
- Address
- E-mail
- Phone number
- Tracked or untracked shipping
- F&F or G&S

Please don't check the box that says some like "Im buying a product or service". You will have to pay the remaining money afterwards.

Belgium "group buy":

@pjotr47
@XplorerBE
@Gerrycorrado

![belgium|204x111](upload://qWSB6fEYqEoxyX6Uj5iHztAIb5m.png) 

This section is only relevant for those who have been tagged.

**The amount above is what you have to pay me.**

I will be shipping the trucks to one of you. That person needs to buy shipping, boxes and tape. The trucks will be wrapped in bubble wrap, so no need for that.

All of the items will be shipped in one box, so that person who receives the trucks, need to find 3 boxes for ship the other trucks.

I am not responsible for how much each of you will have to pay that person for boxes, shipping, tape, etc.

**When shipping the trucks, each box should contain:**
2x truck hangers
2x base plates
2x set of bushings
1x gift

**Hey everyone!**
Don't know where to start.

First, thanks to all of you that payed a bit more than you really should. That has had a HUGE impact on this group buy and the following update! 

So, first I thought I had fucked up. Then I realized I hadn't and I got saved by the $4 for unexpected + those who were kind enough to send a bit extra :pray:
So PayPal gives me 7,22 DKK per. euro. That equals to €1104,8 x 7,22 DKK = 7976,66 DKK in total. What I expected to have was €1104,46 x 7,46 DKK = 8241,808 DKK. Thats a 265 DKK loss because of PayPal's shitty exchange rate.
And for some reason, I can only transfer DKK to my bank account. Not euro. That means I'll have to stick to the shitty exchange rate.

**So lesson learned. ALWAYS when using paypal, make people pay in your currency. Otherwise you will lose a lot on the exchange..**

I have been thinking about lowering the import value to $180 because of the shitty exchange rate.
Then the total would be 8091,33 DKK for the whole group buy.

So next challenge. I forgot to add my middle name on my paypal account, so I will have to get that fixed. And of course, I need to upload a lot of verification...
The reason I need that middle name is to get the money transferred from PayPal to my bank account. Might run into some issues if the names does not match 100%.


Think that was it.

**I'm really sorry for the delay, but hope to get it fixed very soon.**'

As usual, if you got any questions, feel free to contact me :slight_smile:

btw. @Mich21050 im missing your address

I'm glad you're asking :slight_smile:

Well since paypal also got shitty exchange rates from euro to usd would the price be slightly higher.
Here is the explanation:
1 EUR = 1 USD (Paypal): **$1,09**
1 EUR = 1 USD (Bank): **$1,12**

900 USD = xxx EUR (Paypal): **$900/$1,09 = €825.69**
900 USD = xxx EUR (Bank): **$900/$1,12 = €803.57**

 UPDAAAATE!!!
-

I've been in touch with Paypal and they have confirmed that my middle name has been added. For an unknown reason does it not show my middle name on my profile, but that's a whole other thing...

------
I've requested to get €1 transferred to my bank account and if that goes well, I'll transfer the remaining.

I know it would have been a lot faster and easier to transfer all of them at once, but since I recently just added my bank account details again and i'm not sure about the middle name, do I wanna be on the safe side. Would be a tragedy to loose €1000 of your money...

---
If everything goes as planned and the money is in my bank account really soon, am I expecting to have the order placed no later than friday.

BUT in case someone decides to leave the group buy, you can take their spot. I'll put you in the que (number 1) and contact you if it happens :slight_smile: 

I've actually seen quite a few people sell those trucks used and new on the forum, so you might be lucky to find some in the EU.

UPDATE
-

All of the money finally reached my bank account.

but

TorqueBoards does not have enough in stock for the group buy...

Not the update I expected and probably either not you.

They will be in stock again in about a month and that's pretty much our only option.

BUT
-
The truck axels will be 40-50% stronger!!!!

----
I guess now is the time where it will be possible to leave the group buy (same circumstances as mentioned in the "group buy rules" post).

I'm really sorry for the long delay, but there is not really much to do. I'm sorry...

Okay. I did the calculations.

Please send me 570DKK (595DKK for G&S) via the link below. I recommend to select "Card issuer" as who determines the currency value, as it will be a bit cheaper (at least in Denmark it is).


In the message box please write your:

* Forum username
* Address
* E-mail
* Phone number

Payment link:
Paypal.me/Frederik11 (Please select "DKK" as the currency)

Thanks for participating!

In case you're wondering. 570DKK is equal to 570DKK/€7,46=€76,4

Perfect it has the same pivot size of Paris truck. So I already mdoelwd like that. Thanks for the info. BTW I am making another direct drive. First one MAD Fury kit coversion (look in the forum), now I will make it one from scratch, way overpowered :smile: it will go with the custom deck I am making (BullyDeck) 

A little insight of the 3d printed test fit comparison with the one I have just made it which is already really strong.

**UPDATE**
-

@L3chef 

I talked to Dexter today and he finally had an update!

- The trucks should be finished in production on the 6th of April.
- Then they should arrive at TorqueBoards on the 10th to the 12th of April.
- Then shipped out on the 13th of April.
- Arrive to me on the 18th to the 23th of April.
- I would ship them on the 24th to 25th of April.
- Shipping from me to you would be somewhere around a week I guess.

This is only an estimation, so it can potentially be within much shorter time or a bit longer.

I know it's much longer time than mentioned in the last update where it was a month from there, but there is not really much to do...

Just talked to TB :slight_smile:

The trucks have been manufactured and just need to be assembled. They should be assembled and shipped to TB by next week or so :slight_smile:

Dexter also give us the opportunity, to get the old ones instead. They would probably be shipped to me this week.
                             
So I guess it really depends on whether you need the trucks now or for a future build.
**Also, remember the truck axels will be 40-50% stronger on the new ones!**


Should we get the old ones instead of the new ones?

To cover orders in the meantime they get the new version. Otherwise you want to buy motor, motor mount and trucks and the trucks are how of stock. They loose more Because the customer won't buy it anymore.
If they want to give us the old one fine, but half of the price. They will have left over anyway. @legend27 you should ask that :wink: it's a win win for both

Anyway, he will give me a shout back later, maybe today, with current tracking status.

Hopefully everyone will have their sets before the session starts...

Quick tracking update:

1. @Goldenic
2. @Acido
3. @Balta_6

If you are interested in buying the pair, send me a PM :slight_smile:
