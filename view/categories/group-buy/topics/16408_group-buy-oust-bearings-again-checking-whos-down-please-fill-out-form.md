The Only Bearing Engineered Specifically for Skateboards
After several years of research Oust Inc. has developed a hybrid skateboard bearing named the "MOC SERIES".
These bearings meet all the critical factors for aggressive skateboarding. Unlike the common 608 bearings that are presently being used in the skateboarding industry which only require a radial load roll-out, OUST Inc. has designed a hybrid bearing which meet all the criteria for Static, Dynamic and Impact loads as well as bearing misalignment caused by torque.
These are side loads associated with carving, power slides, pumping and technical skating. The OUST MOC Series bearings are the FIRST and only bearing manufactured for skateboarding that achieve a matched coefficient of friction between radial load roll-out and tortional load roll out.
There are four bearings designed for specific skateboarding, the MOC 5 Street, MOC 5 Tech, MOC 7 Speed, and the MOC 9 Airr.... All four have the same structural design but there are changes in the cage, seal, ball grade and finish. The MOC 9 Airr... has also been strengthened and reduced in weight. Specifically designed for maximum performance in Technical, Street, Vert and Slalom!

The moc 9 are supposedly the best ...

More expensive than the others but if I can get this going with enough people ... we can shoot for the best at a good price

I'm down for the 5-tech or 7's. I know the 9's are gonna be overkill for my needs. Plus, I'd like to be able to afford to get 2 sets to compare. Ideally, I'd want to try a set of 5's and 7's, depending on price. Do we need to all order the same spec bearing or do we just need 30+ orders?

Oh I forgot to ask....

Do any of you care if it's in the retail package?

Because I can get them sans the fancy packaging ... I'm assuming it will cost a little less
