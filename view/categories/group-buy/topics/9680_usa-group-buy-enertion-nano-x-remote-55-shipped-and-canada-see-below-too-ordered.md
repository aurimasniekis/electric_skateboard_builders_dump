Who's wondering abt this Nano-X Remote?
--------

Looking to organize a NANO-X ONLY group buy.

The price will be between $55-$57 per set shipped in the USA. Price is based on the AUD $63.50 price, exchange rate used by PayPal and cost of mailer and mail. **Canada will be more $$

I'll amend the cost in this thread.

There wil be a cut off date and time since the sale price will end once Enertion gets stock. That will be announced on this thread.

The group buy will save you the cost of shipping if your total does not reach AUD $300.

Payment by PayPal. Please pay as friends and family so that I don't incur a fee. If you pay me the other way you need to compensate me for the fee.

Not sure when they will be shipped out...guessing in October ... just guessing 

If your down...chime in on the thread...I post details when it's time to fork over the money.

put me in for ONE. 

I added it on Enertion and four 12mm belts to the cart, saw the shipping from Australia at checkout and just closed the browser LOL. 

Zero track record suck. I hope Jason's people know what they are doing with their new PCB because it would suck having another LOSING remote

If @onloop is able to send me one to beta test....

I would be happy to set up a way to have various trusted people beta test it by mailing it to each other after a two day test .  A review should be given either written or video.

Just an idea

What was the shipping price? Whenever I ship from Australia to US and it's under 500 grams (which I'm sure it is) is only $16 AUD which puts it at around 12 or so USD.

Let me find out how these are packaged.

Not sure if they will have their own box or they need to be re packed.

This will help be determin if there is added cost for mailing and packaging if need be 

Canada postage is obviously more. So keep that in mind my northern brothers and sisters.

Keep you posted

Ok guys not sure when I'm gonna finally order them but.....

It's $55 all in shipped for USA üá∫üá∏ peeps.

Few things:

Espinosa.michael@gmail.com is my PayPal 

You MUST Include in the notes of the PayPal:

Your forum name
Real Name

Please pay as friends and family so I don't get pinged a fee...if you pay me the other way...you pay the additional cost by adding it to what you send me via PayPal.

Once you pay up...no backing out of the group by....so essentially no refunds.

For Canada I'll can charge you $50 USD now....and when they come...I can find out the postage cost to Canada and you can pay me then....How does that sound? 

That's abt it....


I'll accept funds as of now.

Hello there,

Just a quick update on the Nano-X hand controller. Firstly, please accept our sincerest apologies for the delays in shipment of the Nano-X, safety has always been our highest priority which meant we could not continue production until the controller had been fully tested. Once the testing was completed, we were promised that the controllers would be ready to ship by our factory several weeks ago, so we too; totally understand how frustrating the wait has been. 

On a good note however, we are happy to announce that production has finally finished, the boxes are packed and are commencing their transit from the factory to our warehouses in Europe, USA and Australia. We expect the shipments to arrive soon and have instructed our warehouses to do rapid fire shipments on arrival.

Again, we are extremely sorry for the extended period of waiting but rest assured, that we will be shipping to you as soon they arrive from the factory.

We thank you for your continued patience and support.

P.S. Attached a few photos of the Nano X packaging
