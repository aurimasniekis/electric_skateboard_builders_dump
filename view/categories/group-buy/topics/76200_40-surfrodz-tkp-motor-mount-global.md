Hey, just gauging interest for Surfrodz TKP motor mounts.

Here is the design, courtesy of @akhlut

![image|600x500](upload://9S5xnPMERgGMIInhRVumIBbRfCw.jpeg) 

It uses idlers but I need to figure out the belt length needed.

Getting quotes at the moment but you will be getting a good deal. Just need to know how many pieces to machine before I get a concrete price.

Shipping to anywhere in the world but europe is best! 

Are you interested?

@bigben
@brenternet
@Grozniy

Maybe you are interested?

Your names confuse me but great.

I think @skunk wanted 2 sets

And maybe @Grozniy

And I've made a smaller version for those who don't want idlers

There was a group buy for the clamp only but it looked like that's closed and there were 18 sets in the end. Maybe other people missed out and I can do it. I will read the other thread and see what's up

I'll take a look in the morning

Well I can use the same clamp for belt drives and gear drives so no issues there. Just a matter of buying custom gears and testing üòÄ

Testing bit is emphasized since 3 gears aren't standard

But I changed a few things since then and it removes another part that needed to be made

That will be a sick set up been thinking all summer on a sweet lil build I have a master chow 13 inch enclosure and I have that deck at my friend's shop just thinking how to go about the build .. I'm not a huge fan of belts. I have carbon exo drives but the wheels will be to big for it .. need to stay in the 85mm Max range

Its all @akhlut work. I was just going to redesign a motor plate and use the same clamp design. :slight_smile:

Let me know how it goes.

I haven't taken the pictures or uploaded them because they're not fully ready but they're very close. Same thing as my other mounts but the clamp has an inner hexagon.

@Boardnamics I was just reading some of your posts from your early days on caliber truck mounts and noticed that your cnc machine was as basic as mine, the difference is that you seemed to be getting clean cuts without coolant in aluminium whereas mine get messy without coolant... any advice?

I get incredibly accurate parts in Delrin but aluminium has always been a ball ache. I‚Äôve been using 2,3 and 4 flute end mills up till now and busking the feed rates... time for some proper research....
