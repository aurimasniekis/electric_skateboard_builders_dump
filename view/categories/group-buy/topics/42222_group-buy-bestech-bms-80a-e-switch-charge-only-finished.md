Another round is on, I need a few more so why not help people get theirs also

If you want to order fill this form out

They are closed till 1st of march because of Chinese new year
10 or 15BMSs will be ordered
Price is with untracked shipping, tracked shipping is about 5$ more

Im not making any profit of this, you can easily calculate that :slight_smile:

They do not have a store in Europe, also they only produce on order they have just too many models that its not worth to produce all of them and put it in a store

All expenses are included in the 67$ so no need to worry

Shipping is 36$ per 5 bms, we need 3 more people to make the order on the cheapest way, I could order then 10 now and leave the 2 bmss for @kane  for later because he was the last one, im about to send the order to bestech to get the receipt and probably tomorrow I will start collecting money :)

Hey, just being curious about what I may have missed here- I usderstand the s rating but fail to see how many cells can be added in parallel:
Is it a 10s1p or 10s 50p? Or whats's the range of cells in parallel? It doesnt seem to say. Then again the ability to read is a competitive advantage.

If you are planning to discharge more than 80A, this bms is not for you, 30Q max charge is 4A and if you have a 4p pack lets say, where will you find a 16A charger, or 20A wich is what this bms is capable of...
If you plan going over those huge numbers this is not the bms for you

Yup I confirm too.

Since it's the HCX-D223V1 model, I think it will be ok with the Space Cell, otherwise I will resell it at same price at the forum, no problem.

Yes - I understand. I should have written 4.2V as I was referring to the balance voltage. From what I understand it means that it starts balance the cells when they reach 4.2V. So basically if you want to charge only to 41V (at 10S) you will never balance the pack. Am I right? Is it possible to reduce the balance voltage to for example 4.1V?

Hmm i dont know if you guys had this discussion before but there is that thing where the balancing function isn’t working if you do not charge the pack fully since charging is made at the end of the charge? 

So if the bms limit is 4.15 does it still do the thing?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the overcharge release voltage is not the same as regular charging voltage right? The overcharge detection looks to be set at 4.3 so you can still charge to 4.2 normally.

[/quote]
 If the charger only outputs 42v then it can only charge the battery to 42v because voltage is pressure and current is flow.
Once the pressure inside the battery reaches the pressure in the charger, it stops the flow of electrons from the charger to the battery.

The thing that you have to be concerned about is Regen braking.
Because regen braking produces higher voltage and  will continue to charge your battery to 43v before the bms stops the flow to the battery and then only if you are discharging through the bms.

I have tested the theory by braking downhill on a full battery while monitoring battery voltage. 
Once my battery reached my bms's over charge detection value of 4.28 per cell  the voltage of my battery stopped increasing.
Then once I reached the bottom of the hill and got off the brakes, my battery voltage quickly came back down to 4.2v per cell.
It seems that the bms is dissipating the excess current into heat.
I conducted this test several times on a steep but relatively short hill. 
The only concern that I would have is that if this was done on a very long downhill decent, that the bms might overheat and shutdown.

Solder on the leads and plug in, thats it

10s 60$

(http://www.bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D596.html) with built in eswitch 20A charge 80A discharge 


These prices do not include shipping, untracked shipping is 7$ to europe and tracked should be around 12$

Forgive my ignorance but why does anyone need the discharge function?  Don't most people just bypass the discharge function on a BMS.

Hey guys, 
Just wanted to share a bit. I’m working with some new models from bestech and they are really versatile for direct discharge setup where space is short.

Size comparison to the d140. 
They come in both 10s and 12s
One is super compact and the other has a case for out of pack application.

looks good from the size factor, but what´s the max discharge current for them?
E-switch function included?

for direct discharge setup
[/quote]
For me it sounds like it’s a charge/discharge bms.
That the d140 just used for charge only and doesn’t come with an e-switch i know.

Yes, that is correct. And to be honest we don’t recommend discharge through bms anymore for several reasons. 
One, added resistance to your pack, loose in power during discharge ( heat ) 
Two, it’s a fiction that was needed early in the industry because of limited tech. Esc and motor limits. Your esc can regulate input/ regulate discharge. With much smoother cut outs and you can fine tune that. Not a bms that’s limited at 50a,80a,or100a. No more face plants 
Three, you have full control over what your battery can do. Instead of system begging for more it can take what it wants as its needed. 
Four, volt sag is improved access the board in terms of frequency and duration. 
Five, space   The older tank models for discharge are big. And cost 60$plus. If you want a small unit with discharge at high amps and e switch they have them for twice as much. 100$ 
But are available. 

As a battery builder we look at all aspects of the item. From making it to buying it. If we won’t buy it, we won’t sell it. 
Stripping away the over kill and unnecessary redundant fictions only helps improve the product and the end user experience.
