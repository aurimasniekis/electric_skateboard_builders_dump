just as before.
here it is
https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc4-12-100a

and here's where you need to fill in the form
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ak5eUwpS4wBmHSVPdw_862PvcoRRrHKPZIPnRpab5xA/edit

Flipsky have shown to be fast at getting them out and i get them out quickly as well and you get tracking and usps priority which is maybe two days shipping.

and the bad news...i just got...its not this wednesday and "next wednesday" means NEXT wednesday.   so we have a week and couple days.  sorry folks surprise to me.  the 6.6s came immediately.  if you want your bucks back pm me and easy.
but they do ship very fast, like 3 days, and i can get them to you in 2 to 3 days after with usps priority.

I had two packages lost recently using usps priority. Never happened before and now twice.  Usps priority is insured for only 50$ standard I think and have to confirm that but writing to offer more insurance. Iâ€™ll find the details on cost and if u want to do it we can figure it before I ship. They should be shipped to me today.

Kinda bummed after waiting a month. At #13 I thought I was in the first batch, but guess not. And now don't know when it'll arrive. Don't really need a 6.6 but if the wait is too long, I might have to change..

Iâ€™m pretty sure I sent to everyone in 
The first buy.  Iâ€™m offering the 6s cheap to people in the dual second group buy so we donâ€™t have to wait n can end it.  Iâ€™m not doing anymore group buys and Iâ€™m too busy and too much time

@Hummie Now that people are waiting for the 2nd group buy why donâ€™t you just order it right away? I guess not many people want to switch to two 6.6s because of the price (also the reason why people lined up for this dual 4.20)

Ten at least. If not fifteen. I donâ€™t know. U want the bucks back or the 6.6s. Itâ€™s too long a wait n Iâ€™m hoping to be done doing group buys on these things and hope someone else takes over.

Looks like I was in the second group buy and not the first :( 

This works out though since it turns out I don't need a new esc to fix my board, when u got time to do refunds thatd be great

@dollabillplz the email address you posted on the google doc isn't showing in my paypal.   anyone else who was in on the second dual group buy, and even if you were writing to me privately, please write here to make it easier, tell me the email address you paypaled me from and if you want the 6.6s I got instead at 220 for both including shipping and insurance or refund

Hi Hummie, may I switch to 2x 6.6 please? Iâ€™m trying to finish my board before I go on vacation, so time is of the essence!

My email is: RRXX

Should I send the difference through PayPal?
Please let me know,

And thank you for the hard work!
