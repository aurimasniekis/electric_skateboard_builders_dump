hi,

someone in europe are interested in a set of TorqueBoards 218mm trucks?
collections/featured-items/products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks

i would like to know how many people are interested to buying some, maybe if we are some people here we can get some discount or at least paying less customs...

i like those trucks because is the only way to use all terrain wheels in a regular longboard, because calibers trucks are too short to fit that kind of wheels
![58|281x500](upload://1Y1UoL9dD94Rybi1nSvtWOhbrWE.jpeg)

let me now, leave a comment below :)

thanks,
Miquel

I have a set of these and can tell you guys they are great quality.

One word of caution though, they come with spacers and you need to run them with a washer and spacer on the inside of the wheels.  You can't run them without as the thread on the end is not long enough.

I can take the GB if there is still enough interest (5-10 people) and providing we can get decent discount from TorqueBoards.

As I recently imported pretty big order from them and deal with customs quite often I can give you pretty accurate numbers of the import costs on the order of this magnitude.

Simplified it would be selling price + 5% customs + 22% VAT + shipping inside EU. I have shipped these trucks already, know the weight and even have the boxes so I can go to post office and get the shipping quote to your country.

Here is example, if we get 15% discount which would be $55 price per set of trucks:

$55 * 1.05 * 1.22 = $70 + around $15 shipping in EU = $85 or 68€

Let me know if you're interested and we can get this back up!

Okay, here is the form to fill for the GB.

You can set the price limit and once I get the price from TorqueBoards and EU shipping price to your destination, you will be either in or out. I will copy responses to the spreadsheet later on and share that as well.

Expected price is anywhere between 60€ - 80€ per set, as you can see from calculations few posts above.

If I we're you I'd bump price to 85-90 with a mass of these at high value the import tax is gonna knock the leader on his/her respective ass. Every 100 euros is roughly 15-20euros more depending on carrier. 

Just throwing it out there.

Alright, few others signed up as well already!

I will be creating a spreadsheet today and will have EU shipping costs for everyone ready tomorrow. Once at least 10 people sign up, I will talk to TorqueBoards regarding group buy quantity discount, if they give us any.

Once again, if you haven't done it yet, fill this form for the EU group buy of TorqueBoards 218mm Trucks:

@DavidBanner @JonathanLau1983  
guys, fill out the form if you haven't already..

With DavidBanner and JonathanLau1983 in, we're at 13 people (14 sets). Everyone after 15 sets will be on reserve list, which means that they will be in if someone from first 13 drops out. Reason is simply because of quantity and import. Importing large quantity of same item could trigger some red flags which would mean more bureaucracy and additional costs for me.

I will see if I can get a decent price from @torqueboards today. Hoping Dexter can hook us up with decent price for 14-15 sets of trucks? :)

Edit
**[Spreadsheet](https://goo.gl/gE4PzY)** updated, that's 15 sets of trucks people, nice! :)

If you just came here, fill the **[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrP5XuveIyh09CsUb5W2X0uqUxv3li8Q22j-4LCwlYhtyrBA/viewform)** to be a part of the group buy. New signups will be on reserve since we reached 15 sets.

Alright guys, currently crunching numbers and will update the spreadsheet with new participants and all the data later in the evening (night) :)

Edit: [spreadsheet](https://goo.gl/gE4PzY) updated. The discount isn't what we hoped for but I still took the lowest possible variant (out of 3) and went with that. Final price is out of budget for many that signed up. I need to get some sleep now but let me know your thoughts. Shall we proceed or not? Maybe wait for the Black Friday 2018, those trucks were $50 damn :)

Well. given monkey's groupbuy (9ppl) and him presenting us this premium price TB just lost his rep for me. I'm out.

[quote="monkey32, post:16, topic:35933, full:true"]
Alright gents, conversed with senior Torque and have prices.

50 euros per set

15 euro shipping
4.5% PayPal fee ( if no friends and family)

Comes out to 68 euros per set shipped.

This is more 20 euros less per set than if you ordered individually directly from DIY electric skate to Spain and then you are also saving yourself import taxes ( usually  euros 6-15 euros).

So I guestimate 20-30 euro savings per pair.

Yes, I know it's a shame but you have to take into account that there was no shipping costs from US in this GB as @monkey32 was traveling from the US,  and no taxes either. All in all the prices are not that far apart.
If you order directly you pay 105$ to EU, so 88€ at the current exchange rate. Then you have the import tax on top if you cannot avoid it (hard in the UK, elsewhere it's a question of luck)

Leaving shipping and imports aside. 50 per set or 79 per set is a huge difference. So afterwards including everything you could've just ordered them yourself instead of a group buy.

## \#82 Posted by: Moros Posted at: 2018-02-08T09:42:45.932Z Reads: 107

There should be no shipping cost anyway since they offer free shipping on orders over $300, and unless the shipping calculator is wrong is is only giving a price of $40 shipping for 17 sets .  Seems really low so I'm not sure if that is actually right

No it's correct: they say flat rate 40$ for international shipping.
At the top it says free shipping over 300$, but you go in the text it's over 400$. I don't know which one is correct.

for 10 pairs shipt 2 nl its 690$ so 69$ a piece then the 3% taxes end 21 % btw its = 85$ = 70 euro a piece then its 12 euro shipping for eu
thats 82 euro total, 
the set up of this group buy seems rly stupid (not out tow) but we just have to orgenise it a bit different

Alright guys, I was out for last two days but let me explain the pricing.

You cannot compare pricing monkey32 got in US and pricing for EU because of two reasons:

First and obvious, imports.
Second is shipping (and that's on TB side).

So, when I approached Dexter about our Group Buy he kindly explained tat it is not possible for him to give any discount given the shipping costs he would have to cover.

You need to understand that $30 or "free shipping over $300" is not at all free. Shipping 15 sets of trucks (more than 20kg) costs like $180.

So there was this to choose from:

1. $50 per set + I pay full shipping price 
2. 5% discount and free shipping

When you calculate both, you get to around $62 per set.

Now, factor in the EU import charges: $62 * 1.05 (customs charges) * 1.22 (VAT) = $79.5

Hope that clears things out. I tried, sorry.
```

Not trying to undermine anyone or trash talk- just giving you an idea of the discount tb gave me. 

This is a legit deal and no one is taking advantage of anything. This forum has some cheap mf'rs who will do whatever to save a buck and don't get what a pain gb can be or the fucking steal of a deal gb leaders provide.

I get it man, I just thought it would be good to explain the pricing because I was in a rush the other night and didn't explain everything in detail :) Transparency is good.
