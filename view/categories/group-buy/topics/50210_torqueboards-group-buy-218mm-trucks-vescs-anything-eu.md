This is the first GB I'm going from US to EU, I want to bring the stuff from US to EU for as low price as possible.
Next will be 97mm flywheels probably.

There should be some extra weight that can be filled in, you can order pulleys, vescs whatnot from their site

Prices
Trucks 80$   
VESC 110$
Pulleys 15$

Only 5 spots available for trucks, since they said that then we will need to pay additional charges for shipping
If there's the need maybe we can make another round

Shipping to UK is around 12$ for one set of trucks but you can put some more stuff like electronics inside for the same price
If you need something else just pm me

There are going to be some import fees, that's why the prices are little higher than there.



Batteries are not included in this.

If they weigh less than 1kg shipping is 15$, if more its 20$
I will see if there is any cheaper option

This is a package from TB only, If we were to order stuff from TB and mix it with other stuff the postage would be a killer

This way its only stuff from TB with free postage

Popcas will have to wait a few days...
