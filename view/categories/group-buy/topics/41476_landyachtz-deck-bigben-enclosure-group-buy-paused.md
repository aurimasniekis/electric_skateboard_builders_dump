I'd like to gauge interest for a potential group buy.

The idea is to have a choice of 2 or 3 decks from landyachtz along with @bigben 's gorgeous enclosures which have been moulded especially for those decks and will fit like a glove. Enclosures will be optional.

I am open to suggestions as to which decks, but will start a poll with a selection I think may be popular.

Shipping will be from the UK so this may be something that is more interesting to EU based people, but I will also get prices for international shipping so you can make your decision as shipping from the UK is usually surprisingly reasonable.

I will be able to post prices and shipping costs once we have worked out if there is enough interest.

Please choose which deck(s) you would be interested in, please only vote if you intend to take part in the group buy

I guess we might need to make it a two part shipping GB? that way it would give you time to produce the enclosures for any decks you don't currently have. Or we could hang onto the decks for a bit, wait for the enclosures to be ready and do one shipment to the buyers to cut down costs...

It's funny to see the Evo making a comeback. Personally I don't like the concave or the taper in the rear. They are better alternatives if you are looking for a wedged/dewedged deck similar to the Evo...

I have the 925 and its a rrally good board but if you try to make an enclosure for it it is pretty damn tricky
Also the board has some flex but just so much that it doesnt bother the enclosure atleast mine

I simply love my century 40, one of my most prized possessions..rollin on bennet vector/tracker rts trucks and 85mm defcon thane speedvent mangos and oust air 9 bearings...when you wanna roll far, these are awesome, but I avoid drop decks for electrics..

yeah, well happened with a few decks on here. See it one or 2 times then suddenly super popular for no obvious reason. Guess it comes from poeple being farily new to longboarding over all. 

Still poeple aren't buying decks they way you should by speccs according to you (height,weight, foot size,stance etc...) and not by design and or popularity.

It's simply an education problem, they are all skateboards, some are just long and people don't get that..it's all market hype really...and also I wish to add, gear is awesome and it pays to have the right gear for the job, but in the end, it's the skater not the board that makes it do rad stuff, so gear matters, but style matters more, and I'm not talking about what color it is or how you hold it, I'm talking about how you shred it!

more or less yeah. 

honestly for esk8 or at least for the majority of the community gear doesn't matter that much (talking only skate hardware, ofc quality vesc's etc matter) since this is still slow, relaxed and puts low stress on materials and wheels (most of us, yes there are expetions but the majority).

there is room for 10S3P, 102SP, 8S4P, if you use dual layer cell configuration in the pack
8S3P is probably the best option for single layer cells

Street Wing will have you covered on battery packs if anyone needs those.

I have seen a few of very small single motor builds just like that and loppy's does wheelies, it s great idea for a super small and light last mile commuter for like taking the subway or times when you don't want to lug a giant longer range tank around..I am making mine a little bigger though and more functional with a double kick tahoe deadhead..

looks like we have enough interest for the GB to be viable :slight_smile:

Now time for me to check stock levels, put some prices together and let you guys know what the total inc shipping price will be for each type of deck. This is going to take a little while, and given the holiday season is upon us might stretch into the new year.

It gives Ben some time to think of prices and see if we can find any of the decks prior to the GB delivery to give him a head-start on making the enclosures. Personally I am okay with a little wait for Ben to create the enclosures, so we could get the order and he can use those decks to create the moulds for the enclosures. 
What are everyone else's thoughts?

I have the first deck. 
I didn’t know if I’d be taken with it but I love it. It feels very solid and a great platform for me as a larger rider.
Looking at an enclosure 650mm long, tapered from the front to the rear to follow the form off the deck with a minimum internal width of 145mm.

I've got the first enclosure out of the mould for the evo. Should be good for a 10s5p or 12s4p dual focbox setup. No logo or go faster stripes yet. Could be added though.
The flange still needs a bit of cleaning up but I was excited so took some photos anyway!

It would be very tight, it would depend on bms I guess. Theres 640mm total length in the enclosure for a single stack. Theres no more length available, the only way to go is deeper. Then you could go 12s,8p.
I was talking to someone about building a deeper enclosure to accommodate a double stack. Of course if there's interest I'd build it!

## \#36 Posted by: bigben Posted at: 2017-12-30T21:16:00.394Z Reads: 288

25mm minimum in the centre of the deck plus whatever rubber gasket depth. I use 4mm and that compresses a little.
Why would you want 30-35mm? Lipos?
40mm would allow a double stack of Li-ons wouldn't it?

Yes I use lipos, but those are 25mm tall so it should be fine. My problem is that I want to keep using my Car ESC atleast for a little while, and it's about 34mm tall, so I hoped for maybe a 30mm tall enclosure and I would ask a friend to create a little pocket of 4-5mm in the deck for the rest of the esc to sit in.

I have a little bad news I am afraid.

Unfortunately there is no stock available of Evos or Dingy Emboss to be had at the moment.

But the 2018 range of Landyachtz will be in stock in March.

So I am going to pause this GB until March and then re-open it with the 2018 range of Landyachtz decks.

LiFe... Lower nominal voltage... Lithium iron phosphate batteries are  3.4v when fully charged... Un like Li-Ion and LiPoly which are 4.10 or 4.20 depending on your application.

Lifepo4 is 3.6v full, 3.3v nominal. A123 is a premium lifepo4 that can do unusually high rates of charge and discharge, and can take a lot of different types of abuse. Lowest I've seen is about $6.5/cell.

Oh and if you look at cycle life, it's cheaper or even with li!ion. 3x rated number of charge cycles, But you get less "C" capacity per dollar.

I have 2 different depth ones for the 9two5 and the evo enclosure. 
I’ve got a switch 40 that I can use to make an enclosure for that one but it’s pretty low.
Itching to make one for one of the shorter decks for a light commuter with a kick tail.

yes, I just need to find a couple of weeks where my workload is less than like 150% so I don't let anyone down by causing delays.

From my side... I’ve been sooo busy with life that this has slipped out of my mind. 
I’ve not had a dingy to hand though to make an enclosure. 
If one came along I’d make one for it.
