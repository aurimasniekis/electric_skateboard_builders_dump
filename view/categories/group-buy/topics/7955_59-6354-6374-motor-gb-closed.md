The motors can ship on Friday and I will have them by the next Tuesday, August 30th, 2016. Currently the manufacturer only has 10x 6354 and 13x 6374 in stock. They will be first come first serve. The price is **$59** for the 6354 and **$72** for the 6374. This price includes shipping to myself, but not from me to you. I will ask for initial payment of motors and ask for shipping payment later (PayPal). Shipping should be less that $10 to the US. Other countries are more than welcomed to buy as long as you pay the shipping, I am not sure how much it would be. Now for the specs:



* 190kv sensored 6354 / 6374
* 130mm power wire length / 180mm hall sensor wires (120 degree)
* 4mm bullet connectors
* 8mm shaft with keyway
* 0.2mm stator
* N42SH curved magnets
* NSK ball bearings
* 30mm **AND** 44mm mounting holes (works with TB and Enertion mounts)

Pictures are exact except for the shaft, they will be 8mm all the way and have a keyway. The stealthyness adds 12hp.

The same if not better than the SK3. They are very similar to DIY's, and are not cheap versions of enertion motors.

There was one typo all the others are correct, I will fix it.

Haha "censored", but u told everything in it,nice!  Those are really nice magnets, stator, and bearings.   I'd bet they're much better than enertion but maybe we will never know what's in the r-spec.  
How do u have mounting holes for both. Looks like just for one

Definitely would like to try.  Question on the 8mm shaft - length?  To compare w/ DIYes which is longer (helps w/ 12mm or 15mm setups).  Already have keyway or flat for keyway?  Circlips on shaft?

Hope you are having fun at your family gathering!

@Jono503 2nd **(1x 74)** :white_check_mark: 
@baxter 3rd (did not receive you pm) (2x 74's) :white_check_mark: 
@barajabali 4th (I did not want any branding on these for aesthetics and price, I assure you the are high quality, even @Hummie confirmed it) :x:
@jwoodsentertainment 5th **(2x 54 2x 74)** :white_check_mark: 
@Sboard342 6th **(2x 54)** :white_check_mark: 
@sl33py 7th (30mm length 8mm shaft, I will look into getting it longer) **(2x 54 2x 74)** :white_check_mark: 

Make sure to tell me what size you want, I will save these until tomorrow and then your spot will be given to the next person. The 54's look to be going fast and there should be some 74's left.

I'm worried about the motor wires, can they be swapped out for multi strand silicone? having a stiff cable like that is more prone to breakage.

I will look into it for the next round. I'm sure you could do it if you want. I haven't really heard of that problem before, perhaps you could wrap it in extra shrink tube or 'braided shrink sleeves'. Not sure of the proper name.
```

## \#45 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-08-21T03:56:15.798Z Reads: 285

The problem is the solid core copper. If you bend it back and forth to much, like when turning on esk8, the wire can break.
```

Hmm. Never heard of that before, I would only think that would happen if the wires are tight. I all ways leave them loose and havnt had any problems.

If you check all the other esk8 dealers, you'll see they use flexy wires. Never seen solid core break either, but definitely something to think about.

The wires are bendable (to an extent) so I don't think it is a problem. I will definitely look into it for future reference.
```

---
## \#49 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-08-21T04:10:02.964Z Reads: 265

```
Sure, but so is a paperclip. Once you bend a paper clip back and forth a couple times, it'll break. Same principle with stiff wires. When you turn back and forth a lot you can bend the wires back and forth as well and cause them to break.

@mishrasubhransu I would not worry about it. All tacon motors have the same kind of 'stiff' wires. No problems at all, once you put the motor wires in position they don't move all that much if there is slack in the wires. I have honestly used a tacon for over 100+ miles and have not had a single problem. I have not even heard of this until a little bit ago.

@DeathCookies @fuelre

I have calculated $68 USD via USPS for a medium flat rate box. This may require me to ship the motors out of the box they come in. It will be $89 USD via USPS for a large flat rate, this will NOT require me to take them out of the box. The dimension of the box are 12cm x 8cm x 8mm. For 4 motors that is 48cm x 16cm x 16cm*. You can see if you can find a cheaper rate.

*dimensions are length x width x height

Edit: is $34 USD a piece okay? I have packaging materials to keep the motors protected out of the box.

I did order a mount and motor pulley alongside the motor. I was excited to see how fast my package was on the way but then saw that the 6374s went OOS after my purchase, and that some people were having partial shipments.

Guess I'll most likely just see a motor mount and motor pulley. Still considering one of these 6374s. When's your cutoff?

I have the same wires in two of my 50mm motors but they super short. Definitely not saying it will snap after a long time, I'd just feel safer with flexy silicone. That said, I'd be glad to participate, but they wouldn't really give me much over my current chaka motors.

They have all the torque i want, and i take hills with ease. Ive heard a lot of burnt drv stories from 63mm's so I'll wait until the VESC 6 to get one. This motor or the rspec would actually be a downgrade in speed since mine are 200kv.

Yeah, that's exactly what I expected them to do. 

I have those stiff-phase-wire motors on my robots but they don't really move, so I don't have any first hand experience with the wires breaking. But what I have read on the forums is that they are the motor strand wires bunched together which are not very flexible and so may break over time. 

Also, I wanted at 6355 motor.

I honestly think they will not break. You guys are saying to change the shrink tube to silicone. I get that it may help, but it not changing the actual copper; what really matters. I have never heard of any motor wires breaking, ever and I read almost everything on the forum. Just my opinion. Don't mean it to be harsh.

I'm sure most people who setup 63mm's correctly run fine. But all the problems I hear come from 63mm users. Chaka himself says that he doesn't believe 63's are the best motors to use for 4.xx VESCs.

Do you actually have any of these motors as samples? have you tested them before selling them? how many different motors with these wires have you used to build electric skateboards with? "thinking" & "knowing" are very different.

[quote="JLabs, post:122, topic:7955"]
I have never heard of any motor wires breaking, ever and I read almost everything on the forum. Just my opinion. 
[/quote]

I can tell you the wires will snap off eventually if stressed!!

it's mostly due to the way they are installed & if that puts leverage & stress directly into those stiff wires when you are turning & carving.... the only way to isolate these wires is add more wire that is flexible.

basically, people will just need to cut the wires & install some decent high strand count silicone insulated wires to make sure the "bending-point" is where the flexy wires are & not where the stiffer windings are.

The picture is kind of bad, but the motor wires do not bend at all! They simply move an inch or so back and forth when carving, and the ESC wires take the small movements.

Of the 29k posts I have read on here, not once has someone said that their motor wires snapped. Not one.

If really needed people can spend less than $10 and replace the wires. I dont want anyone to get the wrong thoughts, and that is what is going on. I even had the manufacturer send me a video of her bending the wires to partially put your claims to rest. The only reason it is partial is because it is not over time. 

Of the 19 motors bought in the group buy (not selling them, yet) if anyone has motor wires snap I will personally send them the silicon wires to replace them for free. That is how confident I am in these wires.

That said I dont want this to turn into a fight about motor wires. I dropped the subject and agreed to disagree with the fellow forum members.

my advice is you should stop relying on other people & start ordering samples & testing products yourself in the real world... then you can confidently say things like **"i have personally ridden this product for xxxxKM's and never had that fault"**

Otherwise when you say **"i honestly think they will not break"** you might as well say **"i have no idea what will happen"**

this is not an attack, I am simply trying to help you build a credible reputation....

Replacing the crappy wires with silicon wires is such a pain..... It's not as easy as just replacing the wires... You have to hear shrink the new wires and solder the new wires properly....

These wires will start to deform and eventually snap after a few months. Worth it to have silicon wires off the bat. Source: my sk3.

Just a little update for you guys. Motors will be delivered tomorrow. I have an emergency remote coning from hummie on Thursday (my others took a crap). I will test all of the motors when I get the remote. In the mean time I will get the final shopping costs for everyone so that after I test the motors the can be sent immediately. 

Thanks again for your participation! I will be sure to upload pics tomorrow!

@barajabali @Blacksheep @chinzw @Michaelinvegas @Jinra

I will do a GB for the next batch after these are all shipped. 

For everyone in the GB, here is the plan. I have a date with the post office tomorrow. I will get prices and figure out what box to ship in. I will also test the motors tomorrow, even though they are tested by the manufacturer. 

Then Thursday, I will collect final shipping fees and try to ship them out. (no promises) They will defiantly be shipped by Saturday tho.

Okay, the date with the post office went well. PayPal me the following amount for what ever category you fall into. 

**$$ Shipping Price Pending Revision**

They will be shipped in Tyvek envelopes and I am putting their small cardboard box on the inside with bubble wrap and then the actual motor box on the inside. So they've I'll be very protected. If u want to shoot me a buck or two for the bubble wrap go ahead, but not necessary. Once you send payment send me a PM in the chat we already have. 

I still need to test the motors, but if I get payment today I **should** be able to ship tomorrow, takes 1-3 business days domestic.

Time to get to work! Will be off the forum for a little. 

To answer some questions I was asked over PM. The motors come with female 4.5mm bullet connectors, but not mounting hardware. The shaft specs are as follows:

6354: 20mm long, keyway; about 14mm long, 3mm wide, apprx 1.7mm deep

6374: 26mm long, keyway; about 19.5mm long, 3mm wide, apprx 1.7mm deep

I will have more updates tomorrow. Still set for the Saturday deadline. I have found a non pretty way of shipping them with the bag folded over, so do you care how a package looks as long as it is protected?

Has anyone been using FOC with the 6374 ?
@JLabs Do you have experience with it ? 

I'm about to get a VESC 4.12 latest hardware and software revision. I'd like to give it a try with a 10s3p battery pack.


Also I need to convert the sensor wire plug to be compatible with the VESC. I just ordered this [1]. Any tips on rewiring ?

red = 5v, black = gnd, white = temp, the rest are hall sensors. Order of the sensors doesn't matter as long as you do detection.

The order of ABC does not mater with the vesc, the motor detection will setup the hall table
