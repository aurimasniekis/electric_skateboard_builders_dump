Hi 
Finally I'm starting long awaited Group Buy. Those decks are in development since Nov 2017 and you can see the progress in this thread as find some detailed informations.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/another-integrated-deck-project/39107

Decks are made from Birch plywood and Oak veneers. It's a 3 stage process which was quite complicated to figure it out. It took a lot of time and money to get to this stage. There are two versions.
First one is a symmetrical design and second is a kick tail version. Decks will be coated with 2 layers of polyurethane matte varnish.
Lid is made from tekstolite but it might change.

Battery/electronics compartment is identical in both versions with following dimensions - 550x140x23mm (21mm+2mm sealing)

**No Kicktail version 150 euro**

![dim1|690x294](upload://pqhNL1TMqoZ00yUj5iIoiaqdCY.jpeg) 

**Kicktail version 160 euro**

![dim2|690x278](upload://yewluAHISReedkqz6ToEjJxopg8.jpeg) 

I'll also make available a file of riser that helps with wire routing and switch/charge port installation. I'm trying to produce it on CNC but can't find a good price for now.

Form is open for about two weeks from today ;)

@LukePL is the deck pressed to its concave before cnc'ed or just cnc'ed stright from a flat ply wood? And also can you take more pictures of your prototype inside and out?

What are the risks with this production?
What happens if you cant deliver?
Whats the maxload(kg) on these boards?
If I want both, is there a discount?

Looks great, just needs abit more info :slight_smile:

@Winfly it's flatcave/gaspedal shape and it's cnc'd from flat plywood. Please be more specific what do you want to see and I'll take those pictures tomorrow.

@DeathCookies One big compartment with dimensions in first post.

@linsus a lot of good ones :slight_smile:
- please open the form and there's some kind of estimation
- no it's not included because you all are in different parts of the world so I need to check all that and that is why I'm asking about country in the form
- I'll try to do some more. Ideally I would like to show finished board but mine is always in prototype because I need to check different options with it. I might finish my son soon and will post that for sure.
- the biggest risk is company that is doing cnc job but like I said before it's a third or fourth one and this one is good
- my initial plan was to finance it 100% but development took a lot of money and I'm still able to do it but that would freeze my other projects so I decided to collect money for some part of the whole production. I took my time to be sure that I can deliver but if something happen I'll refund everyone and just cancel my other projects. Payment through PayPal and I'm not asking for F&F.
- heaviest person that ride on it was around 100kg. I have one friend that is 140kg and I'll try to do destruction test with him and one of the prototypes. I couldn't break it and I have tried to do it on purpose.
- I think it's possible ;)

Personally, I like the shape and size but not so much of the choice of wood. Milling a flat cross grain ply for that concave edge makes it really easy to chip. If I were going to buy one, I will have to coat it and paint it. also not a big fan of that ply showing on the top. I will wait till you finish your son's before deciding if I like it.

Yes you did :slight_smile:

@briman05 Maple was in plan just at the beginning when I thought I will make it just by milling. Than I did some research and tests and best combo in my opinion is birch and oak. Deck is super strong and light. Those materials are widely available for me (I have 2 or 3 backup suppliers) and I can source them with high quality and ok prices. I have a lot of different veneers and it's very interesting how different they can behave. It's almost like different carbon cloths with different thickness and weave of fibers. This deck is a wood composite with core and outer layers ;)

@landonkun I'll start collect money in couple of days and from the time that payments are done about 3 weeks to start shipping.

I want to ask you all about something. I think I found a good way to seal top cover and still make it easy to get inside. At the beginning I planed to just put grip tape on without any cut for lid and that would seal everything. Of course that is perfect scenario when your build is so good that you don't need to look inside. Reality is that we, builders will always tweak something. Take a look at this and tell me what you think.....
![IMG_20190126_165540_HHT|375x500](upload://2IqdClwifY8DeLVvXYVic6vh7vd.jpeg) ![IMG_20190126_165832|375x500](upload://c5VBh7i9gcyI4Y1jcDkSmgocVM7.jpeg) 
It's a big velcro type material. Lid is cut and grip tape will be applied to velour with adhesive. This way we'll be able to take off and put on any grip tape countless times and it will act like a seal for the lid. I have some samples of this material. Can't test it as it's -10C here but this is industrial stuff and I believe it will work perfect.
```

Took me a while to understand what you mean. Yeah, having griptape attach to the board via velcro is a good idea! Definitely needs testing though, as I could imagine that having a velcro layer between the griptape and board might decrease board-feel, since it could act like a layer of unwanted cushioning. I'd love to see how it comes out, but personally can't see myself opening up the lid once the build with it is finished.

I would really like to see that in action :) Do I get it right: The first picture shows it with regular griptape with a cut out lid and the second the velcro stuff? 
Today I printed my first MOV-E N.E.S.E 4s3p module slightly modified to fit the deck (slighty less than 140mm wide (incl. screws), 146,5mm long and 22mm high). Its a really tight fit but in the end I'll have 2 Focboxes, remote receiver, metr pro and led driver in there plus a 12s3p battery :)

I have to test it. Water have surface tension that doesn't allow to penetrate small gaps. Only place that water could get in is edge and gravity will pull water down not horizontal so i hope that even water splash won't go through. I'm waiting for self adhesive velour and this board is going to have a shower :D

Hey all ;)
Tomorrow I'll have shipping costs for you and I'll send you emails with payment details. I have already ordered material (plywood, veneers, glue ect.) but will start production after receiving most of the payments. I'm aware that some of you are undecided so I won't wait for all payments.
I'm leaving the form open for few days and it will be closed by the end of the week. 
After production starts it's going to be 3-4weeks for decks to be shipped.  
Enormous thanks to all of you who support this project :)

Could you test the velcro yet? I still have the following concern:
you drive in wet conditions, you do make a coffee break and put the board on the side. I do that to prevent it from rolling anywhere. Then the water could go into the lid. My aim is to make it somehow waterproof or as much as possible

The best way for a full seal would be to have a layer of vinyl like material that fully seals the top of the deck. The grip tape is then put on top of this. Unfortunately if you need to open it up then you would have to cut the grip/vinyl up

You are right it doesn't look good because like I wrote it's a first prototype that I made with vacuum bag and vacuum cleaner. It looks so bad that I never showed a single picture of it. As I remember it was made on a ready 100% CNC'ed deck which was additional difficulty but thanks to this experiment I realize that it has to be 3 stage process to make it perfect. So no worries non of final decks will look like that ;)
It's good to see how well it holds up even when lamination is super bad :D

Without risers for routing the cables, I'm unsure how else you could even wire the motors (unless you drill out holes yourself)

I was planning on drilling a hole for the charge port, but I'm going to use a push-to-start to avoid having a button.

One day technology will be advanced enough to wirelessly charge cells similar to smartphones. 

Someday.. someday.

Then there will be zero holes on the deck. Pad the inside nicely and insulate everything well and never have to open the top ever again :joy:

Hmm, since charging happens through a BMS, I think you can safely short-circuit the charging port when it isn't in use. (Or rather, it's safe to touch the terminals.) You could have the negative terminal connect to one truck, and the positive terminal to the other truck, and then have a charging cable that splits up and goes to each truck :smiley:

@rusins it is arround 16mm and I have used 15mm riser but with the new wheel wells it can be less. As always it depends what is your wheel size, trucks, bushings....

Good news! :smiley: So, in case anyone else needs bolt dimensions; without risers:

16mm deck + 5mm caliber 2 baseplate + 5mm nut + 1mm washer = 27mm at least

With the Riptide tunnel riser (14mm) that's 41mm at least. (Irregardless of wheel size or bushings ;P )

Hi Guys!
Sorry but wanted to get back with pictures but don't have them. I see that it was too much to ask from them as they are quite busy. I have to go and pick up laminated boards on Thursday. Didn't expect that but they said that they won't send them because they are afraid of transport damages. I asked them to make some special box to safely pack those semi decks but again I heard "no". A bit of a dick move but to be honest we didn't agree upon that at the beginning so yeah I have to make the trip. So Thursday I should have them in my hand. Guy that is doing CNC said that he needs 3 days so not so far from finish. Thank you for your patience and for all reminders especially form @landonkun ;)

Update time:
Unfortunately not the one that every one would like to read.....
Got semi decks on Thursday and DPD was supposed to pick them up on Friday but as usual they took them on Monday and will deliver tomorrow and it's not the bad part....
CNC guy is away on some business trip from tomorrow (one week) so he can start mill them next Wednesday. At this point what I really wish is to ship them in April. I have informed a company that will do coating about changes that they could book the date for me so this should be ok. This is a last time that I'm making a production with so many different stages and suppliers. Next one will be on my own press with own CNC or won't be at all. I know that weather is good for riding and you all want to get them asap but there's nothing I can do more at this point.

Basically I am on this forum only to see innovations. So bored to see more and more pre built stuffs in this world. We will end it up having all the same clone deck. That's why I do what I do to make real what I see or better dream. Then when I see the same I keep eyes on it. So if you mainly check innovations and new small production runs there is not too much to read about it. Unfortunately I would say!
I follow what you do because no random company can make something similar without the heart. THey will make it fast but without soul.

This black thing on board is self adhesive so you'll still have some glue on the board. I was thinking that ordinary hooks are to long and get destroyed by stepping on them and from rider weight. So I was looking for something with short little hooks and found this

Hi Guys :slight_smile:
First deck today is out from CNC. It's a special walnut version. You can see on the pictures that there are some faults :( I need to receive this deck for inspection. Probably I'll have to tweak CAM a bit because he said that there are some problems with retract heights and some other things. I have to be sure to give him a green light for all of them. Pics are not so nice but hope you'll enjoy them.

Hey 
Guys I'll write an update in the evening.

Ok so I received a deck yesterday and tweek CAM to avoid mistakes plus make some small changes as I notice that kicktail version could use larger area for trucks.
![IMG_20190424_185731|666x500](upload://uhXU9eDwLFlhcCuVjOx7I9nTRlp.jpeg) 

 I'm super happy that this guy informed me after one piece that there's something wrong because if he just do them all this way it would be very bad.
I'll give him a green light tomorrow.
@Acido to be honest I don't know because I'm so stressed about it that it's taking away whole pleasure. I can't take peoples money and make them wait for over 3 months I just can't do it. By the end of May I'll have my own CNC and I'm also in talks with new supplier of pressed plywood with concave. 
![IMG_20190326_152407|666x500](upload://6ezxAtcGDuuIp9OFkgEDK6TUTjw.jpeg) 

Also I'm building this so for sure I'll make some test samples and if it goes smooth I'll make another GB.

I was able to test fit 100mm wheels and to be honest it seems that they could work :slight_smile:![IMG_20190424_185538|690x343](upload://d5qpc0vgyj1JK8dXSx1KPHYxesP.jpeg) ![IMG_20190424_185702|690x460](upload://zs6D8zhZuQRI6CLHtlSvn4daYcY.jpeg)

@AlanZhou best way is to put them in risers like those.

@visnu777 CNC still in progress. Shitty thing is that we have another holiday in Poland as 1st and 3rd of May are of work so tomorrow is last working day and all starts on monday :(  I'm proud that we had first in Europe and second in the world constitution (it was in 1791) but not good regarding our case. I'll know more on monday.

I feel all your pain Guys but today a big holiday here so everything is closed. Like I wrote before I'll hit CNC guy on Monday for some info. 

@AlanZhou 10s5p is a bit optimistic as you would need 500mm of lenght for cells only and Unity is 64mm. Realistically 10s4p in 30 inch deck is as dense you can do and you'll have to be very precise
 in that build.   
@CarbonV looks good :) What is the width of those cell holders together?

Didn't manage to reach him via phone today. I'll send an email and he always respond next day.

IMPORTANT QUESTION. Are there some of you that can wait a bit longer. Obvious thing to do is to send decks as I received payments but I'm sure that not everyone will start a build right away. To make things faster I might split this batch a bit (not much a week or so difference).
Please let me know. Thanks

I remember when the group buy first started, you had mentioned that you waited a bit to start building them because only half the people (or less than half?) had paid at the time. I'd suggest simply sending out the boards in order of people who made payments first. That seems the most fair to me.

Update. :sweat:
CNC guy did a very so so job and two major mistakes. It's a lot more hand finishing that it was on prototypes. 

Problem no 1. is that he did something wrong with heights. Because of that theres a tiny spot on some wheel wells that is veeeery thin and in some cases a little hole. I had to fix that by laminating glass fiber with epoxy resin. Not a huge thing but need a bit of time.

Problem no 2. is With kicktail versions. The depth of chamber is 3 to 4mm to small and same goes wit recessed area for lid. It makes impossible to install lid by itself and not to mention with sealing. So sad info is that kicktails are on the way to cnc guy to correct that. 

Looking at how bad he is not noticing that I'm so happy that it's not other way around because I can still fix that. 

So I'll start sending first no kicktail versions after weekend.

Below some pics with the things I'm talking about and I realize that I never showed any picture of whole bunch of those decks so I understand that some of you might even doubt in their existence.![IMG_20190520_170849|666x500](upload://mhzdtHi6ohnIlUrmiadtTujS2QE.jpeg) ![IMG_20190520_164729|375x500](upload://i2GKZXuxzQYwiuiiIvxxnvgRtac.jpeg) ![IMG_20190520_164057|375x500](upload://4RcxFfnbeZzdtAn6kjnAtvlDq2x.jpeg) ![IMG_20190523_114746|666x500](upload://nPhYXXwhBxIUXTRs5uiTvFXqVSN.jpeg)

That's a damn shame to put such complacency in such a nicely designed board. Hope it gets worked out because I'll probably be adding this to the builders resource thread when it starts finding its way to the builders.

Can I ask an honest question?

Was it a machine shop actually didn't follow the technical drawing provided (or plugged in to CNC model file) or was there a small error within tolerances/otherwise in the file themselves?

Just curious, as I'm currently designing a TON of shit on the fly, half if which I don't even have the mating parts of... being told that the machine shop knows well enough when we just use a general call-out lmao. 

I've got a bad feeling some shit is gonna come back out of spec for me, but the people in charge will have to learn that the hard way.

@s5300 To be honest I can't be sure as I wasn't there but everything is ok wit h file and design. Most probably it's a fixture fault and super bad QC. From my side now I would make tolerances much bigger as this is wood material so you can't transfer a requirements from machining aluminium to wood. 

@pat.speed yes I'm holding a final payment to see how he make corrections. He's a good guy just bite more than he can chew (and because of that I'm kind of in same situation)

@DeathCookies there's no chance that could happen. This flaw is only visual and mostly from inside. Once I repair it you won't notice it from outside. Remember there are two veneers that are laminated and adding to strength. It's a overkill but overkill is good :slight_smile:

@visnu777 thank you! And huge thanks to all of you Guys. You are awesome supporters!

I was told two boards would be shipping every day from Monday but I am under the impression that is not happening. Had arranged with a friend to build next Friday but don't even think that's going to happen.
I really like the design and have all the respect for @LukePL but I would really love to get along with this build. All the other gear has been sitting here for over three months now getting outdated. I payed on February the 6th. That is almost 4 months ago.

Would love to get an update with a real ETA.

Here's a screenshot from last winter:

![Screenshot_20190129-142158~01|365x500](upload://62UMsAzaumPaaYheJWdsXwQuv6J.png) 

I dunno how cold it gets in Sweden, but -32¬∞C (up to -45¬∞C with windchill) is, in my personal opinion, BAD WEATHER :wink:

Cars don't start... exposed skin gets frostbitten in minutes, possibly seconds. There is no way anyone would be crazy enough to try an electric board (not that one would even work). And it's extremely flat here, so no snowboarding to be done. Not that you'd want to anyway. Winter = go inside somewhere warm.

Basic functionality is there, I'll add a charging port and a balance port and after that I'll do another Epoxy coating run to make everything shine again :) I already put in some wiring to add some lights later.

Hi Guys! I'm back and hope won't have any more absence. Obvious question is what happen. I won't go into details as I'm quite private person but you deserve an explanation. I had so sort of epilepsy attacks. Not a typical ones and still don't have final diagnostic. Probably many people live with that but for me it was quite a hit as I always was super healthy. 
My wife (Pure Gold!) helped me as she could to send some and I can tell you that 90% will be send next week. 
I'll try to go through all DMs and catch up answering your questions.
Thank you all!

I know it's not the same, but a few months back I had some serious panic attacks, and it really set me back for a lot of work-related things. It was difficult to talk about openly to clients too, without sounding like a crazy person.

In other news....

GREAT SUCCESS üëçüëç

yes then is 45 degree :wink:
One trick to increase stability, next to change bushing and pivot cup, is to lower by 5 degree (or more) the rear truck. That doesn't change too much the ability ot turn that you want in the front truck but prevent the rear truck from starting wobbling. In most of the case wobbling starts from the rear truck and then is transmitted to the front. Although you feel it only once it reaches the front truck

I really hope for all of you to get your own MOV-E soon, its a wonderful deck. I rode it a lot since I finished it and I love it. The other board I have is no fun anymore, I hope when Luke is better he'll do another run of the kicktail version and I'll move everything in there when I get it :D
Btw: As you might have noticed: I replaced the lid. I used 2mm ABS sheet, first I cut out a copy of Lukes lid, tried if its fits and then glued it with acetone to the top part which overlaps at least 1,5cm (something like that). I drilled the holes exactly in the same spots as before also with the help of Lukes lid. After all that I added a layer of CF to fit the look and make the stuff stiffer than before :)
Second: I'm in the process to make some bumpers for the axle which is a little bit out of the deck (I think you've already seen that on Lukes pictures)


Get better soon @LukePL

This man visited the forum every day for over a year. Then say's he's having major health issues, and then disappears. Something tells me that the serious health issues may be preventing him from prioritising this right now. \
epileptic seizures are a serious thing, and even possibly a sigh of even worse health issues, that may not have been mentioned here. For all you know, he could be hospitalised. \
I understand not hearing anything back suck big time, But think if you were in his shoes.

Yeah @chaki, tbh, get a refund through however you paid and fuck off. Health issues like this suck absolute ass. Dude was an active community member for a longass time and is now in a most likely abysmal state of health given the fact he's completely had to stay away from the forum. In my times lurking/posting here, I've had a few extended hospital stays. Typically, I would be in the forum still, but there were some moments of feeling like absolute shit where I didn't want to touch anything. Sounds like he might be dealing with close to that.

Hi Guys :hot_face:
Not sure what can I say..... At this point my condition is irrelevant for you as no matter what happen this GB is total fuck up for almost all of you :frowning:
Decks are ready to ship but I was trying to hire a guy to finish them first and in the end my brother in law helped me. Some of you bounced of my email but its working now. I even wasn't able to pay for my domain so that why it stop working. There are some cases open in PayPal and I'll look into how to handle them this week. In any questions or requests please write me an email.
Once again super sorry....

Buccaneer Series are available in a smaller version ;) Mhh, but yours might allow higher amps while charging so you can leave the separate main charging cable...

I have a 12pole balancer connector and a QS8 for main power line, which is this big since I can also add the range extender over that port.

This is what you want for balance and charge all together. After using the polymer cap seal version, I'd opt for the screw on cap version. You don't want a plastic aviation plug, somebody used one before and said it literally just kinda disintegrated over time from esk8 vibrations

Anyone interested in a used single Hammock baseplate for the MOV-E? It fits a front paris V2 truck (45¬∞ i think) perfectly on this deck with a flat angle making the tail speed wobble resistant while the front stays agile. Since the elofties for my Rocket Board are TKP I can't use it anymore but maybe someone here wants it? 50‚Ç¨ plus shipping. PM me when interested, on the other forum would be fastest ;)

Sorry guys. I have money on PayPal but because of refunds they are blocked as insurance policy or something like that. I'm during the process with them to unlock funds to be able to make those refund for you. You are the last three cases that I have to deal with and belive me want to do it asap!

Hey Guys
This is for last people waiting for refounds. Please check if you can do it by PayPal still. I cant't unlock funds to this day. I belive that they block them for that purppse. Also please let me know by email or better via PM on other forum because this one is not working very often and I'm not here any more.
