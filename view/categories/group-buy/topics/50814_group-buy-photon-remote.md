Hi guys, 

I've been following @Wajdi 's Photon remote thread and I've noticed that there is quite some interest in a group buy. 
At this point I'm just gauging interest.  If we can get 10+ people we can get bulk discount of **10%** and we can kick this off.

**REMOTE**

The remote comes with a receiver, UART cable, and an online manual.
One remote will be **â‚¬144** excluding shipping from me to you.

You can also order extra receivers.
Extra receivers will be **â‚¬30** each.

**SHIPPING**

Shipping will be around **10**-**15** bucks. Around **20** if you live like in Antartica or something :yum: .
Keep in mind shipping prices are all guesstimates.

People outside the EU are also free to take part but shipping will most likely be more expensive.

**If you want to participate please fill in the form below.**

https://goo.gl/forms/CWfvxzaxMtzoxB3J3

All payments will be done through Paypal.

**This post will be updated as things change, so check back if you don't want to miss a thing.**

I'm located in The Netherlands. 

Cheers.

Bu no-one is selling the comlete firefly remote until now, right ?
I menad it seems to be manageable in DIY, but still in my case its a matter of spare Time.

I like the photon more, that display with real-time data is really appealing for me.

```
That DIY remote is also all about real time data as well. It is also possible to use one remote for all of your boards but it comes with potential flaws which you will have to deal with yourself. Once you iron them out it is a great remote. Even if you buy from someone i imagine it will cost you around 50 euros which is one third of a photon remote.

yet still it has only a very small display where you cant see everything like the photon.

yes, display could have been bigger and its just a matter of design. bigger display is almost the same price as the one in DIY but at the end its a personal preference.

If you're interested in taking part let me know and please stay on topic.
Thank you all for your consideration & much love.

How many remotes do you want? There will be no VAT as I'll mark all items as gifts. I'll update the original thread post to include any updates so keep an eye on it if you don't want to miss something. Maybe I'll add a google form as well.

EDIT: Google form added. Please fill it in.

If there is a possibility of more than one receiver (in order to use with multiple boards) - bind to board in use, then I'm interested for sure, can you check with @Wajdi

@banjaxxed I implemented that feature on the new FW v0.4.
You can setup up to 4 different boards to the same remote, and each board can have up to 4 receivers.

And that I see the differentiator along with the form and large screen which makes it more desirable to the diy crowd, for me I'm not able until the end of the month, if I can pay then I'm probably in depending on receiver cost for 1 or 2 extra receivers

Ã„h, "gifts" i do not think that gift is a term to not pay VAT, specially if you import 10 or more pieces.

At leat in Austrai there is a rule that everything over a value of 150â‚¬ including Shipping costs you'll have to pay VAT not matter if its a new, used or gifted Item.

So pretty sure you have to count with 20% VAT and between 2-5% of the toatl prive for toll Import costs.

https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/abroad_and_customs/receiving_goods_from_abroad/internet_purchases

Are you receiving goods from abroad, from private individuals, e.g. from family members or friends? Is the value not more than â‚¬ 45? Then you do not pay taxes to import the goods. 

Is the value over â‚¬ 45, but no more than â‚¬ 700? Then you pay 2.5% of the value of the goods and VAT (0 or 6 or 21%).

what about splitting up in 2 orders? in germany i would pay 19% alone if i just order 1 remote.. so it would cost 200â‚¬ for me, that is way too much.

## \#28 Posted by: RedEagle Posted at: 2018-04-01T19:29:43.176Z Reads: 137

This could work but then I'll have to pay shipping twice. I'll have to work out the kinks with @Wajdi.
Total amount to pay per remote would still be under 200 bucks though.

## \#29 Posted by: Acidfie Posted at: 2018-04-01T19:31:54.522Z Reads: 138

well wajdi said shipping is 30 flat or not? better pay shipping for 5 remotes at 30â‚¬ than the full vat on every item or not?

or does the value count on the whole order?
```

---
## \#30 Posted by: RedEagle Posted at: 2018-04-01T19:39:13.572Z Reads: 133

The value counts on the whole order. Say the total amount is 1500 euros. Add 2.5% of 1500 on top of that. Then I'd have to pay 21% vat above that so yeah.. Total amount tax to pay â‚¬322,88
So in the end I have to fork out around 1.822,88
And that's just an estimate.. Lol

i think splitting up is the way to go in this case. better 3x times shipping cost than 20% vat

in my expereience reading is not the best way to find that out.
Contact your Toll-bureou of your country ant tell them what you want to import -> and don't try to tell them lies or understate the reals cost.....they will be able to tell you axactly what you have to pay at the end.  
Reading that stuff on websites will give you many different optinions and probably old infos, caus tax law is changing too.

In my experience with Austrian Tax/Toll  in most cases it was cheaper to order a single item under 150â‚¬ and save toll (or the seller was so kind and wrote a lowered invoice -> but in this case be careful again and pay in two pieces so that oune paypal transaction ist under 150â‚¬)

Would like to know the final price aswell before joining. 

Ordering one would be around 180 eur total (incl. import/vat/tax/shipping), what are we looking at here?
```

## \#39 Posted by: notger Posted at: 2018-04-01T22:08:33.069Z Reads: 125

```
Just a little Calculation Example
185$ Photon plus shipping = exactly 150 â‚¬ right now so youll pay no Toll

150â‚¬ +20% Tax  +~10â‚¬ import cost from courier = 190â‚¬

Group Buy
1456$ 10X Photon plus shipping = 1181â‚¬

1181â‚¬ +20%tax +5%toll +~10â‚¬ import cost from courier = 1486 â‚¬  /10 = 147â‚¬ +10â‚¬ shipping Europe =158â‚¬ per piece including shipping/tax/toll/courierimportcosts

So it might be 32â‚¬ cheaper per Piece in Group buy than if you buy it alone, still quite expensive?

??hmm maybe @Wajdi would be up for a 20% discount for a European Group buy of 20 persons ?

But this is just rough estimated, i have no clue how much tax or toll you will really pay. its often verx different for Products, but hardly ever more than 20%tax and 5%toll in my experience

Your calculation is close to the final price I'm aiming for (under 200, preferably around 160). I'll look into customs tomorrow. I'm also in contact with wajdi to arrange a special discount for the groupbuy since this is the first batch. I will update the moment I have news. 
Cheers.

Just a heads up about what happened to me earlier today regarding my Photon order.

Ordered, as back order mid March, and waited patiently, as you do...

Received very little in form of updates/progress during this time, but hey ho put that down to 'small business syndrome' or the like.

Finally got an email ten days ago saying it had been shipped. Tracking number was invalid though so requested further info. Silence. Requested explanation, silence.

Figured the only way to get attention would be via a PayPal Case Opened. I stressed in the text that I still wanted the remote but was unhappy with lack of info. Kept it simple with no inflammatory language.

6 minutes later I get a full refund, but no explanation, no apology, no nothing. Weird.

Don't know what's going on, but at least I have the money back (which I didn't want, I wanted the remote).

All this for info only. Make your own minds up ! ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

I believe they have been shipping to people over the last year, and there's a new info screen (top mount) from same vendor out now as well. I ended up with the Maytech V2 Mini which is solid. I realise now that the Photon was overly gimicky and glad I didn't get it now :-)
