Hi guys. Since I read several issues with low thickness aluminum on motor mounts I decided to send enertion-inspired design to a carbon fiber company (https://xccfrp.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.7803228.0.0.siChwV) and the price they offered was pretty good: 8$/piece shipping included to my house (Italy) if I buy 10 pieces.

NOTE: this price is just for the carbon part, NOT THE ALUMINUM ONE*

For the shipping I will use the company you prefer (consider that non-trackable shipping to europe is 3,5€).
Hope someone is interested.

*I also designed the aluminum part, but good rates (5$ without shipping) start in this case from 100 or more pcs and I don't have time to dispatch 100 shippings.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/7/e75f18cb8945e60e9913f008f90a9d87d9e5efef.JPG" width="690" height="449">
Yes, it does look strange but I did it on purpose: this design doesn't require to thread the holes.

If you look at the company's photos they show enertion motor mount. I asked them if they manufacured this parts in the past and they said yes but they couldnt share the design, therefore I had to design them from scratch. To answer your question: yes the quality is going to be the exact same of enertion's.

Actually it depends on what carbon Weave your use. Not sure what Enertion uses. I'm assuming it is the most tightly Weaved one.

lol I'm not surprised. If you look hard enough you can get each mount for around $10-20 in small quantities (even with screws and anodizing).
This is why I always design my own parts.

This usually leads to acquiring new skills - so yes designing yourself (or at least modifying ) is great.

But sometimes it is nice to just buy (a mount) and focus on other parts ;-).

@fedestanco

Would that company also be open to create that carbon part with (thicker) aluminium? The heat dissipation a full aluminum mount offers is something to not just neglect. Might help with a lot of "high drain" situations (i.e. going up a hill). That is why I personally would not order the enertion mount and rather go with many of the other options out there

I'm sure it can be done. The carbon right now is perfect at 5mm thick. Not sure how thick other mounts are.

@Pantologist

The nice part about carbon fiber is, that it has less weight than aluminium. The downside though is, that heat stays trapped at the motor.

Check [this thread on ebuilders](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/thermal-images-after-ride/6634 ) - the thermal images are quite interesting

@fedestanco

On the design, did you already put the pieces together? It looks like that holes for the splint of the motor plate on the hangar mounting clamp are to close to the axle. (Which would result in the mounting plate "hitting" the axle) - but it might just the perspective

```
All the designs fit perfectly since I assembled them on adobe inventor.
Carbon fiber thickness is 5mm (as enertion's).
The aluminum part (2nd drawing) is designed to be 15mm, but if you choose a strong alloy like 7075 I believe 10mm will be enough. I am sorry to offer just half of the mount but If you buy less than 100pcs you will pay at least 15$ just for the aluminum.
Anyhow THIS IS A GROUP BUY so please hands up ✋ if you are interested.
Please let me know if you need further info.

You guys are free to help me find a better deal on the internet.  Just search custom cut aluminum on alibaba and send the request (I will post the drawings later). I wasn t too concerned with the aluminum part since it is crazy easy to make at home and super cheap (5$ if you pick up the best alloy).

OK guys I am glad that this group buy is having a bit of success. Let me organize things a bit better:

What I wanted to do untill few minutes ago :make 10pcs group buy JUST FOR THE CARBON PART to save a bit of shipping fee

BUT since many people are interested in buying also the aluminum part this group buy could drift to another direction-----1 PROBLEM: aluminum manufacturing cost for small quantities (the only company I contacted offered 5$/piece-no shipping- if I buy 100pcs or more, BUT for a quantity they consider "sample", the price will be 15$)

This is what I am going to do: ask few more companies whether they could let us pay a reasonable price (5-10$) for 10pcs. Otherwise I WILL GO JUST WITH THE CARBON PART and I will manage this group buy just form me and THE FIRST 10 COMMENTERS OF THIS TOPIC.

The rank for this group buy is:

@awcrusius
@karma 
@michaeld33
@mishrasubhransu (would you be in also without the aluminum part?)*
@OHS  (would you be in also without the aluminum part?)*
@Dunmer  (would you be in also without the aluminum part?)*
@Blacksheep  (would you be in also without the aluminum part?)*
@abenny  (would you be in also without the aluminum part?)*
@barajabali  (would you be in also without the aluminum part?)

I sincerely hope to find a good deal for the aluminum in less than 3/4 days, but if I won't be lucky I ask the * guy to stay in or leave BECAUSE I WILL PROCEED with the only-carbon group.

Thank you for the patience.
PS shipping info in chat-----product info in the forum

Hi guys, I am waiting for 2 invoices from China. In the meanwhile please start choosing the shipping company and sending me the link/name of the service so that I will tell you exactly how much you will have to send by paypal (please consider grouping to save on the shipping/ to save my time).

Here are 2 things I didn t mention but they are pretty obvious: 1)if you pick untrackable shipping and the parcel gets lost you are protected from nobody (never happened to me but I heard stories on the internet)
2) I will not send nuts/bolts since the can be found in any hardware store and they increase shipping weight. I will tell you what to buy anyway.

BTW I am not selling the items, I am just disptaching them and I will pay the same amount you pay (maybe few cents less due to approximation).

I wouldn't do it with 10mm. The screw holes get way too close to the edge of the mount. Unless you make the screws smaller.

I use 10mm and seems ok at the moment but would say a little thicker would have been better. But I have been thinking about this and I think for my next mount I make I will use threaded rod and red locktite the rod into the larger side of the mount and then use locking nuts and blue locktite on the clamp meaning that the thinner threads on say a 5 or 6 MM stud wouldn't be under as much stress or usage.

If there is a group buy, and one mount costs maximum 30€, I would take two complete with aluminium(Do you live in the EU?).
I think the most ppl just want a complete  mount. So i think the best way to handle this is to make 100 Complete mounts, make them cheap but with a little bit of profit and sell this 100 pieces first. If you like to sell them make more.

One day everyone will have this mount because of the price (With Enertion Quality).

OK guy we finally have a deal: a bit less than 13$ for 12mm 5052 alloy----or 14$ 7075 alloy. I'd personally go with 7075 since it is much stronger. Price includes shipping to my house and customs to europe.
The seller told me in advance that we are going to have rough edges since we decided for the 12mm.

(I believe it is not that bad since this photo refers to carbon-steel. In addition, The mount is going to have more grip on the trucks)

SO PLEASE UPDATE ME IN CHAT 1)HOW MANY PCS     2)SHIPPING TO YOUR HOUSE (poste trackable/ poste untrackable/ dhl/ ups/...........)

Then I will tell you how much to transfer on my paypal. I guess family/friend transfer is just fine for group buys.

To make it more clear: weight of the mount is 100 grams and the weight of the box is between 20 and 50. So a total of 120-150 grams each mount.

Option number 3 is a fast shipping to europe and includes the freight of a 1kg box.

Hey guys I just 3d printed the mount and gave it a test fit. It looks very good and is surprisingly sturdy even with plastic. I'm using random hardware I found lying around and didn't tighten anything too much to avoid cracking the plastic but it looks like things line up very well.

Assembly tip: the parts are coming with no further finish after the laser cut. For this reason it is possible that some bolts wont slide fluid into the hole at the first try. I suggest you not to go with a smaller bolt but TO CLEAN THE HOLE: for example use a 6mm drill bit to clean 6mm holes.

Im just here to send my compliments to fedestanco! This thread is an eye-opener, i didnt think it would be possible to have these parts made for so little because I automatically assumed it required milling for the out-of-plane clamping holes. Turns out they just laser or water cut the whole thing in mass, and then somebody with a 2$ hourly wage puts them under the drill press to make the 4 holes that are out of plane. No thread cutting required either. I think the CF parts are water cut too so thats easy as well, and the geometry of the plate allows for minimal material waste.

I still need to get started on my first build, which will be mostly from ready made parts, but after I gained some experience I might also get into fabricating my own stuff!

Yes they are. You will figure out by yourself that when one hole is positioned 0.01 mm differently the fitting will not be as nice as is the case you pair it with its original mate. I used to pair the original mates with tape to avoid you this hassle.

Hi guys.  Few days ago enertion contacted me and told me to avoid producing in large scale something that has been designed starting from their open source mount. I would be happy to do another group buy but before moving in that direction I will have to start a new design from scratch (taking dimensions by my own). Once it will be finished I would like to handle the whole thing and I would like to add 1-2$/mount of profit for myself (I will try to find cheaper factories to let the price ramain 22$).

If you are interested helping me prototyping with a 3d printer please contact me in chat.

Oh ok will i suggest we do a even bigger group buy this time with your/someones elses design which will reduce the cost for everyone else.

Well there will have to be guidelines to that.

For example is selling a drivetrain with your motor mount not allowed to make 2$ profit.

I think as a community we shouldnt sell the mount singularly for more than the X amount that your selling it for. 

Since other companies are charging 60$ for the same item its not fair the customer either

But if it the cheapest alternative....Why not pay a little extra for the time and effort....and still get it cheaper than any place....

The thing with a group buy is that one person does all the leg work but everyone else gets to wait for mail ... 

Everyone's stuff comes in one box...gotta sort through it...check the list...re pack everything...make or write mailing labels ... huff all that shit to the post office....

Time is money for some people...and that effort should be rewarded especially if they are getting you things cheaper than any place else.

The motor mount you made is very similar to Enertion's not only from a mechanical point of view, but also in terms of design/looks, so I understand why you were asked not to make them on a large scale. 

It should be fairly easy to design your own mount, it is also perfectly acceptable if it is very similar in terms of how it works, usually one key differentiator is enough.

Im a mechanical engineering student and I think the mounts can still be made much better. There are some really fancy mounts out there, but they also cost a lot to manufacture due to increased complexity. Maybe after exams I might design my own and see if you guys like it.

Also, if you organise a group buy I think its perfectly normal if you make some money from it. Its a lot of work, and as long as youre being honest about it, its all good.

I would be glad to do it. I have my own designs that work really well. As for upping the price, I cannot agree more with @Michaelinvegas if I do the mount gb, I would do it for minimal markup. But I would also like to sell a drivetrain along with it, which I will mark up a bit (you would still be getting a much better deal than say DIY).

Might be worth designing a mount like the torqueboards with an insert for different tricks but obviously start with calibre first as you have the dimensions.

As haven't seen one like this with carbon plate and think would be really nice I would pay a little more to have something like this. Also if you wanted to make some money on them it's best to have a wider market of different trucks.

I think you could make it thinner definitely but it's how to keep the strength in the threads. But I have worked with aluminium and then use steel key inserts to help the threads stay intact but would this make it thicker again. But something would have to try. Wish I had easy access to a Cnc machine to test it out.

These are what I have used before if you thread lock them in then tap the pins they will never come out. And if you get the right size should be able to get enough clamping force to do a good tb style with one bolt with out the worrying of stripping threads. And could lazer cut it then tap out the threads out for these.

There are some thin parts near the holes, maybe you can improve the design little bit to fix that :)

There is a closer look at what I mean:

Actually there is few alu right there because that wall just has to function to keep the bolt in place. None of the clamping force will be focused on that thin wall. Anyways next time I can make it 1mm thicker and it will look cooler.:sunglasses:

Im starting to fall behind with my 3d printed mounts and right now I dont want to buy another printer so it would be a win win.

Carbon parts can be made for 8$ aswell. I am still waiting on the aluminum part which will be black anodized and around 10-15$ I assume. Hardware(all screws, nuts and washers)will be 2$.

Good luck with the GB. Just a reminder: unfortunatelly it is not possible to use my files to do that since they are way to similar to enertion's.  If you have your own design, feel free to put them into production.

Also take care what alu you´re going to take. Last time was a 7075 alloy. 
If you take a softer one it may deform after a few miles of riding, so keep that in mind!

They will be 7075 hard anodized aluminum. The design  is very similar to yours. But you cannot put a copyright on measurements as it is not a 1to1 copy there is nothing telling me I cannot make these. Also no trademark is being mentioned.

As an engineer I assure you since I am not selling branded  enertion motor mounts. Or 1 to 1 copies everything is fine. I worked for a manufacturer of composite aircraft parts in Luxembourg and when our designs were copied and altered we could only hope that our quality  would retain our customers (wich it did most of the time).

the weak spot are the two screws which hold the two axle parts together, they bend a bit, so I had to replace both screws.
So choose strong screws and nuts for them!

I would have created a new topic for this so people dont get confused but I cant.
So everything is sorted.
Carbon 3k twill 5mm thick 8$
Aluminum 7075 black hard anodized 12$
Screws, nuts and washers  Metric rated 12.9 standard is 8.8  2$.
All together 22$ plus shipping in U.S. 6$ in Europe 9$. Packages  in Europe will be shipped via dhl maxibrief from Germany.

could you make a mount that is more universal and does fit more trucks than just calibers?
There is huge interest for a Ronin mount and with whitepony's tutorial a round clamp would already help quite a lot.
Right now only the alien mount can be used.

@jdyer8989 I'm not sure, I wanna give it a week or 2  before I order so word can spread. After that it will take 15days to make and 2 weeks to ship wich I dont trust 100% after that  a week to you I assume and an additional  week for everyone in Europe.

An other design thing:
The last design had the issue of caliber tolerance. They where loose a bit on 2 trucks while they snug fit on other caliber.
The solution is to file down a bit of the inside of each clamp part, so that they are able to come closer together and fit every caliber (they are really different in hanger thickness from batch to batch).

So bring down the thickness of each side by 1mm and we´re all good without filing down something :slight_smile:

This is Off-topic but as a universal mount I designed these and then would have the right ring made for each truck.

BTW try something different than a circle to reduce to 0 the chances of slipping.

Laser cutter wont have problems performing a "tight turn" like that one. Consider that problably somebody will cnc the clamp at home and a 2mm detail like that may cause some problems.

Got my mounts today.

Quality looks pretty good.  CF seems nice and thick/beefy.

My only gripe is the hardware supplied is not correct.  @Shogu12 maybe you can help me understand what is going on here:

[img]https://goo.gl/PhWZVq[/img]

The carriage head bolts are too small and rotate freely (kinda defeats the purpose):
[img]https://goo.gl/Ygn1p8[/img]

I can run to the hardware store and grab some that are correct and snug - while i'm at it i'll get nylock nuts.

For the price i shouldn't complain, but the hardware seems sub-par even for only 2$.

I'd have liked to seen one long stainless bolt (bottom bolt), and one shorter stainless bolt (top bolt), or even threading into the bottom of mount to avoid the necessary nut (also not nylock - so use loctite folks).
[img]https://goo.gl/4DS8YA[/img]


I'm glad to have them and all easily fixed issues if you have spare hardware kicking about.  I have just about everything except the carriage bolts that will fit properly into the CF (otherwise it spins and you cannot tighten - defeats the purpose!).
