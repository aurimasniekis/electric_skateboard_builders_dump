I think they sell some connections on the flipsky website but I'd definitely be willing to send you a few bucks for the connections! Moving out to a place where I won't have easy access to a solder iron so this would be a life saver!

it was less as i was asking for people to pay using "friends and family" uninsured payment on paypal, which has no fees, but the overseers here told me I coudnt encourage "friends and family" payment as its not insured and against policy on esk8 site.  so had to raise the price assuming people will pay me using "goods and services" payment.  It adds 2.9 percent fee to what i get.  And got frustrated doing it for so cheap before at that low original price i made about a dollar each.  it does take some time and wasnt worth it.

Yeah I've seen that.  Been trying to resist that one since I ordered 2 FOCBOX unity's.  This one would be a good stop gap vesc to use until my unity and my son's unity shows up.  We're both using generic boards from ebay.  Not very good but they do the job.

I've always purchased things that most would consider top of the line, cutting edge or new to market and are feature rich.  While I know this may spark an argument with some people and the unity may not be the top of the food chain it intrigues me and I want to try it out.  As for my son no he doesn't go that fast nor do I.  He's maybe 165lbs or 75kg.  I on the other hand am a big boy and weigh in at 240lbs or 109kg.

I haven't found reviews on the Flipsky dual ESC yet, just a couple of user saying it's OK but nothing definite so I'm buying too to test them myself. 

If anyone has already installed it and had used it with high current setting, please share your thoughts

I got mine in yesterday, for testing.  I soldered the bullets on the phase wires and an xt90 on the power leads.  It came with sensor cables, which was cool.  I just upgraded the firmware to Ack's 3.102.  I'm going to swap it into my test board later today and test it tonight.  I'll let you know how it goes.

I hooked mine up to a premade board, 40A 10S worked flawless as well.

Seems like decent quality, especially when it costs the same as one vesc 4.12 or what they used to go for.

Still need to tweak some settings to keep it from cutting out on me

Im getting cut outs as well, on startup mostly.  What do you suggest changing?  The battery max?

I get cutouts on startup and braking. IF i jam the throttle it cuts out, if i jam the brake without easing into it it cuts out. 

I tried PWM tweaking, tried messing with the throttle curves, tried lowing my motor min and bat min, pretty much everything I can think of so far. I'm certain though that if i stare at it long enough while gradually becoming drunk enough that the answer will come to me. 

to be fair, this is probably the first time i've really dug into VESC-Tool other than just toying with it for a few minutes. Firmware on the ESC is 3.40 allegedly.

Yeah, I'm getting the same thing.  I got terrible results with the stock firmware so I upgraded to Acks 3.102 and its better, but still cuts out at quick acceleration or breaks.  I've got a pretty generous throttle curve setup at -20%/-20%.  I'm running 50/-40/50/-20.  The brakes are really soft, so I think Ill bump it to -40.  Not sure what to do about the cutouts.

 @BarbaraZ  what you think? maybe we should stick to the 6.6 how's it doing?   I know @evoheyax is running one on his bike with a hub hub motor and delivering around the city and doing huge miles and he was recently trying to describe the awesomeness of 120motor amps.  and then when he was likely doing his longest sustained uphill i think it was 3000 watts for a while and something happened.  and it shut off and since then he's backed the motor and battery amps down.   he did have one that fried right out of the bag pretty much, unexplained, but with another running foc and i bet he's riding 8 hours a day.  couldnt be a harder test.

It happens every time on full acceleration and braking with a drv8302 error but as soon as you let go of the trigger you can use it again. 
I ran it in FOC. 

If you click on the Metr logo you can check it in a browser if that helps. There are other options too on the data if you click on the values and so on.

Yes, we have received the same problems from our customers these days. So we have done some tests and found that the 4.20 works normally with 10S battery. Therefore, before we figure out a solution, we would like to suggest that you run the board with 10S battery.

Make sure you order LOW ESR caps but extra capacitance doesn't hurt in my opinion.

Just paste the url in and let the magic happen. 

Here is another short test on 30amps. I didn’t have any drv8302 error this time.

I will try a longer ride next time on the same settings. I think this one is safe.

There's a number of upgrades that chaka came up with that increase 12s foc stability. Only a few people adopted them and most (including vedder) rejected them. I can tell you, chaka 4.12's are super reliable. Everything else I tried, not so much. The v6 fixes a lot of these issues so now it's just a question of how well are these made in my mind...

[quote="Kug3lis, post:172, topic:65517, full:true"]
Here comes lack of capacitance to provide that quick extra power needed for that tap down acceleration :)
[/quote]

So is this cutout thing a common issue for all 4.12’s, or it’s only limited to this FS dual vesc?

This cutout problem is new to the FS 4.12.

I was talking about overall reliability/stability. The 4.12 overall is not stable (even vedder has admitted this) and breaks under certain conditions (generally speaking, 12s FOC). Vedder increased reliability with the vesc 6. For under $250, you could have 2x 6.6's so while yes, a bit more money, it's a completely different beast when it comes to dealing with heat also...

the US group buy can / should ship to canada at slightly higher shipping prices.

@Hummie has the order been put in?

i wanna use these on my next build...

They’re in the mail. 

 I’ll do another group buy for these tomorrow and do Canada too. It’ll be quick and there’s a lot of people who want them so will send it in in like a day or two.  6.6s as well

So what about the 3 over voltage events? Looks like its triggered over 50v, there is one peak on the fist one of 56.3 volts :open_mouth:  

I would guess the cause is not enough capacitance or something wrong with your battery.  

Any electrical engineers have any ideas?

I always get over voltage fault when going full brakes on a full battery. 

There might be something up with my battery though. I seem to get a lot of sag on full acceleration which has triggered under voltage fault before. Still need to open up my pack properly and check it.

You know that was my thought about not enough capacitance.  I'm going to get a few low ESR caps either rated for 63v or or than likely 100v caps and put them in line.

and I have @emancarrillo here I missed in my bag. will go now with....  and @Wraith to 6.6s
@Tamatoa one 6.6 as well
labels for @luv2sk8te17
Christopher Karg in Canada
@mmaner with deck 
@Ckarg with a single 6.6 to canada 

that’s the good news. but it was slow coming and people from the second group buy are asking for theirs thinking it would be here and its not. I got a bunch of 6.6s and not any extra of the dual when I compiled the first buy because theyre showing more reliable than the 4.2. if you are on the list for the second dual group buy take them for 230$ a pair. please. this group buy stuff takes too much of my time and need to be working on other things. I really just wanted people to get them so we could see how they perform.

Is there an accessible list where in your GB's my place is? All this time I thought you were waiting for shipment for 4.2 dual, but it appears the most recent shipment was for 6.6. A little clarity on situation and how long of an wait would be greatly appreciated!

I just sent out the first dual group buy and the second 6.6 group buy.

Im sure its confusing and im confused.  how about anyone who was on the second group buy for the 4.2 dual take a pair of the 6.6s I got for 230$ including shipping tracking insurance.
?
