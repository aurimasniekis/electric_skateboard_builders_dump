Hi all ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ !

I know some people were interested into a group buy for Canadians. I can eventually organize it if there's enough people interested.

The parts available and prices (USD) are there:

Please comment here with what you want, so I can evaluate the interest and eventually go to further.

Hi guys, got the message. I'll confirm before ordering. Not sure when that will happen though, I'd like to get more people in.


Any canadians interested out there ?
