**usa group buy only.  there's another for EU and i think another for Asia.**

we are getting the one above including the heatsink but NOT with the switch.  you have to find your own switch.  (i'll post up when sure but think it must be a 24v or possibly a 12v)

i'll see what they say tonight and actually do the math of this since i wont really be doing anything but sending on, (i wouldnt be involved in a warranty claim ill have to check), but ill add up the costs.  i dont know if they'd be upset if i tell the price but lets call it early 90s$ so thinking what expenses and shipping costs will be and im happy to do it for 5$ each.  but they might have upped the price and not even sure on shipping cost...hold on.  but if you want to get one ok or pick them up no charge.

eu is more work but id do it for 10$.  but still speculating on the price but they see me as a seller of things, which i do, so they offered me these bulk prices.   I'll tell you tonight and i just bought 2 earlier today and will be included hopefully but i think we can hit 20 bought tonight!.   i'll throw in tootsie rolls and other better bits for sure as this is easy and i feel a rip off selling for profit even on these.

Would shipping it with your wood and CF decks lower shipping costs? Just guessing as I'm unsure how it works when shipping to Asia. Now that is a sweet price point at $90 if it does go through!

they got back to me and with shipping to me and paypal 5% to them it's just under 100$ each to them and I imagine i can put them in one of these boxes which cost 7.20$ and i'll add padding and something worth a couple bucks you'll want.
https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm 

so 115$ each including two day domestic shipping which comes with a tracking.  

if you pick it up its 100$ each

please paypal to humminashadeeba@gmail.com  friends and family or its another 5$, and be sure to add your real name and address as well as your username here on there and will work easier.
this is just domestic shipping and rather not do international at this point because everybody's cost will be different and there's a lot of paperwork.    but if you pm me and we figure it out i could ship it international

im supposed to be going away for two weeks and I'm sure they will be here by the time Im back.

doing a bank transfer their fee is 18 and bankofamerica is 45.  and the cost for 20 of them is 1905$  (no switch).  and shipping cost for me is call it 8$ and the post office charge is 7.20$.  so total cost to me is..98.15$.  (seems no point using paypal and i imagine we're pretty insured).  
then with shipping cost domestic two day insured is 106.15 total.  I said id do it for 5$ each so **selling them for 111.11$!**

paypal friend and fam to humminashadeeba@gmail.com or add 6 bucks more to me to do the transfer regular insured.

The focbox is a little smoother, but i get better acceleration and power from flipsky. i was going to preorder a unity but i am thinking 2 x flipsky or the new dual model

Talk here.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-flipsky-esc6-6-group-buy/63924/1

Pricing will be similar but it will be higher because of extra currency conversions, import tax, and paypal fees. Those details will obviously be set in stone before I ask for any money

ordered.  too impatient to wait and did paypal.  bit safer.

 i think have 4 extra but this went so fast we can get to another 20 in days if people are interested

so lets keep it rolling and if you paypal me the 111.11  (friends and fam payment or an extra 5$ cost)  I'll put in another order as soon as we hit 20 again.  I think that will be in like two days as i know a bunch of other people are still going to do this still.

you can read a breakdown of the costs above and i make 5$ off each of these for my time.

be sure to add your user name here and real name and address on the paypal form.  

I'll post here when they arrive and we can confirm the details then.

yup.  but you'd have to give me a lot extra up front and then i'd return whatever was left after paying for shipping and 5$.  i mean this for anyone interested in out of usa shipping.  makes it easier as i dont have to go to the post office twice.  


what you think of using this switch!?  looks awesome and price is right.  we are not getting switches with these im ordering.  find your own.  syched it has this internal fet switch on the pcb

Yeah, I use dual VESC 6 on my board, it's another level, this is for and ebike project that I'm working, using a 6355 motor and a really small battery 10S2P or even 10S1P to keep it really compact

Hi Hummie

Thanks - Yes I can add a bit on to cover shipping, a quick look online suggests you are about right on shipping, between 10 to 20 USD.

So shall I pay now to get in on this group buy? Do you have some spare? Or will I need to wait for the next one?

Thanks

Sam

I just wanted to chime in again  here. We had a pair of these sent to us to eval. They felt great, great breaking, great acceleration, very polished feel. They lasted about a week before one of them had a switch failure. 

I contacted barbera at  flipsky and let them know what happened, explained the blink codes, etc. They are sending us free replacements and are also sending us a dual ESC to try out. Apparently there is a known issue with the power switches and/or circuits behind them. 

they seem to be serious about creating a solid solution.

I wouldn't expect them to give away too many design or fix details, people usually don't unless they're trying to market themselves rather than their product.  These guys seem to be driving a different kind of hard sell. 

hitting up builders and begging them for feedback... like literally every day... on devices they send out for review for free means they are serious. I would expect them to either fix or have already fixed it. There have been times where i was like "look, the motherfucker doesn't fit in my boards, i'll let you know when we build a go cart or something..." but they kept at it so @Jayx  ended up with them on his giant surfboard sized rig so we could break them and send feedback. He just bolted them on top side because that's the only place they could go.

Okay that puts me at ease knowing that they just aren't trying to shove some vesc that will just fall short of expectation when already in running builds.

Good to know that you've been thoroughly stress testing these, I'd expect similar customer service once these actually start getting to peoples hands from the group buy.

im not sure i understand your question but these have a fet switch similar to the vesc6 but do require you add a simple switch (24v or i think maybe 12v works) to operate.  i dont know much about them actually and hopefully someone else can explain/confirm.

   please fill it in if youre in the group buy or fill it in if you want one of these and likely get you one of the extras that just arrived or will do another order once we reach the minimum.



im away and will be back to ship them to everyone on wed or thur (forget when my flight is now).

for the 6.6 you can just add your name on the list and i'll have a total of 52 by monday and i have 32 now.  and it looks like there are only 40 showing sold on the form.  so some of you will have to wait till they arrive monday but most I'll give you the tracking tomorrow.
https://goo.gl/forms/ctMWBhklPNl4oc4R2

  I'll get another google doc for the double going tomorrow. 
 the double is 110$ each if we get 20. 
 shipping is 7.20$ 
 there's paypal fee of like 3 percent.  
i'll do the group buy at 125$ each if you pay friends and fam.  that gives me like 5$ each for my packing and shipping and you get tracking and theres some insurance and they come in like two days.
figure it all tomorrow.

Considering that all I ever use are VESC based speed controllers, consider my statement to be in comparison to other VESC based speed controllers. 

between them, so do feel better than others, which is why i'm still using pre-owned VESC-Xs in my older, personal stuff and FocBoxes in my customer builds.

Damn hummie these came fast.

What's everyone doing for firmware? I've been using Ack 2.54 up to now.

Vesc-tool? Is latest 3.39? EDIT 3.40 as of vesc-tool 0.95 which is latest as of today

Ack 3.102?

Leave it stock?

yes the new version is 145mm wide so they will still be a bit too tight though and the escs are 74.5mm wide.  dremel time maybe.  hadnt thought of these when told them the cutout dimensions and none of you guys convinced me to do it wider for this reason!!!  at least with the double hole it's only .5mm to sand for each to fit.

Yes, there are 3 FETS on the top (un-heat sinked side) that appear to be the anti-spark switch FETs.  There is a 3-pin connector that is solder bridged to the on position.  I will de-solder it and test and report if there is an issue.

Ok, the first thing you need to do is take out the 3 screws that hold the heat sink to the PCB, put threadlock on them and put them back in.  They are finger-tight at best and no locking at all.

-- EDIT --
the screws are plastic.  Threadlock isn't going to do much good.  Also, they aren't probably strong enough to hang the thing from the heatsink like I thought they were.  Hmmm.  Needs more brain.

There are 2 holes available in the heat sink which I intend to use to mount these drivers in the box.  So what I'll end up doing is mounting the heat sink to the base, then putting the PCB back on and putting the original screws back in with the above mentioned threadlock.

[/quote]

This is probably a better idea.  I was debating some sort of strain relief on the other side like a block of firm foam.  Still haven't thought this through completely.

If the screws are plastic because they need to be electrically isolated then you'd need to either use longer plastic screws or screw to an isolated enclosure (either plastic or plastic inserts).

My initial impression of the board is ok - they didn't clean the flux off it, I found some solder shards between pins that could cause a short and 2 of the caps have migrated right into each-other and soldered themselves together.  They also used Tantalum caps which have a tendency to explode when mistreated.  I wouldn't use Tants in a drive system but it's entirely possible that the design they based this on used them.

So it might be prudent to give the board a quick once-over.  The board itself looks pretty good - the soldering job is ok.

I'll put it under the scope tonight and see if I see anything else.

if you bought the one that doesnt come with the switch (this groupbuy), the 3 pin connector for the switch is missing and instead theres a solder joining 2 of the 3 pads to permanently turn switch on.  The idea is you can attach your own switch later on if you desire. 

On a dual set up, I would do a Y- splitter and skip a red wire connection on one of the VESC, so the LED only draw power from one of them.

So good news and bad news.  The good news is that properly wired the onboard anti-spark switch does work.  It even works if you double two up on the same switch.

The bad news is that firmware update through VESC tool does not work (at least did not work for me the 5 or so times I tried it).  Interestingly one of my Flipsky's came with 3.38 and the other with 3.40.  I thought updating would be cake, but it wasn't.

I was going to try to program it with my STLink but the pinout is different on this board than the 4.12 so I'll have to wire a new connector.

If someone can check me on flashing from VESC tool that would be great.

Lastly, fair warning, it appears as though they've split the binaries.  3.40 for the 4.12 is not the same as 3.40 for the 60 even though the filename is exactly the same.

Ok, just one more thing - there appears to be firmware out there for hardware 7.5.  Anyone?

I took them out for an embarrassingly short trip - I'm using them on my MTB build with 8" tires, so I took them out to a park that has a giant gravel parking lot and was cruising around the lot when I broke a weld and the whole thing shut down.  

It was only 5 minutes into the  ride, and I didn't go heavy throttle, but they worked fine in the 5 minutes I drove them around.  

I'm working on the board now (as in now that I have the correct thickness of nickle strip for my welder) so with luck will have a better report by the end of the long weekend.

There is 1 weird thing, though.  These boards have anti-spark switches built into them, but I also have a loop key.  When I remove the loop key, wait a few minutes and re-insert it it pops just like if there were no anti-spark switches.  The boards correctly stay off until I switch them on, but it's unexpected to have the loop key spark.

Well it depends.

For those doing without antispark switches, one of the ways to deal with it is to disconnect the pack when not in use. You'd get a big spark here every time unless you used something like XT90S.

If you're using an antispark switch, you leave everything connected, and the capacitors are always charged. The "antispark" part of the name refers to avoiding the big spark from making/breaking the connection, which does not happen if you leave it always connected, and switch via the solid state switch.

Well yes, from a purely EE standpoint it's possible that not having the FETs absorb the inrush current at every startup might make the thing more reliable, but from a purely practical standpoint all of my boards have loop keys (I store them unplugged, seems prudent) and only one of my boards sparks when I plug the loop key in.

I'll look into an XT90S.

For the record, I'm testing the single 6.6 flipsky esc.

I'm feeling good about this thing. Really put it through it's paces. If I ran these in my my eboard, might be able to peak 12000 watts with 4wd. At 3000 watts, the esc does not get very warm. I never have to worry about temps, even at 50a con, it's steady cool.

So the single has an anti-spark and the dual does not have an anti-spark? hmm... I have a dual 6.6 arriving on Wednesday that I'm going to throw in an old deck with raptor 2 hubs and a 10s battery... Hopefully it does ok on these SF roads and I don't die...

raptor hubs in sf.   hopefully you can meet up and we can race up twin peaks and compare sometime  maybe the raptor meetup on the 18th in gg park?    the 6.6 so far hasnt shown any negative responses it seems.

Come out to the BAEsk8 group rides! We ride every Saturday! http://baesk8.club

Also the Enertion event is on the 16th :P 

I'd love to do a Twin Peaks run though! Maybe not a serious race but I do want to see how these "6.6" vescs perform under load...

@sofu I’m not sure your size is considered a load 🤔. Pretty sure all those Chinese board’s great specs are based off people your size.

@hummie is that group buy over? Would you consider shipping outside of the US? I am not in Europe and USA is definitely closer to me. 
I was looking at focboxes but those are actually cheaper.

@Tamatoa you can get in on it.  tomorrow night is the final night.  just sign up.   in fact i think we need more people and everyone is in the flipsky dual 4.2.   if you want to do foc, which is definitely worth doing, id go with these.

All good. I’ll Send to them midnight west coast time if u want in the group but get it to me and on the form by then. Don’t know if enough of the 6.6 orders to do it so unfortunately while there’s a bunch of the dual 4.2 wanted from flipsky not many 6.6. 
Batteries are pretty reliable if made well for a boards environment. Motors can be really reliable. The esc I’d rather run the 6.6.  Runs cooler besides. N the get switch I haven’t heard of breaking   Dare I say yet.  
I don’t know dink about what components on these pcbs and what changes bedder made going to the 6, or what’s on this board but doesn’t matter if it’s shown good so far. 4.2 I wouldn’t mess with n it’s cutout questionably.  Questionableness if u like. 
I’m hyped on the 6.6 so far.  Soon to put it together. On the bus home back to make motors n then when done make board.

We are testing them under a lot of load - non standard application. So far, no problem at all. Seem to be good. Cheers

The two 6.6s that supposedly broke healed themselves!🤪. So so far they seem to have a 100% success rate until someone says something negative.

Has anyone come up with a 3D printed enclosure or mount for these yet? Seems kinda tricky to mount it right with the heatsink. I might design something this weekend.

I'll be designing something that will go with the deck I sell.   Planning to have a abs print bolt to the deck and then have the 6.6s bolt to the print.
