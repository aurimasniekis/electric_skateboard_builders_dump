Hi,

I have been looking to get Kegel pulleys machined and I thought I could maybe run a group buy if there was any interest. Hoping to get at least 10-15 pullies in this group buy.

Fits Oranatang Kegels 
6061 Aluminum
Sandblasted
Black Anodising 

![DIY Electric Skateboard KEGEL 36T 12mm HTD5 Wheel Pulley v2|690x346](upload://gi4wicvZaoHZwjG4duXxdA8T1K7.jpg)

Approximate pricing so far is 23 euros/piece - that includes shipping to me and tax on top. Thats just for the Kegel pulley and a 3D printed retainer cap. I can get a quote for a retainer cap to be machined to be made. 

If there is interest but people don't like the design we can make a pulley which looks like this for probably a couple more euros more

I think I will need to do some research about that first. If I remember correctly @captainjez said that Boa wheels can replace the boosted board kegels without any modification.

I will research around for popocas though. I really hope they do :slight_smile:

Our wheels are offset the same as the Kegel. The Popoca are centre set so they need some tweaks.

I've got the BKB (@JLabs) Kegel pulleys in a set of popacs, perfect in every way.

I will look further into it and get back to you

Kind of forgot about the thread. I will bump it in ib the morning and see if there's interest because this is a EU group buy and it's late :slight_smile:

Yes, I can ship them tho and it wonâ€™t be that expensive. I may also be able to get them drop shipped from China as well.
