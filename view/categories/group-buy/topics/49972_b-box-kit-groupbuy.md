This is the group buy for the B-Box/ Hw6.4 kit it includes.
PCB, SMD (no nrf), 1 x xt90 power cable, 1 aluminum heat sink and silicone heat transfer pad + screws.
The enclosure for the box doesn't quite fit the cover PCB but if you want it its an extra 5$ and includes said cover.

The kit will cost 105$+ any paypal fees and shipping. This price is almost at cost for everything.
The heat sink has 4 holes making it ideal to mount.
SMD only kits are 80$

Mouser and arrow are both very fast and reliable when it comes to shipping so 7 days after the last person pays I will ship to you.

Ok cool, I so badly want to get 3 of these but I don’t trust myself to try and solder the whole board together (very little experience in smd). I might buy some later on after I practise on some dummy vescs. 

I think you should continue to sell these kits even after the gb, it give people with smd experience a cheaper alternative and it could also be a learning experience for others with less experience. 

Anyway great job on this project they look great

Just so I understand it correct, this is not a ready to run vEsc correct? You need to acquire and then Solder on all the components to the pcb yourself?

I have a fair bit of soldering experience, but not with an air reflow. would you recommend an air reflow station for this kind of work? Itd be better quality than using a tip.

My only concerns are in the possibility of the components being faulty, however thats less likely than me making an abortion of the assembly process :sweat_smile:

So down for this but I dont have a laser cutter for the stencil :frowning:. Might have to go out of my way to use one in my college maker space. Anyways if anyone in the bay are interested I have access to a reflow oven in my club room. Havent tried double sided reflow tho. I should just need to elevate it when i place smd and in the oven.

Omg these are so well priced in tempted to buy a bunch with the knowledge that I must likely will mess one up but if I can do it this is an incredible deal!  About how long does it take to complete a single unit? Is uploading VESC 6 Software to this pretty easy/straightforward?

Last thing, I noticed both you and Stewii omitted the motion sensor chip and the wireless nRF.  Were those kinda unnecessary things, or what was /is the reason for that?

Yeah NRF is because FCC regulations don't want anyone going to jail lol
I can make one in about 2 hrs with stencils .
Flashing the firmare is connection a st-link find the .bin file and hitting start.

Well, People don't like dealing with customs so If someone Buys it from US imports it and then from The Eu sends it to him He can relax and avoid phone calls to customs.

And I think the written value is lower if it's just a kit not prebuilt so lower import tax.
And If someone like @banjaxxed wants to buy 4 maybe he could get another 2 for @stormboard1

You're on the wrong thread son, EU is going up here,organised by @stewii 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/escape-group-buy-professional-pcb-assembly/49720

If you don't like the £160 price then remember -
@bimmer kit while it's a nice low-cost solution derivative ofStewii's, it's going to take someone with time, tools & probably a stencil on their hands to make it, the housing on the @stewii kits are a full cnc'd housing. Apart from that just a different colour pcb cover/logo.

Of course shipping from the USA and imports does come into it as well, if you ask me & you did, the Stweii pro-built ESC is what you really want instead of trying to save €20-€30 in the wrong place (if post is cheap and customs doesn't kick in)....and the labour which is never free or you don't really want it lemmetellyou

Which 3d printer are you using and what setting and orientation are you printing your enclosures?
If I would guess you are using a brim and having the top surface on the bed.

Am I asking too much if I want the enclosure to be printed the other side up? That's gona be more support material but it will give both top surface a better finish. From the picture, I am assuming that  you are printing the top surface on the bed and that's why your lower surface is printed on support and not as smooth.

Alternatively, if that's too much for you, can I get the CAD file and print it myself?

Hey  guys I know this is very inconvenient but somehow people sent me their address who were not part of this buy.
Its my fault I didnt make a spreadsheet but now I have people who messaged me emailed me and someone even sent me a text(like how did you get my number nameless person)?
I know I've asked before but I want everyone to receive their parts properly.

Please PM me with your address and when you paid. I will hold your shipment until I have the info. 

And for everyone else unless you got an E-mail that asked you to pay you are not part of the group buy please stop asking I have alot going on right now in my life and would like to get this done as smooth as possible.

@bimmer I haven't received mine either. I'm local so it shouldn't take more than a day or 2 once they're in the mail.

Does anyone have stencils for the PCB or knows where I can order them cheap? The cheapest offer I found was something for 40USD and this for the Kapton Version and not steel/aluminium version!.

Would be thankful if someone could offer them or lead me in the right direction where to get them cheap.

Thanks in advance
