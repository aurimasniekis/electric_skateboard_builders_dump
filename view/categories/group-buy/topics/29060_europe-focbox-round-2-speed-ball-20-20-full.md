Hello ladies and Gents,

I have been running around getting ready to ship and have noticed a few mistakes. As all of you have paid, and I want all of you to get your FOCBOX after this first initial shipping, I have made a spreadsheet with your Forum name, last names, country of destination, Order, and a tracking number

 - Go to the 2nd sheet at the bottom of the page marked Group Buy #2

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10mxphAEBKF-l6THcR9KzhcmItzb2EjAxsgV7DgSmcls/edit?usp=sharing

**_Please double check that your forum name aligns with where I am sending these._** 
If you see a problem, or you are moving, get in touch with me via PM. 
If all looks good send a short message of confirmation in this thread.

I know I said I wanted to get these out today but I am going to wait until Monday to be on the safe side.

Thanks gents
```

Sorry boys,
Today agenda is to finish packing, that shit is taking longer than I anticipated and thats with a helper- I will send a photo when task is complete. Tentative plan to ship all except @Riako on Monday. 

I know you all have been waiting eagerly, I'm sorry that this is taking longer than anticipated. As soon as photo will update- tonight or tomorrow.

Thanks for the understanding.
H

thanks for buying location hint. But 140 GBP on street-wing.com vs. 115EUR in case of group buy from Spain. And shipping should cost ca the same in both cases. Significant price difference IMO

The FOCBOXes @ Street Wing are Â£117 before VAT, the tax is what makes them more expensive...

So gents, I was able to do the group buy from the states to avoid import tax/VAT into Europe and shipping from US ( when they were still produced there). I have read a few comments from notable vendors (yummyblobs) that say the pricing is high now and making resales and group buys effectively useless. I will look into these claims and get back to you. If I can I will run another GB when I head home for Xmas for FOCBOXEs in Europe. I am currently slated to head home for Thanksgiving and doing a group buy for Torqueboards long trucks.

More to come.

It makes litteraly no sense. Why it would be more expensive now thatâ€™s itâ€™s built in china ? 

I m very disapointed on this one. Enertion made a bad move IMO.

Esk8.de and Ollinâ€™s VESC are the last TOP NOTCH product I guess

It does suck. If focbox could be had on group buys @ $100 it would be an unbeatable price / performance ratio. They would sell like hotcakes and become the defacto standard.
