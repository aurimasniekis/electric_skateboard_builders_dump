Hello guys! After the first GB since few people asked me about it, would you be interested in another **fast GB to get the MAD hubs**? I thought, better to do it now before summer comes, so you can have the motors in few weeks. After I tried both the options **I suggest the 75Kv** version over the 130Kv, but they are both available. Few links for you to get catch up

**Mad Fury direct drive kit**
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mad-fury-mad-hubs-conversion-to-direct-drive/83423

-**Would you be interested in a pair of MAD hubs?** **10 sets** should be enough to make it worth it and be able to get them for **170 Euro**.
[poll type=regular results=always public=true]
* Yes, I want reserved a set
* No, I am not interested at the moment 
[/poll]

-**Would you want me to include the MAD Fury conversion kit to direct drive as an option?** I should be able to provide it for about **200 Euro**, depends how many people want it.

[poll name=poll2 type=regular results=always public=true]
* Yes
* No
[/poll]

I am really happy with the hubs as direct drive, but if I make it available, I will do that with a slightly different design where you have a strong 12mm axle running across the whole drive. As it is now is fine for me but better to make stronger anyway. Also in this case you will able to come back to the original hub motor configuration. I don't have the final price for them but my target is to get them available for about 200 Euro (including customised truck with 12mm steel axle and motor Pulley of your choice Kegel or ABEC; if the price allows also the motor can in metal otherwise I will share the STL file and you can print them. They get bit up anyway). Then you can assemble your direct drive! I think it's pretty cool. I was really happy when I did mine. 

Let me know!

Little summary...

**Prices**

- 2 Hubs (sleeves included) 180 Euro
- Predrilled Paris clone truck 10 Euro
- Spare PU sleeves 10 Euro each (You need 2 for a dual set)
- MAD fury conversion kit 200 Euro (on top of the motors, only 10 sets)

- **Shipping** to **EU from 15 to 30 Euro** depends where you live (I am in Belgium). To **US 35 Euro**. Possibility to come and pick it up. You would do me a favour!

I will see but I copied a paris truck so should be the same. The central hanger is thicker to host the 12mm axle, maybe that makes you think the angle is different.

Ah well good question never weighted it actually. but really almost the same of the hubs. The additional parts doesn't weight that much, mostly aluminium except the axle. Plus the truck has way less aluminium hanger so almost the same. Is the full skate wheels that add a bit of weight. I will weight it soon. Do not have the hubs assemble to weight them too thought. I think the hubs were around 2.8 - 3kg. Maybe @Andy87 @LukePL @Chase can weight them for us. Thanks guys :smile:

Just to clarify

Are the choices
170 euro for just the hubs

and

200 euro for the hubs including customization to make them direct drive

or is a direct drive setup 170 euro for the hubs & 200 euro for the DD conversion ?

Any chance your willing to release your cad files for the Kegel core adaptors and the hanger ?

Man would be a better world if you can produce all the parts for 30 euro. No 200 is plus the price of the hubs. That's my estimation based on previous price I got, but it really costs a lot. Only if you go to thousands pieces becomes cheaper.
No I am not planning to realise the CAD, honestly too many nights to just let it go. I will already try to make it available at the cheaper price possible. I am not here to make a business but just to get something back to build something else later :smile: The development costs as well. All my projects are pretty transparent and I give plenty of information to people to understand how to do it if they want.

it's written on top. Hubs if we get tot a decent number 170 Euro to my place. The conversion kit I think I can get it available for like 200 Euro more for who is interested. I will make it more clear.

EDIT: Of course if I am wrong in the direct drive kit and it will be less I will lower the price, but pretty sure that is about it.

This is great @rey8801 

What does the thane feel like on the hubs, just your personal opinion? I'm more interested in the hubs right now than the DD from a weight/cost perspective but I've always been put off by hubs because I'm a princess who just loves a comfortable ride.

In my opinion is the most comfortable hubs I have ridden. More than meepo style to understand. It gives a really smooth ride. Now that I am using full skate wheels I only feel the difference with the popoca. Normal clone wheels does not impress me actually. I rode these hubs with the popoca only in front and they do a lot to the ride. Just another level of wheels to me. That's why I am going to use them with my next DD :smile: So if you do not ride off road then the hubs are fine. I would pair them with popoca in front.

Great work on this GB.  @rey8801,  Quick question about the hubs, do you have to modify (shave) the paris hubs in order to get the MAD hubs to fit?

I just need to know if a brotha has to shave shit again.  I am sick of shaving damn trucks.  I swear I read about this before.. but for the life of me I can't remember if you did or not?

Sooooo nice, so tempting, so blown esk8 budget this mth

I'm wondering what would happen if you mounted a 107mm+ wheel, for me now I'm just curious if the factory would be open to making an even lower kv version

Good luck with it!

I aready have the kegel adapter but I could test it with popoca only. I guess most of you want to use it with boa, they have same core that I am sure, but would be nice to test the fit anyway. If someone in EU can send a single boa I will make sure it fits nice. Of course I will cover the shipping cost for the wheels.

No I don't think they will be open to modify the current desing. DUring the previous GB I already asked for changes. We would need to reach way higher numbers or pay by out own. I am using them with 97mm and the torque still crazy at 12s. I guess with 107 would be scary fast.

**So cool !!! Thank you a lot Alessio for this good deal ;)** 
I'm in for a set (75kV) WO truck if possible ... no prob if it's with it as a set.

I say no to the second option of including your Fury adaptor, not that I'm not interested, I want it too, but just because of :money_with_wings: I will need a few months if it will still be possible.

Big Up :v:

Yeh to me will be still pleasant but you will loose the kick they have. Just assumption. At 12s I think they can still be really fun with 107mm wheels. Maybe pushing a bit more amp in there just in case :smile:

the truck is optional, is like 10 euro. Orininal Paris truck will fit, you only need to drill two holes each side to fix the hubs. You can also modify almost whatever truck to fit these hubs. I modified some of them in the past.

Yep one of the guy who got the hubs from the previous batch used the same truck. you will need to modify them on the lathe or file them by end. Did several time for other people. 
thanks to @LukePL for the pic. The collar screws can be replaced with M4 x 6-7mm screws to be flushed with the truck. Do not know why they come with such long M4 screws. I always replace them.

max recommend amp is 50A for hub (motor max). As direct drive, since they run so cool I increased to 60A for the 97mm wheels to get back the kick you have at 90mm. At 90mm wheels with 50A at 12s I challenge you to stay on the board at half throttle. Even at 40kmh (nothing for these hubs, really nothing) if you give throttle you get a huge kick that will throw you off. I was going to print a foot stop to prevent that. Then realised that I do not have enough space on my spud :sweat_smile:

I call DD the conversion kit and hub motor the original layout. So if you mean the hub motors, yes if you sue original Paris truck you only have to drills 2 holes of about 5mm on each side. In the first GB thread  Iposted an how to do guide with all the steps. There I was using a clone Paris truck and I had to shave it a bit, the original Paris fits perfectly. In alternative you cna get the hubs with their truck already drilled.

I remember you had an issue with the braking power with these hubs.  Your recommendation is what for brakes?

-12 to -15 range?

Also -50 max... cool, I will definitely stick with a small battery setup.  I am expecting maybe a 10s2p 30T build to keep this a light weight cruiser.  Although I might go the 10s3p route.  Haven't figured it out yet.

Damn, I am talking about this as if we already ordered the hubs, LOL!

ahahah the braking issue was due to the flipsky 6.6 vesc. It's a known behaviour for the vesc. Now I am using the unity and I have -12A for braking. Really good braking.Of course 75Kv hubs have more braking then the 130Kv. Braking goes with torque.

Ok guys so got reply from the company. The price compare to last summer increased like 30$, because last time got the real first batch and we were like beta tester. Anyhow I used all my skills :smile: (better to say, my stubborn) and I could get almost the same price as last year. So the two hubs to my place without truck would be 180 euro instead of 170. Believe me that they should be 210 from a GB factory price as it is now. Good news that I found better quotation for the shipping cost in EU. So for who is in EU. 90% of the case the total cost will be 195-200 Euro, as it was before. For US folks 210-215 Euro. The total price didn't changed so I think it's fine. I can not ask more. Was really the better price I could get for the amount we are going to order. 
Anyhow I will soon open the Google form. I ask you to fill in all the fields so that I don't have to ask you another time info before shipping. For money transfer would be in $. To pay the company. Thst one can be done with PayPal friends or family, good and service (fees are high, like 15$ on top of the price) or transfer wise. For me all fine. Only condition, if you use good and service I will only ship to the address linked to the account. Read to much annoying stories about it, so I need to follow PayPal rules.
Then a second payment for the shipping in Euro will follow, to regulate eventually extra fees cost for PayPal or I would also like spare sleeves ecc... 
 All the people that partecipate to the GB before can spoke for me. My words stay, so don't worry. You will get what we agreed. I strongly believe in the community and I will never do the same outside, but here I put a lot of trust in people. It can sounds obvious but I prefer to state it clear once at the beginning :grin:

**What you need to know:**

**- 2 hubs (only motors) 180 Euro**

**- spare PU sleeves (10 Euro each)**

**- Predrilled Paris 180mm truck ( 10 Euro)** 

Shipping EU from 15 to 30 (most of the people wiil fit between 15 to 22 euro) 
Shipping US fixed rate 35Euro.

I think it's all. 
I will make the Google form asap. 

Thanks :wink:

Ah forgot. I asked the quotation for the the direct drive kit with two possible options:

- low cost: motor can is 3D printed (I use like that in ABS, since I noticed thst all the direct drive motor can becomes shit after a while and in this motor is just there to cover the screws no structural purpose). So you save the cost of them, I will provide the STL file for it and you can print or I can do it for cheap. Plus the Pulley can be slightly simpler, so will cost less. 
- full metal kit. All the parts machined in metal. 

I also asked central truck and metal can anodized or powder coated in black. If we do it, we do it right :wink:

I really like them despite the DD solution.

I asked the company whether they changed the PU sleeve based of our comments during the last GB. Basically only in one case, I think also due to a wrong winding for which they send a new stator in replacement, the metal screws digged inside the PU sleeve once they were really hot. We suggested to make a different central core but still now they have sold several drive trains and that was the only case. Anyhow they provide STL files for an insert to add in top of the screws (ABS is good for printing) to make a really thight fit that helps in preventing it. I have used quite extensively and so all the others and we didn't have problem. Anyhow you can find it in the first GB thread. I will ask people to print these little inserts by themselves, otherwise I will help too :wink:

Sorry I am not following :sweat_smile:

For the Kv those are fixed I asked the factory to modify them I am fighting to bring them lower for who wants to use them with big 107mm wheels. They already said 60Kv it is not possible for the winding. I will try 65-70Kv but I can tell you that 90% of the case won't happen.

Ho ok, thank Alessio ! Good to know.
Next step here is to make also the motor one day :upside_down_face: !

Do you think milling a 100mm worth it ?


Ho also, about the sleeve :

> Spare PU sleeve? How many units (1 unit equal 1 PU sleeve, 10 Euro, specify amount)

that is for extra sleeve ?

Ahahah got it. I put the different options because some asked for that. 
Anyhow I am making from scratch the DD with the MAD Storm but will take some time and costs also more, there the KV can be decided.. These are nice hubs, strong, that were on the market for 2 times the price you are taking them now. With the DD kit will give a cheap DD experience but don't get me wrong the quality is there. It's just the price low because I want to make it like that. I really like ride them every day and want to give the opportunity to others to try them out :grin:

Yes the sleeve are extra. The hubs come with one installed.

Didn't understand what yuo mean with drilling 100mm

[spoiler](Like I told you, I'm exactly in the same tough about hub motor, I fall in love for the free wheel and riding experience (if you also push) and overall look more closer to classic esk8 !
Riding with the cut off start are really not bad, and it's a great help somethime ^^ )[/spoiler]

It's more of a question that intrigued me, but : 
Do you think I could machine a 100mm wheel (like the boa, or 97mm FW) to replacement the actual 90mm sleeve, just to get more comfort (assuming I can't get the DD Furry fast enough... based on my economy... but again I ask mostly out of curiosity, I know that some have already done - just want your fov Alessio ;) ) ?

Ok so the company received the parts lists for the DD kit. They will let me know the cost of the low cost design and the high cost one as specified before.

Here two picture so that you can see how the final product would be. Simple to keep lower the cost, but still sick to me :smile:

97mm wheels

Depends how fast people confirm. Based in my experience the reason why GB takes longer is not the delivery time or production. 60% of the leading time is due to people not confirming in time. Then when the GB is closed everyone shows up and they want to join :joy: I should make fake dead line... :smile:
I am also asking around for kegel core wheels. I found them but MOQ is 1000 units ahahaba

I will. Anyhow for who is interested in DD and big wheels the company confirmed that they can make a 60Kv version! That's suoe rexcating for me too. One set is mine. Stated clear! I hope the price won't change since the have to do an amendment to make it.
To me up to 97 100mm wheels 75 Kv is plenty. With 97mm you have gmgreat torque and crazy speed. 100mm I guess is the same but the 110 or 5inch pneumatic you will need 60Kv.

**Important update** the guy confirmed that it's possible to make them **60Kv**. That being said they will be the first time ever, same last time for the new locking system and since I am a bit stubborn they agree to make them. To make them 60Kv the winding will be different. So same stator ecc but more loops and less wires for each motor phase wire. The total amount of copper should be similar but we would be the first one testing them. Lower than 60Kv is not possible with this motor. That for who may want run the DD with > 100mm wheels. I have found out that based on the data I have from other people running them and myself, the actual speed becomes really accurate if you use the esk8 calculator with motor efficiency at 100%. Just in case you want to play with it.

It sounds promising! 

So it will be powerful, but we should run it with a bit lower Amps so?
(but on the Mf it should maybe be running at the same Amps than the 75kV like it is cooler in DD configuration ?) it that supposed to be right :sweat_smile: ?

I would love to try with 60kV, but they don't make a new mold with 100mm sleeves ?.. As I don't know when I will have money for the Mf conversion (that I would love to run with 107FW), and I will surely ride this hub under 10s with 90mm wheel for a little (for me) cruiser during until the end of summer ... the 75kv seems to be a nice option middle option, and after all your good and cool feedback, I now 100% confident in you man !

In the other hand, I know I would love to try this 60kV with Bgm ^^ (if I put the efficiency at 80% with 145mm AT wheels, I got around 55kmh ... But it should be AWD for fun I guess :relaxed: ).

Thanks for your work Alessio !
I stay with the original **Mad Hub motors 75kV** (without trucks)

 But after reading you, and seeing all this great build/cruiser/ little commuter, that remember me the feeling I got on my [SWE board](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/swe-custom-33-integrated-enclosure-ronin-cast-modified-hub-motor-80kv-800w-90mm-10s5ah-x2-vescs/13412/43), I really would like a sweet street hub cruiser again in my new place (as I'm now fully in love with the Bergmeister for all my other esk8 board, my push board remember me that maybe it could be cool to still get an urethan setup).
So I will try to make a slick little rally street surfer :blush: 

Also the Blasto Saw :

... make me want my actual daily board with an AWD setup with the Mad Hub 60kV DD on it ... :drooling_face:

![](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/ezgif-5-7bdf7bf1d425.gif)

So, to make a compromise :slight_smile:
- I will make my AT Hubz I was working on, for more than 2 years now I guess :sweat_smile: :money_with_wings: (I have posted a tease-pic last winter or maybe in 2016... :upside_down_face:).
And by mixing my 2 projects with the other > Big hub motor project in wheel with 8072 I had planned originally with Gummies.

Like that, I will save a bit some money (as I have already started working on the motor since last year, to stagger the payment of the different parts ... it will cost me around +800€ for the prototype) and a lot of time like already say, but useful !

I've been thinking over the options. So I think I see:

1. nice cheap powerful hub motors 90mm. Possible to mount on cronins a HUUUGE plus.

2. option for DD with these motors but not so cheap ($450usd), 97mm-110mm. #1 has wheel price included. But, TB is more money, Carvon is/was more money.  Close to hummie motor range.

3. 60kv only really for pneumies, which means DD which means not so cheap

And Mad Fury is in development. :)

I'm definitely down for #1 -- maybe multiple. I want DD and I want to try 60kv, but this is harder to justify for me.

So still thinking about what and how many... :)

@rey8801 will you have swappable adapters for ABEC11 and kegel cores? And thanks for doing all this stuff.

I think you your projects are great. Prototyping takes a lot of time. We all know it. Having something unique you thought about it is priceless, at least for me. 
Cocerning the AWG Mad Fury I would suggest 75Kv for wheels up to 100mm and then try the 60Kv for above. As I said I get the right speed calculation if I use 100% motor efficiency in the esk8 calculator tool.
60Kv Mad hubs are teasing me a lot! but they were never tested so I ma fine with doing it for since. I already didi the same for the Mad hubs 130 and 75Kv, so why not? 
Thanks to @ervinelin for the pulley adapter I think that mount **beirgmeister** on the DD would be really easy. I will keep the front panel in metal for real support and then the pulleies can be interchangeable for every AT wheels I want since they are big we can model them on top.

My thoughts:


1- True. You can mount them on whatever truck you are willing to modify. Here on an evolve I did for a guy
![image|690x387](upload://ms19EzR25F8dS0hetPrPQefkbHF.jpeg) 
![image|690x387](upload://q2nh956VqRnUcTQXnm4mFeyRBrz.jpeg) 
To be honest here you will have to cut the axle, make new thread so not so easy as for other trucks, but just to show that it is feasible.


2- Agree, but believe me it doesn't depends on me. It's the price of machining parts. I bring here the hubs at the factory price I get. I think I have like 5-10 euro on top of a full set if custom doesn't do any jokes! Just to understand, not to complain about it, to be clear. 
On the other hands tell me where you find a 450$ motors for this power that you can interchange between hubs and DD? That why I wanted to start this project. In this perspective they are dirty dirty cheap. Plus if you want a 4WD then these things will bend you. I can only imagine a 4wd 75Kv with a 12s5p battery. A monster, for less then 380 Euro.

I do not want even think myself next to TB, Enertion ecc...they have other aims in their mind, I am only a guy who make fun stuffs in his basement during nights. That's it. You say Mad Fury is in development, and thanks god it will always be. I am using my prototype everyday and for me the main project was finished, I would just keep updating it as I do for the rest. that's why I started the MAD Storm, they are in real development. So when you buy from a known company you pay more, but you buy customer service, warranty, employer wedges ecc... So it's normal that it costs more. I love what they are bringing to the market, but I just like it to make my version. I won't never be able to deliver the same amount of parts than they do. Mine as limited production lines, but you will find me on the other side to bring something new with them.

The reason why the DD is now an available option is because people asked me about it and since a second GB was needed for the mad hubs, I thought to give it a try. I can not put in advance the cost of let say 10 full sets of DD machined by a company, plus I do not want to do it. I already have mine. After machined them they will be shipped in one week, well depends how busy I am at work, but one drive  a day is feasible to do the pre-assembly.  After the idea is that you decide between keep the hubs or go to DD.

 
3- 60Kv as to be tested so I can not be 100% sure, but since the motor is the same, so far I get the real speed I measured durign ride when I apply 100% motor efficiency in the calculator, so 60Kv would be awesome from 100mm on at 12s. I just say that better to stay to 75Kv if you are not willing to be a tester for that. I will do the test probably anyway, so don't worry :rofl:
Concerning AT wheels there are expensive ones and cheap ones. I probably want to make a really small AT for commute and want to try these 5 inch wheels. https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/5X1-5-Factory-rubber-tire-for_60856645682.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.1.7b942142O232mh
Or 6 inch wheels from Ali as well for really cheap.

I will have ABEC, kegel options of course. Once I have the prices we can decide the combination. For me for the DD the best solution is to go with the 3D printed outer motor CAN, as I am using it. In order to keep the price lower and then swap the front pulleys, which can be a flat one as the render on top and then the adapter can be just small metal piece on top, again to keep the price low. Not the quality, I am looking for efficiency over than price! 
Anyway I will make a video next week so you can see the real performance of them


I hope I answered to all your doubts and make clear my point of view :grin:

Edit: I wanted to specify that you have to read this as a chilly conversation, esk8 is fun for me and I do not want that no one interprets what I say wrong. I totally understand your point of view. You think from a buyer point of view, but I do not see myself as a seller, but as a maker :wink:

As I wrote I am waiting the quotation from the company for machining the parts. Of I have to make all of them would be too slow. Then when I will have quotation in few days I guess I will post it here the possible combinations of price to make it happen. Since I will post the price, I stsrt counting 2 weeks then close the GB for the hubs. That order would be fulfilled no matter the direct drive. Then for the DD if we reach a decent number to allow low price I will order them and I guess it will take 2-3 weeks for the parts to come.
Differently hubs based on precious GB will arrive in 2 weeks after payment. 
Then folks with the DD kit can choose either to get the hub first, if they want to ride them immidiately and I will send the kit later or wait for a single shipment. That depends on you.

**IMPORTANT Update**

I finally got the quotations for the DD kit. I decided to make available 10 DD drive kit, if we reach this amount then is possible to get for the price listed, otherwise would be for the next time :smile:. I will also partecipate, not looking forward to machine another full set for the 60Kv Mad hubs I am gonna test with a short AT build. Super happy...

**The only modification needed in order to use the kit is to enlarge the rear motor collet hole from 8 to 12mm.** I will do it for who will take the motors now but in case someone already have the motors I will make a tutorial. Nothing special, just drill straight but you never know.

Price for the **whole metal kit** should be higher but I decided to contribute for the beta round so I will keep it to **200 Euro**.( a kit with 3D printed motor can, not included, is also possible if we all agreed. It would decrease the price  though)

The whole metal kit includes:

- 2 pulleys (I guess we all want Kegel right?). The final design will allow you to the attach different 3D printed pulleys, kinda of open source :grin:. The one it comes with is metal.

- 2 motor can black anodised

- 2 wheel spacer

- 2 hub adapter (for use the motors as hub motors)

- 1 custom truck black anodised

- 4 NSK bearings

As I said that will be only for first 10 sets. If we won't reach this number then the DD kit won't be possible unfortunately, while the hubs still stays. They are totally worth it as hubs too.

**I will close the GB on 31/03/19 or if we reach the threshold for the DD sooner.**

New google form to be fill it up for the DD only. Personal details only needed it if you did not fill it up the previous google form for the hubs.
For clarification, if you do not have the hubs already you have to fill it up the 2 forms. One for the hub, the other for the DD.

Always available for clarifications... :wink:

Ciao ciao 

PS: I included a liability waiver in the form, not because I am an ass hole, but because I am try to give something to the community and moreover develop something. I know this community is great and I truly love it, but you never know. I just wanted to state clear that I am doing as an hobby.

Wait. So as I said the hubs and the conversion kit have to be seen as separate parts. 
The hubs part you can order the hubs only. And as option you have the pre drilled Paris 180mm clone truck (10 euro) only rear and the spare sleeve (10 euro each).
The DD kit comes with everything you need to use it no potions needed is full optional already :grin:

I misunderstood, sorry.

Just to be clear that I'm not misunderstanding, I have to sign up for both forms. At the first form I don't need the PU sleeves as they are for the hub motors only. I also don't need the Paris trucks as they are included with the DD kit. All the rest is included, except for the wheels (any Kegel style wheel will do). I would just screw it on my board (screws not included) and plug the connectors in my VESC. Am I missing something?

I'm sorry if I ask stupid questions, I'm quite new to the esk8 world :S.

I love what you are doing, and I cannot wait to try it out!

No problem, your doubts are the others doubts so I hope it will be useful for others too.

So there is stll a bit of confusion. I do not provide front truck by any mean. It's a clone paris truck what you can have with the hubs, but also a original paris truck wil lwork or whatever truck you are willing to modify. The front truck you can by it on ALi for cheap or original paris from skate shops. Just keep in mind that the hubs add 3 cm on the side so it's better to pair it with a paris 190mm in front. The hubs already comes with sleeves, the 10 euro is for spare ones. So you can always use them as hubs too.

In case of the DD the custom rear truck hanger is uncluded, but you need the base plate. Whihc is made for a Paris truck but can probably work with the other too. 
Bolts are not included but skateboard hardware is usually M5 x 35-40mm bolt and nut. 
I think everyone wants kegel afdapter but as I said I will try to make within the price the design with optimize adapter so that I can share the front panel step file and everyone can desing his own adapter and print it.  I advice 97mm wheel at least. Otherwise the clearance will be rather low.
Last things motors comes with bullet 4mm and jst 1.5mm PH as most of the motors. So will have to change it or use adaptors based on whihc connectos you have on the vesc. I can offer these connectors for cheap if need it, don't worry already did with the previous GB. I advice everyone to install their own since we are talking about a DIY forum and assembly is part of the game, but if someone is really out of the game and wants me to do it, I can help but will have to wait that I ship the other drives first.

I think TB board succeeded  in putting a bigger stator in it. I don't make these motors, to be clear, I only organised the GB for them. I made the conversion kit to DD. They although have a decent stator size that's probably why they are stronger than average hubs.

Hi. Yes and yes. It's a conversion kit. You need to modify a bit the original motor but you get an adapter with the DD kit to switch back to hub motor.
60Kv use the same motor different winding. Is what I am gonna test it next with bergmeister wheels for my commute short AT board. Would be the first motors at 60Kv, never made before.

Ahahaha all noted! About the Pulley when the people who will get the direct drive kit are decided we will have a chat and decide which Pulley to go. The quotation is for 5 pairs of each. Can be 10 pairs on one style and 5 of the other. Or only 10 on one. As long we meet at least 5 pairs is feasible otherwise the company will ask to much for making them.
@Riako is testing the ABEC core with flywheels 97 or 90mm and 107mm.. I tested with esk8wheels 97mm, clone abec. Probably @pookybear will give a try too, thanks pal.

Youll want to change it to the 75kv, I promise. Theyre stupid inefficient, and although fast, would greatly benefit from increased torque. I would think that 85/90kv would be the ultimate hubs for urethane, but for a dd, rey is right, 60 or 75kv is great.

Yes guys believe me. @Sn4pz is right.  I am here to really help and advice on them . I have used both. Maybe the 4wd would cover the low torque inefficiently but 75Lv is just right...really strong, fast and efficient. No point for 130Kv. You want more speed than 55kmh? Take the DD and use 100mm. That what I would do. I will post a video with a bit of telemetry to understand the performance in few hours

The conversion will take only the time unscrews bolts. Only modification to motor is a 12mm hole at the the back. I will do it and pre assemble the custom truck. You will only need to swap the motors on the DD hanger or use them as hubs with a normal hanger Paris style.
As previous GB I will make a tutorial, but really is super easy. That was the purpose :wink:

When I order them together between the two order there will be 2 weeks of difference I guess. If you want the hubs alone first then you will need to drill the hole as I will show or send them back to me if you are not sure. Otherwise If you can wait a bit more due to CNC production I will pre assemble all of them...

Ok, everything is ready. I am so happy to bring this project in reality with machined parts from a company and not from my basement. We have 3 kits left but I do not care, I will cover the rest, one is going to my mini AT project so 2 left for future. I think it turned out amazing and I wanted to thank you with adding a small logo for al the beta round backers. I want to highlights that those are uniques pieces, first of production, that's why **MF limited**  :wink:
In case was still not clear the design allow you to make your own adapter as you like it. It will come with Kegel adapter in Alu, but ABEC is also available. We do need to reach the MOQ of 5 pairs for that, otherwise company won't produce smaller amounts. I think the additional adapter I can provide it for 55 Euro the pair. If we buy more than is cheaper. I also show it with a Bergmeister adapter since that what I am going to use it with the custom 60Kv motor for a sick short AT to replace my buddy.

:laughing: They got me as well. Then 2 kits left!

For who is getting the DD kit please le me know which adapter you want included in the kit between Kegel or ABEC. Keep in mind that 97mm wheels are advice so for the moment no a lot of choice in the Kegel side.
Anyhow the choice is yours. In case we want to get also the other adapter then at least 5 pair need and it will cost 55Euro (for the pair). The possibility are like 5 pairs of each, 10 of only one and then if we reach 5 for the other. 6 of one and 4 of the other is not possible unfortunately. I hope you got the logic behind.

If you read carefully 90mm popca is for hubs configuration. Thst what I advice for the front wheels. For the adapter the metal one ready are kegel and Abec. As I said the front panel will be open source meaning you can design and print whatever Pulley you want and since bergmeister is pretty fat it can be easily printed. That what I am going to do. I will share front panel file, berigmeister file once I tested with the wheels. 
You probsbly know but the 60Kv will be the first one made. Meaning me and if you want it you will be the first one to own them so we no previous test done. They are the same motors, but different loops to have 60Kv ratio.
Sorry if I keep saying the same things but I want to be sure everyone understand everything.

I've got a LaCroix but I'm not getting on well with the MBS Matrix II trucks. That's why I'm in on The Hammock! Really excited about that!

Now I'm looking at hangers and drive options. I need something very wide to replace the Matrix II's, which are about 400 mm. Best I can find right now is either the Fatboy 240 or the Kahua.

Is Mad Fury an option here? Could they deliver enough power and torque to drive an 8" hub and would the performance be consistent with (or better than) the standard 6374s?
```

the mad fury are powerful and stator size is comperable and more than most of the 6374 motors out there. The problem that they are 75Kv to high for 8inch pneumatic. There is a option of 60Kv and I ma getting them for testing but they were never made before so I can not say too much about it. Also with 60Kv the top speed will be too high so you will have looses in torque. I think the best option in that case would be 4wd then I am sure it will deliver what you need. Anyhow I made them for standard deck so the axle is 290mm wide. Too far from what you need. Also the MAD storm that I ma making now that uses 6380 motors will be around 320mm wide. If you need a such wide hanger then I think gear drive is the way to go. @moon is making a beta test round maybe you can still get on board. Just my honest opinion.

Sorry I'm late ^^

About larger one ? I guess you're right about the Kahua en FB240 ... but a full kit of two truck is less than a hanger :smile: Or maybe wait a little bit for the precision Kahua that @riverside.rider is working on.

(JTK, I haven't SF RKP, how wide is it with the 200mm hanger and 80/90mm axel ? )

If you're gonna use them on 8" even with a 4WD/AWD setup I don't think it can egalize a dual rear setup of geared 6374 ... But maybe I'm wrong.  
With air tire, I would go Quattro with hub.

I really can't wait to see you're Berg + 60kV Mad Fury setup and feedback Alessio !  
Can't wait to finish my custom hub motor for AT wheels (6.5/7/8") with a 80mm motor!!

the short one won't be too difficult to organise a GB. It's solid, pretty fast to make it and I think I can bring here for like 135-150$ in case of only 10 decks. Just a rough estimation. Everything depends on how many. Shipping is a killer for decks.

Sounds great, if anyone wants to sell let me know. BTW was using these motors on my first build, bought them in Dez 2016 from Torque boards. The motors are awesome, but the ring kept coming off, and at some stage I redrilled the windings from M3 to M4 this held for a while. But now one of the rings is completely fallen to pieces. Maybe had I used thread locker and never touched them all would be fine.

I thought they where both M4 no? I thought the motor can is the same. I have spare new ones that you can change the older one to the new. I have tried and the older version fits the new cover as well. Otherwise I have the same one you have if you want but as you could see is weaker. Just pm your address and I will ship you the older one for free or like few Euro for a pair of the new ones. As you want. I use them as DD anyway. Happy to help

PS: With the new ones you need also new sleeves. I have them as well. As I said as you want :grin:

Sounds like there are three version of the motor and you have the second and the third. Mine is M3, in the photo you can see that one of the bolts is M3 and the other ones are M4. That's because I redrilled only 4 of the 6 threads to M4. The holes in the ring also needed redrilling. That same ring with M4 is all I need for now, but I'd be happy to take the newer version and sleeves as well for sure. Thanks a lot! :)

They are 2 types inside the DD and the one outside are what you said. They are classical model from SFK, NSK. They are expensive though. I bought quite some to drop the price. The model is just 6900 and you should find it online somewhere. I am not in US but I am sure you can get it. The DU is the sealing. Those are rubber sealed, because I find it more durable for bearing in contact with dirt. But you can get whatever seaming as long is fine for you.
If you don't find it I have more that I can sell to you :smile:
