Hello folks!
A friend of mine gave me his contact for this **Hub Motors**. They look exactly as the TorqueBoards ones, with same specs ecc... I believe they are the same :laughing: As far as I know they performe quite good and I will get it one pair for sure or maybe 2 because I can not decide between **75Kv and 130Kv** (life dilemma!). I have the diyebaord 90mm hub 75Kv and they are strong but I got used to the top speed. I know there is Carvon and other option for direct drive but for the moment I still want to follow my passion without spend a fortune :sweat_smile:
**Update 19/07/2018**
Here the new and to me more better deal. The original deal was 215 Euro with the truck. Since the guy didn't have the truck we were going to pay it more. So the new deal I got it is still for a small order. We need to reach at least ** 10 sets of dual hubs or 20 hubs in total**. As I said they come without the Paris truck (clone) but you can purchase them for really cheap, either locally or on Ali (1pair New 8" long board trucks P bridge paris skateboard trucks electric skateboard truck 8inch dancing board long board bridges
 http://s.aliexpress.com/eQ7RBFJv?fromSns=Copy to Clipboard - price for two) :wink: 
  **the hub are 75Kv or 130Kv**. They are **hall sensored**, but you will need an adapter or change the JST connector since they have a ZH 1.5mm as the torqueboards hubs, but you need a PH 2mm connector for the VESC. Of course I can offer to do that for you for cheap. The specs are exactly the same as the torqueboards and they advice
**75Kv - 10/12s top speed around 25mhP**
**130Kv - 6/8s Top speed around 20mhp**
**What is interesting to me 12s 130Kv way above 30mhp** (keep in mind 4.12 VESC ERPM limitation)

That being said I will probably go for 130Kv and 10s. I know the ERPM is a bit at the limit but whatever :rofl: Other guys already did it, so who I am to say no to my heart.
Now the nice part, for 20 hubs or 10 dual sets, we can have them for **90 Euro for single, or 170 Euro for dual, shipped to me (custom duties paid)**. Of course we can order more, but I will send the order as long we reach the threshold since it's gonna be a small batch anyway and I do not what to wait to long. As option the guy also have **spare PU sleeve** in case you want to buy it already ( I will), **20 Euro a set of 2 (or 10 Euro each** :wink:). If you want me to order the truck (maybe you need only one and do not want to pay for the second one) and ship them all together, I can do it as well. 
I am in Belgium so then you only need to cover the shipping to your place or come and pick it up! I checked the shipping cost:

With Tracking Number
**EU Country around Belgium 20 Euro** (Germany, France (except Dom-Tom), Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Netherlands and United Kingdom.
**Rest of EU and USA 30 Euro** (Azores, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Madeira, Malta, Man (Island), Monaco, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic, Croatia)
If you have a better method to ship them, just tell me.

I think I said everything, I hope I calculated correctly otherwise instead of save money I am gonna be the only one loosing it. Of course if I get a better deal I will let you know, but It looks already good to me. For any question contact me. Just to make it clear, I am not try to fool anyone, I just like the idea of sharing in a community. If we will manage to get the deal I will keep you posted daily or weekly as you want.

Note: Since I couldn't wait, I have already order a 130Kv test drive system. I should get it soon, unfortunately I will be k  holiday so can only report back about it in 2-3 weeks. I will try to post pictures once I receive it anyway. My plan is to slightly modify it to improve the mounting system. I will follow what it has already been proved work and add something more (simple stuff). Don't worry it's gonna be simple modifications that I will share with you. You can either do it by yourself (Remember it's a DIY forum) or if it is a problem I can do it for you before ship the motors (with a fair charge on it :laughing:). Some information regarding the modifications are in the posts below  but I first need to inspect motor and truck to decide it.
As I said I have already bought a unit, so I hope that I am actually fine. I have just thought it can be a good deal compare to the original price and I didn't want to keep it only for me.

Ciao ciao...

They are a good option if you want speed, but the DIYeboard ones you have are the stronger and overall better ones.

I am not in for a set (still have my Jacob Hubs) but wanted to give my 2ct:
Take care that the sensor wire plugs fit the VESC without adapter and try to find out the thickness of the urethane. 
Otherwise seems like a fair price (crazy how cheap these things got - my Jacob Hubs were 250 and a steal at the time)

I am happy with the diyeboard one, I just got used of the speed and I would like to try something else. I know hummie should be the way but they are not ready and after shipping and custom are too expensive for what I wish to spend.
Anyhow I though these hub are quite reliable. I always find opposite reviews about everything. I guess it's a matter of point of view.

The sensor should be correct but I will ask again. Anyhow is not a big deal change it, I also did it for my diyeboard hubs.
Yeh the price is rather cheap. Although I think it's just because it's directly from the factory and without any profit on my site. I am actually dealing for maybe a better price, at least for me. Basically the guys don't have the Paris truck so they have to source outside and we would end by paying more. If I did the calculation correct with the new deal I could offer 1 hub for 90 Euro shipped to me or 170 Euro for two hubs. For this deal we need to each 20 hubs order (or 10 dual set). It's without Paris truck but I found them at 35$ in Ali the pair (2 trucks). I think I am getting one dual set up anyway. I will update the price once the guy confirm it.

Guys @TarzanHBK @Maxid    I had an idea. Since I don't like the idea ti provide something that can be not reliable I will probably buy a set of 130Kv even if I pay them more. I prefer torque and I would buy the 75Kv over the 130Kv if someone can confirm that goes at leat at 45km/h loaded. I know that based on the Esk8 calculator 40km/h should be the top speed but I have seen motors perform different at the same Kv. Do you know someone that can give me an idea?
Back to the idea :laughing: basically what I understood based on information available that those hub motor are good as motor but not well designed in term of screw and truck mounting. They main suck due to the back screws that tend to backout and the axel screw being only 2 small screws. So since I have some nice tool where I work I could drill new threads all the way the front plate (pics showing the original threads going only until the plate) and secure them with bolt from the outside.

![IMG_20180717_195352|690x452](upload://R1PKyxI4z2ufEGRdVqdIFXJ10U.jpg)

 Then this problem should be solved. For the second issue I can drill small holes enough to allow the screw to actually sit inside the truck instead of only pushing on it. I can also add a 3rd and 4th ones if I see the needs. 
![IMG_20180717_200248|500x500](upload://1xbz0Ernvhq9CLk7vnXPuwgR7Xd.jpg)

What do you think? Would it work? Thx :grin:

I got this picture showing the thickness of the uretane. It's on the harder side so it's not bouncy. I do use shocks pads with my current diyeboard hubs and they help.

Yeh I will figure it out soon :joy: Did you get 75Kv or 130Kv? I am try to figure it out which speed can I get from the 75Kv, really one with a 10s battery. I already have the diyeboard 75Kv hubs I want something more. I am looking at least 45 Km/h with nice torque. Does your brother still have torque with them, even at 130Kv?
I am planning to modify them to make them more safe (read previous post). Did you have any problem screws related? Thx man!

I did read it and the part abut the collar screw is gonna be similar, but I am planning to either had one or more screw for a total of 3 or 4. The second different is that I am planning to install real nut facing outside the hub to secure the back screws that are only kept in place by loctite. Where do you find those modifications in that thread?

Damn! Now I am more confused than ever...you you try the esk8 calculator it says around 24mhp top speed with 75Kv, which is indeed what I get with the 75Kv Diyeboard hubs. That's why I though about the 130Kv for this ones.

22 mph but that esc is limited. Very quick to 22 and then it would go back and forth between 22 and 21 kind of like how a car governor works.

This is the kind of behavior I get with the combination of diyeboard 75kw hubs and vesc which is able to cruise at 23 24 mph. I guess I will go for the 130Kv version hoping the torque is not going to be ridiculous. Thanks a lot for your help :)

No as the torqueboards ones is a jst 1.5.. 6 pins and you need jsh 2mm 6 pins. But no problem either you do it or I can prepare them for like 3 euro. I already did for mine hub motor.
Anyhow I couldn't resist and I bought one test dual 130kv hub motors. I will then buy Paris truck from China for really cheap. I think this one would be the better deal since you will get your complete set up for like 210 Euro to your place. I still have to re-check the math but it's something like that :grin:
Should be 170 hubs to my place. The rest is up to you, shipping and If you want the truck you can find them for cheap otherwise we can order them and I will send them too ecc...

I will post a Pic once I get them, but I can work on it only when I am back.

No it's another guy, oh well at least seems like. I bought from China directly and I always have the impression that you won't really know what it's going on. Probably there are all connected when it's part of a small niche as electric skateboard. I didn't search directly I got the contact from a friend. I hope the it doesn't take that long! Well I am on holiday anyway :rofl:
Since apparently it's possible to get it from different retailers I am wondering if someone knows the probably only real factory behind and why it doesn't just come up with the best deal ever.

I bought the 130Kv and I already spent more than the deal here listed. I just hope I don't get custom otherwise I will end up with quite a lot more :laughing: I wanted to see what they actually have and if I like it. Moreover in case the 130Kv are not suitable for me I would be still in time to get another 75Kv with the deal, if we can make. Otherwise so be it.

I contacted the guy. I updated the deal in the first post. With 10 dual sett the cheaper I could get is 170 Euro to my place. To me the price is great compare to the retail one. I am in Belgium. Then it's up to you, based of where you are we can arrange it as you like. I put the shipping cost that I found from my local post. I used them a lot e I found them cheap compare to DHL ecc...although if you have another way is welcome. You can also come and pick it up in case, no problem. I ordered a test dual set up. I will report back once I have it and I will test it with the additional modifications that I believe can help to improve the mounting system. Really easy modifications. I also bought the trucks from the link mentioned in the first post, so you will see all together before actually buy it....For Science! I needed to try. That what I kept telling me :laughing:

Hi! I am going to run them in 10s. I have a bluetooth module connected so I will post the data and a comparison with my current hub motors 75Kv from diyeboard (meepo style one).
Anyhow in 12s they should perform similar to the video bigboytoys posted about it. My only concern is the ERPM. With 10s should be still ok when loaded (I will limit the ERPM anyway). For 12s either VESC6 or similar or limit the ERPM.
EDIT: I am talking about the 130Kv version. With 12s I would probably go with 75Kv to have both speed and torque. They should be able to reach 30mph despite rated at 75Kv.
Concerning the temp sensor, I counted 6 wires for the JST connector so I would guess they have it since they are usually 5v, GND, 3 hall sensors and temp.

@pat.speed @Colson003 Yes they are 14 poles so 10s and mostly 12s you have to limit the ERPM in the VESC setting. If you check the video about it in 12s they reached 38-39mhp which is insane for hubs. I think that in 10s once loaded you are still pretty safe. I won't spin them at max on bench

So here the pics of how they look like. They seem legit. The screws come without loctite, better because I wanted to open them anyway. The copper wiring seems nice and as the torque board they have 22 stators and 28 magnets. The replaceable PU is rather thicker but harder than the Meepo hubs, I think it's listed at 90A, we'll see how comfortable they are. For sure the PU will last longer. The motor size is remarkable, I put it next to the mouse to better understand the size. They come 4mm bullet connectors, as the majority of brushless motors, so I will change them to 5.5mm ones for my VESC. As well as the JST to the PH ones. NOt a big deal.
Next week when back I will install them and test it :wink:

At the end I got the clone today, when I have ordered the original one yesterday. Fine, I can choose which one to use. One question, by looking to your pictures seem like your hub could slide on the truck without any modification but in my case the end of the truck doesn't come out of the wheels. I would need to modify the truck.
![hub6|690x387](upload://7YEmhdArmIcVxj4DTLHNG0tgEqL.jpg)
As you can see, I need 5 cm of axle bar to reach the other side. The inner diameter of the hub becomes the same of the bar where indicated by the arrow. Although your truck looks the same size of what I have. Do you think it is because of the 130Kv compare to 75Kv? Thx

EDIT: I see, I didn't see the axle extension in package to actually attach them. Nevermind.
So actually your rear truck is wider than the front one.

No no I didn't check the entire box. The extensions are two black aluminium things, really easy to use. The size of the motors is the same indeed.
About the different between the two trucks I never used both on the same board, but since they are not precision truck anyway, the difference is mainly made by pivot cup and bushing, which I do replace it.

Complete review will come. Today first day riding them. I have to admit that I am a bit scared :laughing:
I still have to get the confidence with them. 130Kv (mine are actually 110Kv, better) with 10s3p 30Q battery. BLDC sersored, smooth AF. Results is crazy fast! To be honest I do not if I can get the top speed with my short board. I hit above 40 in 30-40 meters. They have slightly lower take off power than the 75Kv (mine are 65Kv), although if you push the throttle they still pull. The difference that around 15 km/h they start to pull as hell. I will post a better review in the next days. I need to ride them :wink:...

I made a how to do tutorial :wink: I will post everything. I just do not have time. Moreover the clone trucks I are not the right choice.good that I test them. Basically they are like the Paris 195mm trucks. Which is not bad because you need stability but then the rear truck gains additional width due to the hubs attached so you should run either dual 180mm and have the rear truck a bit wider, as @Westy did. Or pair 195 front and 150 rear to have almost the same width. You gain about 3 cm each side at the rear truck. I ordered Original Paris truck. We will see. Now I would be curious to try the 75Kv how strtrong do they pull.

Take your time! I‘m not experienced with trucks right now but plan a build similar to yours, so I would be happy for any recommendations 😉 don’t mind to buy original trucks thou. But they should end up the same width for sure.
If you have an opportunity to try out, I would be interested in which range you get with 10s3p (guess you use q30 right)?

For the same width with this hubs the best is 195 front and 150 back. Also 180 and 150 will work, just check the picture above from @Westyand you see the difference with double 180mm. You can buy single truck anyway, so one for each type. I order the original one, because I didn't want to wait anymore.
I have been using my battery Sanmsing 30q 10s3p since June. Good battery in term size / performance. For a short board is great. I won't go lower. Minimum voltage sag toward 20% left. With my previous hub I was always at full throttle and I could get about 22 Km out of it. If you have 25kmh average 30 is feasible.

Why you say 47kmh with 75Kv? In calculator I get 40knh which is indeed what I get from my 75Kv hub motors from diyeboard.
Top speed of today... It can go more, 65% of the throttle used. I was to scared to push it forward.

Its just a rough estimate.
Given you have a full battery you can go faster.
75kv x 37v= 2775 rpm, Wheel circumference: 9cm x pi=28.27cm

Length travelled: 2775 x 28.27= 784m/min

784/60= 13.07 m/s 13.07 x 3.6 = 47.07 km/h

I also calculate the speed like you did Linsus.

You need to think about that the kv rating isn't exactly 75kV, it can be a bit lower.
Also battery sag is important and of course efficiency.
If you're using a 10S3P 30Q pack and pulling 45A will give a 4V voltage drop to this specific pack.
So those little factors will influence the speed.

Like Rey said 85% with the calculator looks also fine to me.

I have been riding the 130Kv hubs (in reality 110Kv) for the past week. I will post a review I hope this weekend. I would like to test the 75Kv too but unfortunately I can not pay another motors just for test them. Single set are expensive. Judging by the higher Kv one I thing they would be really impressive in torque. These motor are way more powerful than the diyeboard one...way more believe me! Anyhow @markyoe also joined so we still have 4 places left.

Yeh I will mention in the review. Motor doesn't have the temp sensor. I wanted to compare them with the same setting I had on the diyeboard hubs. After push then quite hard they become hotter but you can still touch them, I do not see it critical, for sure the diyeboard runs cooler but the reason why is the different in power I guess. Anyhow up to know the major problem I have is the 4.12 VESC that if I push hard it heats up easily. Of course if I ride more in an enjoyable way let say and not try to beat any records I do not this problem. I am now trying some more conservative setting. That also why I am getting vesc6 based. Fun fact to understand how much they can pull is that I never reach 95% of duty with these motor. Before I used to pull the throttle all the way down and you see from the telemetry the duty at 95% and then the motor amp, speed ecc increasing over time. With these motor I can reach at most 70-80% afterward my setting limits the power. When you ride you do not feel it but basically I reach all the battery and motor max limit. I can still reach 50khm easy, too easy maybe. Probably 10s4p or Lipo or bigger battery are better with this motors. To be honest now that I have seen the power they can deliver I would like to try the 75Kv, they probably have a really great great torque.

Shipping cost the same for all Europe. Only country around Belgium have 10 euro reduction. Max is 30 euro like everyone. The urethane is true that is 90A and I was worry about too. But it actually runs 4 times better than the diyeboard hubs. Not say that is like the full skateboard wheel because is impossible with hubs. But with exactly same set up these hubs absorb way better vibration. I feel really good on road with them. The urethane is 1.5cm thicker that probably why you feel less. Moreover the free wheel with these hubs is great. I mainly accellarste and let them coast. They have 1/3 of the resistance of the other hubs. Really this point is pro

The take off is good. The diyeboard has more kick due to the lower Kv in the first 10 meter but then bye bye... Really bye bye. Although I would like to know the  75Kv of those things. If you see the video you see the belt drive in front the first meters, same things. Basically they pull strong until 15kmh then you feel like a kick and they really reach 50kmh in 30meter. 40kmh you don't even realized. Maybe too much.

Could you try them on hills? I am worried that heavier riders like me, 90kg, could have problems on hills with 110kv.
You will see with the Vesc 6 variant your board will perform in a completely different way.

I have tried them on hills. I climb 3 hills along the road I do every day to work. The steepest hill is probably 15-20 degree, not sure they are almost the same.
![Picturse1|690x335](upload://lM5BShiaunJWdZlE0EIdPlVaOFO.jpg)
Maybe from the picture is not clear but most of the people get off the bike and do it by foot. I do it by bike but believe me that was one of the reason why I opted for an electric skateboard. Every morning, after breakfast and cold muscles is a nightmare. Anyhow. with backpack I am around 84-86 kg so not that far, and I can go up these hills easy. I do not feel the motor suffering. As I said the range where these motor are less efficient than the diyeboard 75Kv is from 0 to 10. There you can have almost the same torque but you have to pull a lot the throttle and by doing so dealing with high peak current, so nice battery and nice vesc needed. IF you have a minimum on momentum before take the hills, like 5kmh you can accellerate easy on the slope and reach higher speed than the 75Kv. It's really for the first 5-10kmh that they pull more, but not a lot, becuase the diyeboard I used to go full throttle immidiately after take off, this one I prefer to give them 5 kmh more. You feel that there is more juice available, if that makes sense. Anyhow on the other hills that are like 5-10 degree, so slightly incline I went up easy at 40-45kmh. Too make it short, below 5-10kmh these hub motor 130Kv (110Kv) are lees efficient than 75Kv, which is normal, but afterwards they fly. I would really like to try the 75Kv ones. I knew only few people that used them on the forum, probably due to the price and the one that wrote in this thread use them with a ESC so the power is limited, but the top speed he gets is 36-37kmh telling me that they are probably 65Kv in reality.

Anyhow with this setting the vesc run way cooler, but you loose a bit of peak current, meaning torque. Still enjoyable and plenty of speed though.

Yes I actually used before to lowered with the nano X. Now I am using the firefly remote Arduino based and it has a lot more of throttle control. So I do not need to lower the throttle curve. Although in this case can be that I will increase it a bit, but with this remote you only need to pull the throttle a bit further to have the same power, that's it. On the other hand you have a lot more overall control.

**REVIEW**
Hello folk! As promise I would like to share my thought about these hubs, that from now on I called MAD hubs, because it is what I thought when I ride them for the first time and to make it easier recalled them. Plus a comparison with the known ones from DIYEboard (Meepo style) http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-558.html.
The MAD hubs come in two version 75Kv and 130Kv, rated at 1800w peak current and 500w continuous. You may notice that they look like the one Torque Board was selling and indeed they have the same specs too, but I want to specify that they do not come from them. That’s also the reason why I wanted to first test them before close the GB. For the test I got the 130Kv ones, mainly because my plan was to find new hub motors to replace the DIYEboard ones, which are great, but I got used of the top speed and I wanted something more!
As board I used a spud build (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-the-avenger-jet-spud-dual-hubs-motors-custom-10s3p-30q-maytech-vescs/52437?page=3) having a 10s3p Samsung 30Q battery and 2 Maytech’s  VESCs.
I first wanted to describe the 130Kv hub motors itself. They came assembled, without the truck. On the website they advice to use Paris style trucks since you need rounded hanger ends, but if you are willing to modify other trucks, such as caliber,  they will work too. For the test I bought Paris clone truck from Ali (I will post my thoughts about them later one). Here you can find some pics of the disassembled motor.

![IMG_20180811_143446|281x500](upload://euBCP08SyQMOaycoQN3sXX1kDMG.jpg)![IMG_20180811_143359|690x388](upload://36jTIPGx822wGoEogDmtw7GfqwH.jpg)![IMG_20180811_141155|690x388](upload://vUq2QNDQeh2u9VxF1fNguHcsBmW.jpg)![IMG_20180811_143633|281x500](upload://pJOmY15OXv7UMWTRpyj3CQ6BOqK.jpg)![IMG_20180811_131739|690x388](upload://kkTLSgClPwNY985ISryp3g6J6tP.jpg)![IMG_20180811_131851|690x388](upload://wFq2V9LAjEWEEnkAsKYTap35TgS.jpg)![IMG_20180811_131902|690x388](upload://dY8cNa2giLgVBc1a6wKOH0G2QJu.jpg)![IMG_20180811_131910|281x500](upload://q5TsPkdnetETzwPPF7AI2eqWRPy.jpg)
![hub6|690x387](upload://7YEmhdArmIcVxj4DTLHNG0tgEqL.jpg)

The motor size is comparable with a 6355 outrunner motor and overall looks good. I am not an expert in judging windings, but it seems legit. Looking at the motor itself I first didn’t like some design choices. The motor can is kept together with long screws that are attached only at the end. The motors mount on the truck with a collar that slides on the end of hanger and uses two screws to secure the motors in place. Last thing the PU used is a 90mm 90A which I thought would be too hard.
For the installation I follow the tips given on the forum https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/tips-on-installing-torque-boards-dual-hub-motors/29586/6?u=rey8801, but I will also post later on a step by step “how to do it tutorial”, with pictures for better understanding.
For the comparison I chose to post the telemetry data from both the two hubs (130Kv MAD hubs  Vs 75Kv DIYEboard) recorded on the same trip. For better comparison I used the same board and settings for both, the only differences were the motors and that the MAD hubs run sensored.


**Results from telemetry and review:**

**DIYEboard 75Kv (65Kv real)**

![DIYEboard|280x500](upload://jXbYGm5hUWJ9lo95lhaSkxExra3.png)
![vescmonitor|281x500](upload://zBcHDAhvkNU5NWll16jQsdu38NE.jpg)


**MAD 130Kv (110Kv real) Hubs**

![vescmonitor|281x500](upload://25DfI55QfXzvxN98z9RVg2mUCA0.png)
![MAD%20130Kv%20telemtry|281x500](upload://6jI6aX3UyonZhHGJ9ThI5xN20Dy.jpg)


**Overall results 130Kv MAD hubs Vs 75Kv DIYEboard**

**Pro:**
-	**Coasting capability**. The MAD hubs surprised me for the free wheels experience. Don’t get me wrong also the other hubs roll well, but these ones do it better. Basically you can accelerate and then coast for longer than the other. Same thing if you push them as normal skateboard, I would say you feel 1/3 of the resistance compare the others. Really like this aspect.
-	**Ride smoothness**. One of the aspect that I judged as a problem at the begging was the 90A PU used. It actually turned out be way better than the other hubs with softer PU (I think 80A). Probably because the MAD hubs have 15mm PU thickness. Anyhow what matter is that I feel way less the bad roads. If I need to rate the difference I would say 3 times better compare to the other hubs (they are not famous for ride smoothness ). Of course full urethane will always be better in absorbing vibrations, but I can really live with that with these hubs.
-	**Power output**. Both from riding feelings and telemetry data the MAD hubs are more powerful than the others. They easy output 1800watt (total from 2 hubs) compare to 1200-1300 watt of the DIYEboard hubs on hard acceleration. Although I could reach up to 1600watt few times on hard acceleration up hills. Of course the two hubs have different Kv, so would have been better to use the same Kv for both the motors. Anyhow overall the DIYEboard wins over the MAD 130Kv hubs for the takeoff up to let’s say 10-15kmh (this DIYEboard 75Kv surprise everyone for the instant torque). So let say in a drag race, after the first 15 meters there is no chance anymore for the DIYEboard ones, really no game. Don’t get me wrong the MAD hubs pull too, it’s just that the motors are let say less efficient at really low rpm compare to 75Kv hubs. If you want instant torque, for an overall lower speed I am sure the MAD 75Kv version will be a blast. I would be really curious to try them out! Nevertheless I could climb all the hills in my city with no problem at all (more about hill climbing here https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-usa-group-buy-90mm-dual-hub-motors-75kv-or-130kv-dual-170-euro-3-to-go/62002/113?u=rey8801). 
 
-	**Top speed**. What to say…they fly, that’s it. Fun fact, to understand how much they can pull is that I never reach 95% of duty with these motors. Before I used to pull the throttle all the way up and you see from the telemetry the duty at 95% and then the motors amp, speed ecc increasing over time. With these motors I can reach at most 70-80% afterward my VESC setting limits the power. When you ride you do not feel it at all, but basically I easy reach all the battery and motor max limits. With that being said +50kmh easy, too easy maybe. Probably a bigger LiIon battery (10s4p or above, 12s…) or Lipo are better if you want release all the power. I think it’s already plenty though :rofl:.


**Cons:**
-	**VESC temperature**. This is actually the only issue I have experienced with them compare to the DIYEboard hubs. I guess is due to the difference in power and current drain. Of course depends how you ride, but if I do it hard the VESC temperature rises fast on my Maytech’s VESC. This can be solved limiting the max motor and battery settings. Basically to reduce the peak currents, but still keep nice top speed. 

![vescmonitor|281x500](upload://sTuLRTeY8GDj6VsYokZXhabxh8B.png)

A real heatsink , better VESC, or 12s will probably help too. Don’t get me wrong I use it every day, I don’t ride all the time at plus 50kmh :smile:. With 30Kmh average and some sprints not problem.

-	**Battery drain**. Same story, they ask more, if you push hard they drain more. Not surprise by that. Again if you ride in a more enjoyable way, same range of the others.


**Conclusions:**
I really like the MAD hubs and I am happy with them. I will definitely choose them over the DIYEboard ones. Which versions to choose? Good question, I guess if you plan to climb hills all the time the 75Kv is recommended. Unfortunately I couldn’t test it, but I guess they are the same motors, maybe even the only different between them is the delta and wye configuration, so you can always switch between them (130Kv / 1.73 = 75Kv). On the other hand if you want to have a freaking top speed and overall great power, than go for the 130Kv version, as I did. Of course, keep in mind the max ERPM limit of the 4.12 VESC. With a 130Kv you are at the limit with a 10s, out with a 12s. You can always limit the max ERPM in the VESC setting and moreover the only problem is during bench test, otherwise you need to go over 70kmh to encounter this problem! To make it short, don’t spin it fast on bench .:laughing:

Yeah.. thx Ray :wink: 

Red this topic last night all drooling about the 130kV hubs that Rey has been shredding hard lately, felt kinda conflicted with my still-coming 35kph board and those 50kph speeds here but then I recalled I had an experiemntal idea to, well to cast my own normal wheels anyway, but had an experiemantal idea to take a mould from similar but bigger 115mm or so offroad/smooth RC car wheels instead with what extra size I could get the same speeds, but would the torque curve be similiar for 65kV's like Ray described the 130s to be? I mean they probably have same much copper beef, same price range and also same many poles, they (Maytech) have 65kV and 130kV hubs Both available. Anyhow, just a night itch, a showerthought that maybe we 65kV fellas could get best of both worlds, so do speak, altho with hideous big wheels. tho they roll better over stuff<:P

If you are going to make bigger wheels for sure stay in the range 75Kv range is better. You will gain speed but still having nice torque. Of course the torque is gonna decrease. I couldn't try these hub motors is 75Kv configuration. I contacted people that used it in 10s and 12s and they say that are really really strong. I believe it since mine are already crazy

I know that most of the people don't care too much about hub motors, but if you like the stealth look and sound is a problem for you (catching attention from Police) then hub are perfect. I tried belt drive system and these how I called Mad hubs really go strong really strong. They are in the same price range of Maytech because come from the factory. The real retail price was double

Hi! They come hubs only. Then you need to fit them on the truck. I will post a how to do guide, with pics, but basically you need Paris style truck or other truck and you modify the hanger end. You make two drills and screw them on.
For the Kv version depends what you want. I tested 130Kv (110Kv in reality) with 10s3p. I found my battery be the limit of my setup because I couldn't use the whole power of the hubs before hit the limits set in the VESC tool. You don't feel when riding but I could go 80-85% max duty, with a 10s4p they will be even stronger which is crazy since they already have plenty of power. To make it short of you want super torque go with the 75Kv version, I couldn't test it, but people that did it said that is super powerful. You will have top speed around 40kmh, I guess. If you want more speed, you will lose a bit of torque but gain a lot of speed with the 130Kv version. As I wrote in the review, I compared them with the DIYeboard hubs 75Kv and the lower Kv wins a only in the first 10kmh when you start from stand still, after that no game. Other aspect that is worth it to mention is the low free wheel resistance, really pleasant to push and the thicker PU that absorbs way better vibration than the other hubs. That's a summary. More in the review.

Total is 170Euro at my place (custom ecc included). Then depends where you live is 20-30 euro shipping or come and pick it up. You can also suggest another shipping method, no problem :grin:

YEh that was the plan from the beginning, a direct comparison from a more known hub and these ones being too expensive to give them a try. The only missing part is to try the 75Kv version with the same setup, which I believe moves the whole power towards lower erpm, so it should be really fun. For that I only have feedback from people that used in 10s and 12s. I do not about the top speed, I guess it is  what we aspect from a 75Kv motor, but they told me that the torque is really really strong. Unfortunately no telemetry available :sweat_smile:. Concerning the pictures, I already posted the one for the MAD hubs, now the only motors I have are on my board and with loctite, so I am not planning to open it any soon. If the GB will happen, I can maybe do it later, with the permission of the owner of course. Anyhow the stator size is comparable to a 6355 motor, while if you check an open Meepo hub it looks smaller, for sure shorter than this one. The design of the motor can takes more space https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sZe1fZkIm8&t=207s![DIYEboard%20Hub|690x427](upload://eYQGyFYwg9dQUYc7JOexKA1wQXd.jpg). If I have the chance I will open the DIYEboard hub.

I already got a set of these directly from factory, shame because I would totally join in the GB otherwise.

Got 130KV and my first impressions are the similar as yours @rey8801. 

What I've noticed while taking them apart its that he outside screws holding the PU are M4x12mm and you can very easily over tighten them  so that they will touch the stator and potentially make pretty huge mess there. So be careful. I've replaced them with 10mm length.

Also, it was incredibly hard to put everything back in together, but maybe I was doing something wrong :)

Mine came without any threadlocker anywhere as well. Did you put any on those outside screws? I haven't yet, kind of worried that it doesn't leak inside the motor...

Nice to hear some else has them. Yes I noticed that front screw can almost touch the stator when I was checking the motor can alone. I just paid attention to don't screw them to much. I applied thread locker in any screws. They come without. Actually better so you inspect the motor. Yes put back the motor is a pain due to the magnets but I have already done in the past so I knew it. For the front screw just apply loctite on the side and screw them horizontally and let them dry upside down so you will be good :wink: one question, which configuration are you using them? Did you also notice a higher battery consumption?

I actually did over tighten them and everything was looking fine _until_ I mounted and secured the motor on the axle which made the motor block. I've noticed it right away fortunately and replaced the screws with 10mm ones, like I said just to feel safer.

Haha, I also had the same idea of mounting the screws while the motor is upside down and will probably do it that way and try not to overdose on loctite.

Just testing the motors for now, I'm using 8S LiPo, my standard configuration. But to tell you the truth I haven't done any metrics just yet. This board for now is a side project as I don't have much free time and I need to keep it under wraps so my wife wouldn't kill me knowing I'm building "another one" xD Shhhh!

Just a quick comparison of Maytech 65kV 85mm hubs. The stator amination dimesnions are 31x52mm. The magnets are 2mm thick. Nice touch of embedding the Hall sensors into the laminations

Good that you open it up. Yeh I didn't measure the stator, but on the datasheet it say 53*30mm so pretty much the same. Also the magnets distribution seems really similar, although a bit thicker maybe on MAD hub. MAybe I am wrong.

## \#139 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2018-08-23T20:37:29.690Z Reads: 170

```
The stator size is similar. People compare the 6355 dual belt drive to the torque of the diyeboard hubs. Of course then the belt will go fast than those hubs. I think that the MAD hubs will have more torque of the DIYeboard since they deliver more power than the my DIYeboard hubs. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of reviews out there. Few people contact me and one said that in 12s beat a way more famous hub board :wink: Of course the choice is yours, but if you are afraid that they won't deliver enough torque, I am sure they will.

I'm sure that it will be more than enough for me. I'm just looking at it from economic site and it seems that those hubs are way cheaper than dual belt drive. So unless you want to go with crazy power this is the way to go.
Only the urethane is a last drawback imo.

Well I get your point. From my point of view it's not only about economic. These hubs are in the low price range because of the GB otherwise they were way more expensive. I am sorry that I couldn't try the 75Kv version otherwise I could answer you more in details. Anyhow for the full urethane you are right. Hub motor can not be the same of full PU. On this point I can tell you that they are 3 times better than DIYeboard, koowheel hubs in damping vibrations.

After we have done with the GB I will post the how to do guide. To be honest I didn't measure the inner diameter. I can tell you that with the clone truck I had to remove let say 0.5mm (basically the black paint) around the last 2cm of the hanger to get a tight fit. I have seen people mount them on original Paris truck without grind them so I guess that is the diameter that you need. In m case I went carefully and stopped when the snap fit was reached. In my opinion if you need to modify the truck is better do it with the actual motor next to it.

Ok guys, I think we can close the GB! I got reply from the company and they accepted the order even if we didn't reach the threshold. I could still get the same deal, so not bad! I specifically asked to pay via PayPal. Although they do not like it, because of the additional fees, they agreed if we pay the fees which brings the total price for two hubs to 173Euro instead of 170Euro (202.4$). Not a big deal, but I think good in order to use PayPal.
Unfortunately they ran out of PU wheels, so they do not have it at the moment but we can make an order later on if someone need them. I used every day and since they are 90A, I guess you will be fine for long time,  anyway you can also find them here, thanks @LukePL https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Replaceable-hub-motor-wheels-for-63mm-hub-motor-83mm-52mm-90A/1987363_32791293254.html?spm=2114.12010615.8148356.41.550663aeVkPfJH. Only the black ones are 90mm, don't buy the orange or blue ones.
Good news, they get the single trucks in stock so if you need the hubs with the rear truck they will give it for 10 Euro more (11.7$). Be aware that it is the same clone truck I used, it's fine, but is not the original Paris truck of course. With the hubs installed they are 285mm.
I will start collecting the money for the goods only. Then a second payment will be made later on to cover the shipping cost to you ecc, since that part is gonna be slightly different for everyone. I wanted to receive all the payments via PayPal, but I read that PayPal will hold your money if you all pay like take. So I thought I can give different options:

- PayPal good and service (you pay the service cost, so please add 6 $ on top of it, used this calculator, usually is mostly correct https://www.clothnappytree.com/ppcalculator/). Only few people, otherwise it will hold your money.
- PayPal friends and Family. No limits and no additional cost.
To PayPal please send it in USD. Easy for the payment.

- Transferwise. Normal bank transfer (I am trying to link my US account to PayPal otherwise I will have conversion fees to pay).

I will send a group pm with the PayPal and Transferwise details. Once paid, send me a pm with your order and the name on the transfer.

Summary:
- 202.4$ Dual hubs
- 11.7$ rear Pars style Truck
- Optional PayPal good and service 6$ (only if you use it)

Confirmed:
@lockeboss 2 x 130Kv / 2 spare PU
@Andy87 2 x 130Kv / 2 spare PU
@LukePL 2 x 75Kv
@Aceofspace11 2 x 75Kv

**How to Install the MAD hubs**

Hubs require a Paris Style truck or whatever truck with a similar end hanger shape. The collar takes the last 2cm of the hanger. For this guide I used Paris clone truck 205mm model, but I advise to get the 150mm model since the hubs will add 3cm on each side and therefore you can pair it with a front 180mm to get the same width between front and rear trucks. Other option would be 180mm rear and 205mm front for 295mm or 195 front for 285mm.

![hub6|690x387](upload://7YEmhdArmIcVxj4DTLHNG0tgEqL.jpg)


The hubs come without Loctite, or at least mine was like that. Which is good because I was going to add it anyway just to be sure.
-	First thing try to mount the motor to the truck. In my case the hanger was slightly wider (half mm) so I proceed with grind it down a bit. Before do that you will notice that the motor phase wires and the hall sensors run in the middle of the collar which goes in contact with the hanger. I didn’t like the idea of having the truck applying pressure on them so I started with making on side of the hanger flat. Remember that you will need the last 2cm only. I opted to mount the motor with the wires facing the board, so I made the hanger flat at the bottom. Make sure you decide how to mount them before start. I suggest to proceed gradually and test it now and then. Once you think the motor wires have enough space, then check whether the collar already fits the hanger. In my case It didn’t so I proceed with removing a bit of diameter. Also here, better to do it in more steps in order to get a really tight fit.
![IMG_20180813_152925|281x500](upload://6SxPCyuD1WLQOyNaZbGGfI43Go0.jpg)
![IMG_20180813_153843|690x388](upload://jjhvgsS4dJqiRyCwzTVJrgBqD3C.jpg)![IMG_20180813_153829|690x388](upload://froa6U4WLovLsEuY3yfjybiCPgJ.jpg)![IMG_20180813_153821|690x388](upload://zprjDmWjvpr1BSeztPXsUedV0MD.jpg)

-	Once the motor slides on the hanger you can now proceed with making the holes on it. The motor comes with a M4 x 10-12mm screw which is too long. You will need 2 M4x6-8mm each motor. 6mm if you don’t use the lock washer (totally optional, don’t think is needed). I used a column drilling machine for the holes, to be sure I make them straight. You need to drill 5mm deep in the hanger, just above the axle, on both of the side. First install the motor without screw. When you get a position that you like, with the motor wires at the level of the flat part, use something to mark the hanger with the position of the first hole (small screw, needle ecc…). I then removed the hanger from the base plate because helped me for drilling the holes. For the drill tip I ran some test and 3.8mm gives really tight fit, that the m4 screw makes a bit of thread inside the hole. 3.9mm won’t make the thread but still tight fit, I used 3.9mm but next time I will use 3.8mm. Set your drill and make sure you are going to drill in the center of the collar hole, when you are sure remove the motor and make the hole (5mm not more!). Probably you know but you need to drill at low speed for metal, if you go too fast it will just heat up and breaks the tip.
![IMG_20180813_154629|281x500](upload://P9QysqneKL1LGcv8baK8Mhv913.jpg)

-	 Once the first hole is done install the motor and place the screw. Now you can mark the second hole from the other side and repeat the previous step.
![IMG_20180813_154641|281x500](upload://bNtEESw4S9WnWe4U1tjGKhKlelq.jpg)

-	One side is done you can move to the other.

![IMG_20180813_155409|690x388](upload://grmgt0CVl5ygRp8DmYXmncmtJkJ.jpg)
![IMG_20180813_151913|690x388](upload://79O91oasZEzITbGIckacukVlOf8.jpg)

-	Once you have done with the 4 holes, you can now paint the hanger and in my case also the screws :rofl: Totally optional of course.

![IMG_20180813_162854|690x388](upload://yp3vHA5Sa4VymccO8NRwsuJnthX.jpg)!
![IMG_20180813_162900|690x388](upload://kFRgeVLwpopMTVCBoAXqwoLCWmJ.jpg)!
![IMG_20180813_190638|690x388](upload://7f0zDoeY1aYvUiAbL112KjNDCXa.jpg)

-	At the mean time you can apply Loctite on each screws. For the motor CAN screws remove it one at the time, apply Loctite and put it back, I screwed half turn more than the limit. Repeat this passage for each screws following a star alternating pattern.
![IMG_20180813_161058|690x388](upload://h4Ads5IOX6X9QLh6KSA2NfVhfRq.jpg)

-	For the front screws you are gonna get the new hub model with different ring, but the principle is the same. Here do not tight too much and pay attention to don’t get Loctite inside the CAN. The screws are rather long and if you go too dip you will hit the stator.
-	Now mount the motors on the hanger ( I added Kapton tape between the motor wires and the hanger) and apply Loctite to the collar screws and that’s it!

![IMG_20180813_225407|690x388](upload://gHCf74lBs8T6YuFww29gBKkgdj4.jpg) 
-	The motor are ready. Next step depends what you use as connector and if you want to use them sensored.

![IMG_20180811_143633|281x500](upload://pJOmY15OXv7UMWTRpyj3CQ6BOqK.jpg)!

-	If you want to use them sensored then you need to replace the JST 6 pins ZH with a PH. The order is the one shown in the picture. Where red is 5V, black is GND and the rest doesn’t matter. Just remember to skip the temperature pin since the motors don’t have the temp sensor. You can also buy a ZH to PH adapter, but to me it's better  to replace it.

![IMG_20180813_220323|281x500](upload://1IFTyjVc2OY19YdOWN8Hiqag50o.jpg)
-	For the phase wires make them compatible with your VESC. I have 5.5mm on mine so I replace the 4mm connectors with 5.5mm. DONE!

![IMG_20180815_123501|690x388](upload://hfiR5x731barCTFKdPcivsmItf1.jpg)![IMG_20180815_123533|690x388](upload://5IZsPBHlvfA3gnGKphrqrP9NbTY.jpg)![IMG_20180815_121336|690x388](upload://aXdS1RIq6gbv3xtC5RstokxisBs.jpg)

Sorry if I explained to much, also obvious steps, but I wanted to be sure to cover all the possible tricky parts. If you have questions, just ask :wink:. I made the guide so that everyone can do it by yourself (DIY), but in case someone wants me to do it I can offer a “Plug and Play” package at 35 euro for dual set including:
-	Install the motors on the hubs as describes (grind, paint, Loctite, hardware)
-	Make the hubs VESC friendly (bullet, JST connectors)

Only VESC friendly option, would be hardware cost + 4 Euro for soldering job (total for both the hubs). 

Differently who needs hardware like JST, bullet connectors I have some (for dual set):
-	Bullet connectors (6 units male/female) 6 euro.
-	JST 6 pins + wires (2 units) 2 euro.

I hope it helps!

Check my Avenger build log. You can even download my enclosure from thingiverse and use it as mold. Anyhow I have 5cm from ground in the lowest point of the enclosure. I could make it smaller but I used a big bms at the time, plus was my first enclosure and I was scared that could fit everything. The Spud is perfect for me but it's short so not that much space underneath. When someone will make the spud with a kicktail then is the perfect commuter deck.

The holes is the way I used to mount them. They don't come with. Originally just the screw keep them installed on the hanger but I won't trust with out the holes.

Hey,

Can you please elaborate on mounting these on regular 150mm Paris v2 trucks ? On your pic it seems to eat a good 45mm from the side (your first pic is a 200mm clone hanger right?).

I'm trying to determine if I can use them with mines and if it can be straightforward mount (just drill holes).

Does it necessarily adds 3cm on each side ?

Edit : BTW how are the hubs holding up?

Hi! Sure. I will paste a post from the GB pm. The motors we ordered come with 180mm clone paris truck (picture below) and you can see the total length. You can mount them on 150mm Paris truck , no problem they will be 270mm instead of 300mm as for 180mm hanger. The hub collar takes 21mm of the hanger , but you have noticed that they come with a little axle extension to secure them from the other side. That's why they are wider than same truck with normal wheels. Below you find how to pair them in front.

Definetely they come with the 180mm hanger. And they actually measure 301mm.  My front with 205mm hanger reaches 295mm. So with a 150mm back you should get 271mm total. So front 180mm is actually the same 270mm. With 195 is gonna be 285mm front. I think now it's correct, please double check because it was a long day"

Hubs are running strong. I am now getting also the 75Kv version since I broke the BMS and now after ship out all the motors I will make a 12s battery with the 75Kv. Power! :laughing:

Actually yes since one guy joined at the end of the GB and I gave him my 75Kv pair. So I order another one but he got in the next batch. They said that I can add extra set but I have to tell them asap because they have to make it. Since is only one set extra the price would be 10 euro more for motor so 190 Euro for the dual set. If someone else wants to join then the price can drop a bit. 190 is already way less than the retail price but we already order some sets so now we have special price I believe. Let me know.
Ah it's gonna be ship the 7th of October. That what they said for my set.

[/quote]

EDIT THIS IS INCORRECT This doesn't make sense. at 10s we can run 200kv comfortably, staying under the 60k limit. At 12s on 200kv we're starting to get uncomfortably close. 130kv should be well well under erpm limits for 10s or even 12s.

When I ask this im really not trying to rip on the motors, but do you think theres an area on the temp/efficiency curve for these motors thats just..... incredibly inefficient?  I had the v2s from torqueboards and they got me up to insane speeds and had plenty of torque.

I only wonder because it seems visnu777 s ride hogged energy.... and my space cell pro 4 got easily less than 10 fast miles before the motors really sucked all the life out

Just wondering what your thoughts are on it

obviously there are ways to avoid it, learning to ride an esk8 efficiently is half the battle to a long battery life :laughing:


clearly heat is an issue, and im no scientist but what hummie says about saturating the stator with energy and heat until its no longer in its optimal operating temp really taxes energy seems pretty sensible. could these benefit from a special hanger for dissipation?

I am not here to defend the motors neither. I was looking for a nice hub motors and I organised that to get it, that's it. AS I wrote in the review I tested the 130Kv version and in that case to have a nice torque I had to set them high. As result great performance but my battery was drained fast and the vesc was getting hot. I found that for every day ride a more conservative setting that allowed me to go way further and keep the vesc temp around 50-60^C. OF course you sacrify a bit of torque but still capable of hills and reach above 50kmh. That's why I am getting the 75Kv too and used them in 12s to see if I can the best of the two worlds.

not really, the parts needed are the same. You can make it irreversible but you need to machine parts as well. I asked how much to produce like 25 sets of parts, so 25 drive trains... too expensive with out a demand. To test it out with one sample only would cost me 400$, so I am machine them by myself to save a bit. I am stubborn, I want to finish my initial plan :laughing:

Well to be honest I am always open to test new parts, but really I do not see how is possible to make a DD wit hcustomized parts, becsause are not available out there and charge only 90$. I mean, you would need 1000 sets made to lower the price to that point. Plus for instance these motor will never cost that low to allow to get all the parts together for 90$. I will do my best to finish it. If the conversion kit doesn't work I will need to machine new trucks. Not really looking forward for it. Although in that way would be more expensive but way faster to make it.

Since our message thing is closed:

Hmm, i just found this http://forum.seemecnc.com/viewtopic.php?t=7306#p58561 thread, they basically say that Nylon has no glassing temperature, it is very stable up to 200°C which would be perfect for us. I think its better to use some kind of plastic since it insulates the motor from the pu, at least a bit. A metal/aluminium core like the diyeboard hubs might just be good for giving a place you can glue it to but it should just transport the heat to the pu. I’ll try something with the Nylon filament i have :slight_smile:

I'm not sure if its necessary. When you glue or bond it somehow to the PU it should have lots of strength. If you print it in vase mode and an 1mm nozzle it should be pretty strong when glued to the pu. I guess we have to find out :) I'll print what I have in mind and glue it in one of the widened pus :)

i bought the original paris 150mm trucks and mine swaped on easy yesterday.
Just drilled the holes for the screws, but no need to work on the hanger.

Yeh with the original and also the clone one they slide on. Only my first clone truck that I bought separately needed a bit of modification. But not that much.

I had a lot of fun with those hubs today! Just did a quick test run on duct tape build just to test it :smiley:![IMG_20181010_165122_HDR|666x500](upload://khFClQJVQx9pm5Bj20DPGmcqPzu.jpeg) ![IMG_20181010_142659_HDR|666x500](upload://s2psUUTHvzV0klyXOHsMMsUWUAZ.jpeg)

Good man! I am happy of that. I am building the battery now. I hope to be ready before the winter comes. Nice on the Ronin. maybe for aesthetic and better lock of the screw, change them to a short one like M4 6-8mm is what I use. I told at the guy to do not send them with the long screws on the collar. It doesn't make sense.

Yeah thank you once again @rey8801 :) Now I have to focus on my battery also and my deck. After that I'll try to convert those to DD because having Popocas at front and see how big of a difference they make it's the only way for me to be perfect happy ;)

It's not difficult that difficult to convert them to DD. That's why I chose these hubs first.

I did't have any issues. I used this ebay ESC so it was not a challenge for them. They just got hot but I could easily touch every part. I can compare them only to Banggood cheap hubs which are getting so hot that you can't touch axles and when you put a drop of water on them you can hear psssssst :D. Also those cheap hubs are way less efficient. I was using 10s2p battery and nearly the same time of riding I had still 50% with MAD hubs and it would be empty with the cheap ones. Can't wait to feed them through my ESCapes :D

Yeh I testede several hubs and I would put the MAD hubs just after the diyeboard Meepo style first model (not replaceable wheel). The later were better in dissipatin heat or probably also in creating heat, but of course they also ask half of the current with the same settings compare to the MAD. Een after push them hard for 8-10km with the 130Kv I was still able to touch them, yes they were hot, but still possible.
When you will switch to a VESC you fell the difference.

I am only talking about heat not performance. If you read my review is all written.
The new motor Enertion is making looks legit. Nice
I am pretty sure the Meepo one are even cooler than hummies and Enertion simple because they have less power.

Hi ! I'm a novice at this so I do apologize if I'm being ignorant , I was planing to do a build 4x4 on a trampa mountain board so I can jump with it and go on any terrain including on not so steep mountain paths. I love the 4x4 idea as you can customize the acceleration and braking also I was thinking that the 4x4 even if it has hubs it should still be able to handle some steep climbs. As for the wheels I was wondering if something like this would do http://www.diyeboard.com/images/s/201709/15048848343.jpg 
I've read the discussion and from what I can understand so far these MAD hubs are pretty good.
Am I unaware of some really serious challenges or is this project of mine doable?

Hi! In your case probably 4 75kv would be the best combination. Problem with current design that there are no plug and play wheels that you can add on them. In general if you want to adapt a generetic hub motor you can either make you custom mold like @visnu777 did or convert them to direct drive and then use whatever skate wheels you want. I am converting them to direct drive right now but it's a custom made project. Otherwise looks to the backfire ranger, skull board hubs. They are using bigger hub motors. Don't know about power thought.

I was thinking the same thing but I think I'll go for a custom mold.

When are you going to order again?

Yeh, single set is too expensive. So only in case there is at least 8 sets demand I think it is worth it. I am not sure when we will run another group buy at the moment, sorry :sweat_smile:

I just realized how messed up your windings look @rey8801.... You don't feel anything strange while riding?

I think those are just normal winding when you hop to the next arm. you can see the same things under the 2 you circled.

No this is normal I thing. You have 2 classic la configuration delta and wye. Most of the motor a re delta were basically you have 6 wires coming out the stator, with actually 3 phases. In the delta configuration you want to connect a wire from a phase to the other... Well a pictures makes everything easier to understand.
![MotorDeltaWye4|560x500](upload://wfjqFNHZdEzqqYX9nGmnym0act1.png) 
Delta is the one on the left.

So the winding you circled in the picture is just the one that goes to the tiger side to connect with the other wires group to make one of the final motor phase wire. 

I recently whatched some tutorial about winding a brushless motor and it's quite  logic. Once understood the mechanism it's fairly easy. For instance a fast modification that 6o7 can do is switch between delta to wye or stars configuration. You will lower your Kv of 1.75 factor. Meaning that Y if you have 130Kv motors and decide to go lower then you will get 75Kv.

It's around 30mm but you have to use it with this inner part.

I have only one because guy who machined it for me fucked up 3 of them until he made this one which is not perfect either.
