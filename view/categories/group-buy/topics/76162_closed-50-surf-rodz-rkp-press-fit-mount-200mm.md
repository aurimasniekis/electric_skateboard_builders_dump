Guys I am running a **small** group buy for some CNC press fit mounts for SR RKP 200mm hanger trucks. 

The plan is just for 10 sets. Maybe a little more if there is interest but I don't want it become too much work. Its 2pc per set, left and right. I just want to get them done for myself and reduce the financial risk to me. Also I don't need 10 sets but the price is way better than 1 set. 

The design is already confirmed to work. It fits like a glove. Tested with SLA 3D printed mounts. 

The design had two main goals, easy to machine and fit with 70mm axles. To fit 70mm axles you need to run a pulley that slight goes over the end of the mount. Fatboy pulleys fit, and @dickyho with a bit of filling. Other pulleys should fit but you would need 80mm axles I think to space them out. 

Price for one set is **$50 usd delivered** by registered mail from Hong Kong. We have really good price on international postage here. Postage should be on average about $10 usd. 

- Material is 6061 Aluminium, raw finish. 
- Distance between motor plates is 168mm So XX80mm long motors fit. 


Sign up sheet here. We are already very close to my 5 set minimum so this should be a go.

If you have access to a really good 3D printer your can potentially print your own for cheap from my files on thingiverse. Though the CNC will be stronger and help heat sinking.

We reached the minimum of 5 sets, so you can send the money to my paypal now and I can get this going. I will get a final number on Friday and then get the CNC shop to start production. 
lukeritchiedesigns at gmail for paypal, leave a note in paypal with your username and quantity just to be sure I can track it.

[quote="Quiles, post:75, topic:30020, full:true"]
is it possible to anodize?
[/quote]
 
@Quiles  Yes possible but it would increase the cost for everyone and take an extra week or so to process. My goal with these was minimal cost. Plus you really don't see much of the mount once its installed. See red circles below.

![image|690x494](upload://mHvYTSFr13L9Kc5rOHyiUL5umkU.jpeg) 

I will check the cost out of interest though.

That wonâ€™t work, tb218 trucks are not precision trucks, so you wonâ€™t be able to make a press fit mount unless you measure the truck and cut your own mount or lathe down the truck and make a mount for the new profile

It could kinda work, the left / right sides are fairly accurate but the top / bottom can be plus minus 1.5mm. Might need a little filing for installation. 

Donâ€™t the fatboy gear drives press onto TB218?

I sent the money to the factory for 15 sets. They say it will  take 7 - 10 days but I think that is just standard answer. It is pretty simple part so hoping for about 7 days. There will be a couple sets spare if no one pulls out. 

For the remaining guys not yet paid I hope you can soon.

My dude, ready to pay.

I re-read the thread, it says $50 including shipping but mentions $10 post.

Also not sure on what currency to send, F&F which I would be inclined to use for a long standing member doing something nice for the community for nada is only possible sending Euros for a Euro PP account.

i.e. Is this right?

![image|473x173](upload://zbaCUYLDPF4LkBpVmQkys5yDd7A.png) 

Or this

Also, forgot to ask the other day but is it too late to have mine done with the whole for marc88's motor plate cause I already have a set of those mounts and could use them for these.

Thanks so much!

Got an update, factory says they will be done around the 15th which is saturday, then I should receive about mid next week. 

I will have to start collecting your mailing address soon if I don't have it in paypal. Maybe just PM me if that is the case.

Mounts came in today. And I confirmed they fit. I was having a bit of anxiety that somehow I overlooked something and they would not fit and I would have to refund everyone. But all is good! 

I will make a short installation guide when I get a moment.

Not sure but if someone could measure them with a caliper? 

The inside hole needs to be at least 29.5mm and the center to center of the M4 screws needs to be 46mm.  

Would be crazy if they did fit.

Ok I thought there was a problem with covering the grub screw but then remembered @mmaner suggested to use loctite instead. Overall good quality and precision is on point. It feels tight before fully pressed in. 

9.5 / 10 score. Only thing it can improve is anodized part and offers maybe 1 more different diameter hole pattern for other mounts.

100% recommend!!!!

Sweet what lock tight I guess the strongest.. green or red is okay.. I figured the grub is what held it from the forward and braking back forth agressive would slowly loosen the truck axel.. I always had to tighten mine once or twice a year with out motors.. but I never used red or green always blue. Cheers this just opened up bunch of options for precision trucks

[/quote]

I've used Caliber and Paris precision trucks, They cost twice as much (or more) than Surf Rodz and I like Surf Rodz more, a lot more.  SR TKP's are way more precise in the lean and SR RKP's are more stable at speed.  Honestly, SR trucks are about the cheapest precision trucks available, for esk8 they are arguably the best...so a good combo for us.

Guys I have been awal due to Xmas activities, not been near a computer in ages. Sorry, will send everyone their tracking numbers today. 

Also didnâ€™t expect anyone to get them already and have not made the installation guide yet. 

The main points are, 
- remove the grub screw. I filled the hole with hot glue to prevent water entry.
- the dot on the back of the mount goes on the grub screw side. Itâ€™s easy to install the wrong way if you donâ€™t check. 
- add just a little grease to the hanger if you want them to come off easier in the future. 
- press on with axel and a bunch of spacers.
```

If you use that stuff you will need heat to remove the axle which may be a bit of a pain and cause marring of the hanger etc

Time for install guide with pics. 

**1. Remove grub screws.** It may come back to haunt you in the future if you don't. At first I tried to just have the grub screwed in but down but it was just a tiny amount up and caught on the mount and made it very hard to remove. 

![image|690x498](upload://bcHBH5Bch0fNVXFnJjji7gJQxlJ.jpeg) 

I filled the hole with hot glue then cut the excess off with a box cutter. This keeps water out.

![Photo%20Dec%2019%2C%201%2026%2033%20PM|375x500](upload://3sASY4j9uoTKAn5OzJW786mPLYd.jpeg) 

Its worth doing if you ride in wet conditions often, or you could end up with a rusty mess like this!! By the way anyone know where to get 70mm stainless steel shoulder bolts?

![Photo%20Dec%2019%2C%201%2028%2030%20PM|375x500](upload://e8pZ4qeoqUxOAmdhUYb0n0jk2gx.jpeg) 

**2. Line up the dot with the grub screw hole.** If you miss this step there is a chance they will be mounted wrong as they look almost the same in both directions but the angles a bit different. Add a little grease to the hanger if you want an easier time removing them in the future. 
**2a. NOTE.** They have a left and right as the M4 threaded holes are slightly offset from the center line. This gives a better angle for the motor plate. If you got two sets try not to mix up the pairs. 

![image|465x500](upload://58Y4tL0qZ9ctcallRlTeDbmT5oQ.jpeg) 

**3. Press fit.** Use the axles with a bunch of spaces to press on, tighten them down fairly tight, but **DO NOT** over tighten. Just a bit more then you would tighten the wheel on should be enough. 

![Photo%20Dec%2019%2C%201%2038%2044%20PM|375x500](upload://kJTCrFXWnvLxKAnQgVuXuEMy11D.jpeg) 

If there is a small gap between the end of the hanger and the mount don't worry about it, its normal. 

![Photo%20Dec%2019%2C%201%2040%2005%20PM|375x500](upload://uE6t5xRoryG3acFQqXyxUMHrDo2.jpeg) 

Mine have been working perfect. No weird sounds, movement or screws loosening of M4 screws even with no loctite. (Still recommend loctite)

There is a small chamfer on the surfrodz and on my mount so all the way on will have visually about 1mm gap on the inside edges. 

So I think you got it all the way in. 

The mount is tight anyway so I would not worry about it. Just maybe check the tightness of your axles after a the first few rides incase it works its way up the hanger any.

The other thing to check is put your axle all the way in with no spacers, measure the unused part of the axle, then your spacers for compressing need to be at least 5mm longer to  prevent the axel bottoming out in the hanger while compressing the mount on.
```

Did you have to custom make those support bars? There should be 168mm between the motor plates. If your plates are parallel and 168mm between them, then the mounts must be fully seated. 

Man that setup looks so sturdy, should be super reliable. 

What is the center to center distance on these motor plates?

I am trying to get the Bergmeister Wheels and their pulleys to work.
Link to Pulley here: https://haggyboard.com/collections/drive-gears/products/60t-bergmeister-all-terrain-drive-gear-belt-combo-kit

Since their pulleys holds a bearing, it creates some alignment issues with the motor pulley and idlers (not in picture) thus the spacers.

I am hoping with 4 contact points and crossbars the mount would be strong enough with this janky setup.

The pulleys were also too big for marc88's motor mounts so I am putting a custom order in to get a longer version.

@XTLA i think so, just a little more complicated manage. I can ask them to not do the last few steps to do the holes. My original plan with the first round was to have an option for other or no hole options for people who want to make their own motor plates or a different plates. But everyone wanted marc88 plate holes. Its not hard to drill your own holes and tap them.

hey guys - just a warn. Today i was press-fitting the adaptor do the SR hangar (bullet 3 on installation guide). I overtighned the axle (as it was still missing 1mm to go in) and end up ***damaging*** the hanger inner threads and the axle .

More info on: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/info-surf-rodz-spacers-axles-bearings/68341/179

@lrdesigns - I think you should update the installation guide, so people don't use the axle to press-fit.

**The adaptor is great by-the-way**, i just posting this so people don't end-up doing the same thing as i did.

Using the axles to press fit the adapter is fine as long as you don't try to get rid of that tiny gap between the adapter and the hangar. AFAIK neither me nor @Winfly nor @sofu were able to close that gap using the axle to press it in.

AFAIK neither me nor @Winfly nor @sofu were able to close that gap using the axle to press it in

Yeah, I even went at it with a rubber mallet and damaged my *table*... so I think that gap is here to stay

Ordered one set.

From their description on the website: 

Completely assembled with RKP 200mm (10mm) Matte Red Hangers with 80mm axles, 45 Degree Matte Red Bases, and Hard Cone/Barrel Bushing Support Combo.

So I guess it will come with 45 degree base plate.

Dude! Sorry to hear that. Did not consider anyone would go full gorilla on it trying to close the gap. 

Yeah there is no need for the gap to be 100% closed other then OCD. I will put a warning on the instructions. 

I think part of the gap is an optical illusion caused by there being a chamfer on the SR hanger and on the mount. So even all way down you will still see a small gap.

Isn't this gap due to a chamfer on the internal edge of the hanger socket?
