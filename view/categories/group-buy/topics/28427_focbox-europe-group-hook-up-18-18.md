Planning on having a few of these in August - curious if any euro peeps are interested in purchasing - they will be cheaper as I'm buying in bulk and getting rid of import fees, cause i pick them up while in the states. Help give me a feel for how many I'm packing. 

Pre-sale warning here. Through the group buy there will be no vendor warranty. I will check these when I receive them to make sure they fire up. After that.......

Shooting for 115 each plus shipping from Spain and paypal fees.
 
Small first buy here just 18 units this first round.
Thus far 18 of 18 are spoken for. Well played gents. 

rpasichnyk - 2 PAID
Silverline - 2 + Canbus PAID
yaca -2 PAID
Gynpe - 1 PAID
Mikkiller - 1 PAID
Yecrtz -2 + canbus PAID
coolwhip - 1 PAID
pakue - 2 PAID
Peetaa - 1PAID
hornet90 - 1PAID
banjaxxed -1 PAID
Yoxcu - 1 PAID
Brandtisco - 1 PAID

No longer a waitlist: Second Group Buy in case you missed it.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/europe-focbox-round-2-speed-ball/29060?u=monkey32
 
 
AGAIN NO IMPORT TAX FOR EU BUYERS AND GROUP BUY DISCOUNT

Line starts here gentlemen.

Much love,
Hunter

Cool, i`m one of the lucky guys on the list :-P Thanks for doing this.

Btw. The cable between two focboxÃ¨s in a dual setup (the can bus cable i believe) do enertion sell them as well ? If yes, any change we could buy them together with the focbox ?

What's up gents,

I should be getting these while stateside and checking them. They will be shipped mid-late August when I'm back in Europe.

Oh yeah, let me know when where you will be Aug 20th- 26th so I can calculate the shipping costs.

Alright ladies and gents, couple follow up things:

1. How many of you would like to include canbus cables? I will be ordering a few sets for myself and can include them for 7 euros

2.  I will be calculating your totals tomorrow. I'll post here when I need you to pay and send private messages with the total.

3. The final order is being placed today. They should be to me within the week.

Alright ladies an gents.........I have been looking at shipping for these bad boys......it looks like an 7euros  for shipping as a low average. Rather than fuck around getting individual shipping I would like to just add 7 to everyone's total and call it good. This doesn't include the packaging I'm going to need to get, nor the shipping costs to get these to me - I will eat both these costs. If you would please send funds to

PayPal:
monkey32@uw.edu

Prices are as follows:

â‚¬122 friends and family single FOCBOX
â‚¬236 friends and family double FOCBOX
â‚¬245 friends and family doubleFOCBOX with canbus
â‚¬126 non friends and family single FOCBOX
â‚¬244 non friends and family double FOCBOX
â‚¬252 non friends and family double FOCBOX with canbus

I'll update the initial post with who has paid daily as I check my account. I'm gonna need funds sooner rather than later gents. Payment by midnight Alaska time the 30th of this month or I start passing off to the wait list. I love you guys but I ain't gonna be stuck with excess that I don't need.

Also please include note in your payment with your Forum names - thanks those that have already paid and done this.

Cheers gents,
```

## \#24 Posted by: Silverline Posted at: 2017-07-27T08:20:08.728Z Reads: 109

```
When you pay with paypal, and do not choose friends and family, there`s a "paypal fee" the receiver of the money pays out of the received money. Thats why the price is higher, if you choose to pay like this.

Hola kids,
So I have been working on payment/addresses this past week. I am working my way backwards through my PayPal account. Have no fear though this group will be shipped first. I won't be home for another week but if you all would please check that you have given me either through PM or as a note in your PayPal statement your forum name, real name and address it will help me organize my shipping. Cheers gents.

Hola ladies and Gents,

So after running around getting addresses and such together I have found that there have been a few mistakes .As all of you have paid, and  I want all of you to get your FOCBOX after this first initial shipping,  I have made a spreadsheet with your Forum name, last names, country of destination, Order, and a tracking number -

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10mxphAEBKF-l6THcR9KzhcmItzb2EjAxsgV7DgSmcls/edit?usp=sharing

 **Please double check that your forum name aligns with where I am sending these**. 
If you see a problem, or you are moving, get in touch with me via PM. 
If all looks good send a short message of confirmation in this thread.

I know I said I wanted to get these out today but I am going to wait until Monday to be on the safe side.

Thanks gents

I appologize for the one week difference in shipping.....but I think overall I'm running one of the better group buys in terms of communication and follow through. 

Here they are ready to ship

Gents ,
Kindly unwad your panties....
tracking numbers are updated now.

The phase wire plugs are smaller than 4mm -  3.5 (i didn't realize that was actually a size people used) for this i  do  apologize. 

I ended up losing ~65 euros  on this group buy as shipping ended up much more costly than I anticipated.......so in so far as you being disappointed really isn't something thats gonna keep me up at night

@yaca - I was clear and kept you up to date as to when I was shipping......you requested I ship knowing that it was last minute. sucks that your choice didn't pan out but it was just that........... your choice. I imagine you have an extra week of waiting and maybe another 10 euros of shipping .......still cheaper than if you bought this yourself by 20 euros or more.

Come on gentleman, I told you from the beginning that you could send it to the spanish address just if you can do it in time but you waited till tuesday the 29th. Maybe it's also just bad luck that the spanish post is so slow. I'm not in hurry, my parents in law soon will be in spain and they could bring it to me.

Hey kids,

I have a question. The connection for the senor motor on the FOCBOX labeled as SV, H3, H2, H1, T and GND (which I know are mislabeled) are they male JST HX 6 pins 1.5 mm? Cause that's what I think I'm seeing, but on my APS 170KV Motor my sensor plug is also male, 6 pins but it is smaller... Appears to be 10.1 mm, possibly 1 cm.

Can someone give me a hand with this? I'm trying to get a female plug to replace the one on my motor, but I'm not sure of the size on the FOCBOX.

No warranty I'm afraid. I'm a third layer vendor. I don't have original receipts from enertion and I'm sure it's more than 60 days since original purchase.

I use a receiver for each focbox. Works perfect..... On that way, they only share plus and minus.

Because i have read about so many people who has blown can-bus IC`s and or vesc, if the cable come loose.

This way all so gives me redundancy, and a little more safety, if one of the focboxes blows up.

Thereâ€™s only one rule to avoid this problem. Donâ€™t power a Single vesc connected to another one via CAN BUS. It will cause a short. Always make sure that both VESC are connected to the power when itâ€™s connected in CAN. And you will never have any problem.
