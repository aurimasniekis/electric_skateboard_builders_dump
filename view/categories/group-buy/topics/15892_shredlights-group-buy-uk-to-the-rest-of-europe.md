.....

Ok Ladies and Germs


Here's the deal.....

By Thursday a google doc will be created by Shreadlights....

You will put your order and all your mailing information in the doc and send your payment to me

Once all orders and Paynents are recieved ....Ill pay shreadlights 

shredlights has so graciously said they will send all of your orders direct....the only exception is Europe ... they will be sending your orders to their guy in the U.K. first...then to you 

......

PLEASE NOTE: Shredlights has asked me to limit the order to 50 Sets of two, so basically a 100 sets of lights (I hope that makes sense) The reason is the special pricing we were given and could upset thier Vendors....But this is one off deal to introduce their lights to the Esk8 community so this is will not be an on going deal.

One front and rear set for me plus extra brackets for board number 2.
Sounds like with 100sets total you'll need to start limiting the number of sets per person :D

Me and Eric are working on a form for you all to fill out...

As soon as it's ready you guys can have at it....

There a lot more people than I thought would be interested in this group buy....

I'll do my best to make sure all of the orders are filled... it is my hope that I won't need to limit the order per person....but the ultimate decision is up to Shredlights ... as always keep you all posted

Hi @Michaelinvegas , Many thanks for organizing this.

Just letting you know that I would also be interested in 1 set Headlights and 1 set Rearlights depending on shipping costs (I live in Switzerland). 

I'm also waiting for shredlights to tell me whether they are compatible with Evolve carbon GT trucks
Depending on the above I will fill in you Doc when it is ready

Hey, any idea if these would fit between my Carvon V2.5's and my flat deck without using spacers?

Also any guide on how to program these (on off, maybe even idicator lights) to control with my remote buttons or program braking lights?

Hey guys I did hear back ...

And yep...bad news ....

It's because of his agreement with his partner over there...and he wants to respect that...and I guess we have to as well....

I'm very sorry guys ...I did my very best....


(But you know me....I ain't done yet üòâ)

@Michaelinvegas 
No worries.
Do you know who his partner in europe is so we can check the standard prices in europe?

**EDIT**: Found this http://gravityhouse.co.uk/shredlights.html but they only ship within UK :persevere: Seems weird that Eric doesn't have a real .eu retailer.

Alternatively, a full kit with shipping to europe is $85 from Shredlights USA. Would Eric be willing to offer a promo code for this forums eu-members for a better price perhaps?

Maybe if we get the lights delivered to another country in EU, we will not have to deal with his promise to the UK vendor?

Sounds interesting! Yes, French shipping service is indeed cheap! At least a lot cheaper than Danish! I send a postcard last year from Val Thorens to Denmark - I only payed 1 ‚Ç¨ üòç
in Denmark the price would probably be around 4 ‚Ç¨!

Damn, that's cheap! Wish it was the same case in Denmark... Everything in Denmark spis just ridiculous expensive. For example, when bying a new car you have to pay taxes at the equivalent of 2.5 times the cars value! I will probably leave this hell of a country some day.
