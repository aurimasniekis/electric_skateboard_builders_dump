Are the caliber clone trucks for the pair or each?.....not clear from description.

Are you likely to have motors for sale regular or just on group buys?

Hey Mark,  motor mounts are solid.  They have exceptional ground clearance and fit super snug to the trucks.  They aren't going anywhere once you clamp them down.  These fit the SK3 6355 and the 6374. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6cdbdc18fd700d435bd0cf431ed3f24706c5cafd.jpg" width="690" height="388">

One piece mount means it's solid and fixed angle.  You can use 1/4 spacers on a 29 inch wheelbase and it will likely touch the deck if you max out your turn.  Because of this I use a 1/2 spacer and you don't come close to touching at a ridiculously tiny turn radius

Hello everyone theres a lot of demand and a lot of questions so let me start answering them

 [quote="SirDiff, post:19, topic:13419"]
10s3p battery. About the battery, is it possible to know the exact specs (amps of the bms, welding method etc) and have a switch and lcd voltage indicator on it?
[/quote]
[quote="Tuomalar, post:22, topic:13419"]
I'm also interested about battery. I need 10s4p, but want more info
[/quote]

Battery - Samsung 25R 18650 Cell

continuous discharge current: 20A. 
Safe pulse discharge ratings: 95A < 0.5 sec, 65A < 1 sec, 40A < 5 sec, 30A < 6 sec. 
Nominal capacity: 2500 mAh. 
Nominal voltage: 3.6 V.

So 10S = 36V and 10amp/h

Nickel Strip Spot Welding

77AMPS BMS - thats what i told the factory but honestly the factory can get whatever we need.

I can also have a LCD voltage indicator, but maybe not soldered on.

IF YOU WANT TO HELP WITH BATTERIES INFORMATION WITH LIKE DIAGRAMS IT CAN JUST MAKE MY LIFE EASIER. THIS IS BECAUSE I CAN SEND THE FACTORY THE FORM FACTOR OF THE PACK WITH THE SPEC OF THE PACK AND THATS ALL THEY NEED

[quote="r0ymanesco, post:27, topic:13419, full:true"]
What are the dimensions of the battery packs?
[/quote]

10S4P - 39.8x13.5 cm

If you want it to be smaller send a diagram :innocent:

[quote="Papperlapp, post:28, topic:13419, full:true"]

Yeah I think we need a little more informations about the batteries, buying batteries is always scary, especially if they're from unknown Chinese manufacturers (plus have you found out if it has a switch and if a led voltmeter could be added? ). Also, have you checked the dimensions of the trucks to see if they fit normal caliber mounts? I know @fedestanco had some problems

Hi, I would like to cancel the trucks and pulley. So I'll just be getting the following:

* 10s3p battery

* charger for the battery

* benchwheel remote

Thanks and sorry for changing it last minute, I hope it doesn't cause a major inconvenience

Can you also get 12S BMS + switch? 
And are Samsung 30Q Cells an option instead of 25R? 
And the absolute best would be a wider version of the caliber clone trucks. So that 2 6374 would fit inclusive 12 or 15 mm belts. Maybe you can ask the factory. I guess a couple of people would be interested in them.

2 x 19mm more for 6374 compared to 6355 = 38
2 x 6mm more for 15mm belts compared to 9 mm belts = 12
Total 50mm 

The size needs to be 50 mm wider in total to fit 6374 with 15mm belts. Maybe 48mm also would fit. 
What would be the price for the 12S BMS + switch and what would be the price for the 30Q cells?
And of course a charger that suits 12S would be necessary.

12S4P would be nice with 30Q. Batteries sideways so that it should be around 14 cm wide and 45 cm long. 
But anyway i need them a bit flexible because of my awesome titanium (seriousely) cruiser board. 
And i think the factory can only make them stiff. If you would be arranged lengtwise then the pack would get 14,4 cm wide (18mm * 8) and the connections between each pack could be done slithly flexible. But then the connection needs to be done always on the same side. So that each of the 12 packs are connected with the connection on the board side. But i think that would be too much stress for your factory. Or maybe you don't even get what i mean.

So more or less a 12S bms + switch for a low price and the wider trucks would be cool. And maybe you have a good price for the cells itself.

But the 30Q perform better at 20A as the 25R. Only problem is that they are officially rated to 15A. But they can do better.
Other cells for example are rated to 20A and perform badly. But the 30Q are the opposite. But anyway, there are only short seconds in reality where the full battery amps would be drawn from the battery.
For example at full speed on the flat you only draw around 20 amps in total from the battery at 50 km/h. 
Most people think that you would draw the max amps in this situation but it's not the truth. Don't want to go too much into detail but the 30Q in a 4P setup are for the street would be absolutely fine.
 
The continuous discharge rating means full amps from full charge till completely empty because then the battery heats up. In our use case that doesn't happen. You would need to gear the board to 80 till 90 km/h max speed and then do full speed all the time.

Hi there, 
if its not too late could I be put down for: (its quite a list)

VESC x 2
Right side motor mount x1
10S3P x 2
BMS x 2
charger x1
controller (mini) x1
Kegel 12mm pulleys & belts x1

Also 1 set of 90mm and 1 pair of trucks

And just to check, the 'Right' side is relative to direction of travel right?
and if possible could you tell me the teeth numbers or mechanical ratio of the pulley set?
Sorry if its too much XD, 
also be kind enough to _tell_ me if i'm being an idiot!

Seems weird that dampfakkus has differing information about the 25R.
Your graph makes them seem worse than in their other graph.

http://www.dampfakkus.de/akkutest.php?id=559

Comparison of blue and green version of the 25Rs at 20A discharge. See how they only drop below 3.3V after ~950mAh. In your graph that happens already at ~820mAh.

The 30Q does not look as good in this one (reaches 3.3V after just 900mAh). Source: http://ukvapers.org/Thread-Highest-capacity-18650-Battery?pid=1365701#pid1365701

Also please keep in mind that the 30Q could change its characteristics between batches as it is only "required" to deliver 15A with its rating. I have to admit though: right now I feel like I should have gone for 30Q instead of 25Rs.

I wanted to ask how much would cost the 10s4p battery wit lg he2?
Would you prefer the samsung 25r befor the lgs ? Are the lgs worth the extra costs?

I would like to order:

2 x 10s4p battery pack complete with bms, switch and lcd voltage indicator display  (i will decide until tomorrow which cells maybe u can help me with the decision 😀)

2 x charger

2 x a set of black 90mm flywheels

1 x a set of caliber trucks black

2 x motor pulley 14T 12mm

2 x motor pulley 15 T 12mm

4 x 12mm belts

So you are mailing when u want the payment? (i guess with paypal?)
When you think everything is going to be shipped?

I'll let you know by tonight if i'm in or not.

Alright I'm very much motivated to participate in the group buy, but as a complete and utter newbie I have a lot of questions, I hope you guys can help me:

- Are the bearings included?
- The batteries seem super expensive, are they worth the extra cash compared to, say, two of those for 50 USD total https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html
- If so, which one of the two offered here do you recommend? And do I need one or two for the average 10 mile range?
- How important is the anti spark switch? The few tutorials I read about e-skates never mentioned it!
- What's the difference between the two motors?

Apart from that, I'd be in for basically all of it (Black 83 Wheels, trucks, one of the batteries, charger, BMS, Motor Mount, VESC, Mini controller, one of the two pulley kits, and one of the motors)

Cheers!

You need 6 of those lipos to get 9s with 10000mah and that 10s4p is 10000mah and 3p is 7500. 

But at first by reading this forum you'll get answers of all those guestions.

There is no such a thing as "stupid question", but every day here comes new members and ask those same questions, so...  

But short answer. Difference between those motors is their size. If you do singledrive buy bigger one (6374 under 200kv) and with 10s3p pack.

And I burned one esc, because I didn't use antispark.

Hello mate, welcome. I'll try give you a brief rundown that should give you just enough info to make a decision but not as much as you'll get from having a good read. 

First: Bearings wont be included. Coming from a skate background myself i'm perfectly happy with a set of bones reds for cheap but i'm sure people will preach about £100 ceramic bearings and so on til the end of days. 

What you're comparing two different types of batteries. The ones here are a much higher quality, can be made into a customised shape cell, will last longer, and are just plain better. You pay for it though. I'd suggest you to be fine without these, and as you suggested get the LiPos. Be careful - easy to break/not charge properly. But they work perfectly fine. You would need two though as you say, but in series. 6s is really a minimum - 3s wouldnt get you up to speed! two of them in series as a rule of thumb would get you 5 miles at 6s. 

Anti Spark is a safety thing. Could damage a number of components with a spark, an anti spark obviously mitigates that risk. Probs for the best to have one in the circuit but truth be told if you're lucky you wont have any issues :pray:

I really dont wanna scroll up to check the motor spec but usally the difference in motors is the kv value, in which case read up on what kv is better for your needs, it hinges on what torque you need and what batteries you're going to use. The other difference is size. In a single motor set up, generally get the biggest available  (usually 63mm). in a dual motor set up, because you have two taking the load instead of one,and you might want them side by side, smaller is best.

Hope that helps mate. Don't be put off, but make sure you know what you need :)

Yeah man,  no disrespect and questions aren't dumb, sorry if it came off too aggressive. 

Myself and many others here have spent hours putting thought and reading so so much. I liken this forum and endless sphere to a library......when I have had reports to write or want to learn something specific and go to the library I don't go to the librarian and say "hey tell me about how to rethreaded a bolt and what tools I'll need and where I can buy bolts and the sizes." I might ask them to point me in the direction of woodworking and tools, then dig stuff up myself.

Just how I look at it.

 Sorry though, didn't mean for you to come away thinking they were dumb questions, more emphasizing self learning.😉

Hey @ajaynagra, awesome to see you are doing another group buy! Great service last time, so I'm in for another one ;) Hope it's still possible to join in?

I'd be down for:

* 1 x Sensored 190kv 6374 motor
* 1 x Motor mount for Caliber Trucks - Left Side
* 1 x Kegel pulley kit - 16T/36T - 12mm
* 1 x Antispark Switch
* 1 x Charger - 42v4a
* 1 x BMS

I read trough the entire topic, but I do have some additional questions:

* How about import duty, taxes... No chance of surprise additional costs?
* For the side of the motor mount: I assume 'left side' is when the mount is rear mounted and the board with wheels down, that the mount is on the left when looking in the forward direction of travel? Because I'd like my mount on my rear heel side (my stance is regular). 
* Is there a spec sheet of the BMS available?
* Is there a possibility of purchasing additional wires, connectors and maybe a battery percentage screen (and how about the price)?

Thanks in advance!

Emiel

So just to help clear up on how to order the appropriate "side"  for your set up. 

The motor mount file names are as follows.  Please use the file name when ordering. 

**Motor Mount 2. = Goofy Heel side, Regular Toe Side.**
**Motor Mount 2_Mir. = Goofy Toe Side, Regular Heel Side.**

I assume heelside would be better since leaning deep to the heelside is slightly more difficult, which makes the board rotate a bit less to the trucks on that side and thus less chance of the motor touching the deck while turning. Anyone else with theories on this aspect?
```

I was always under the impression that having the motor under your heel is better as more weight is directly over it for traction? If its set up right with risers, you shouldn't really be able to touch the motor mount whilst leaning any amount. These mounts are **very** hard to bottom out with 1/4" riser (you'd need to be doing some crazy leaning) and impossible to bottom out on a 1/2" riser, @JuniorPotato93 has informed me!

I think 39 euros is a pretty good price, people sell the TB and Winning for 60, enertion's nano x is 44 but will likely go up, so even at single price it's kind of a good deal. Remember it's reliable (never heard of any issue), cool looking (no bulky 2nd channel stuff), rechargeable (TB's trigger style one isn't) and should also have a "half throttle" mode, to begin with less kicking power. In my opinion it's one of the best out there, I think @Jinra use this, correct me if I'm wrong though

Thanks guys, i have sent payments to pretty much everything but there has been a few issues which needs to be resolved .

1) People that sent their money to me via goods and services and not paid for the fees meant that I have lost 150e - i will need to sort this out somehow

2) Shipping time is 12-15 days which still costs $570 just for shipping (for the batteries) which is way more than anticipated - i need to discuss with everyone what i should do here. Fedex costs $791 but thats costing even more money.

3) The high shipping costs probably will mean i will lose out on some money here which i dont want to happen so i am going to find a solution for this - since this is a huge group buy i hope you understand that this wasnt going to go perfectly.

Thanks guys i hope to hear some  guidance on what i should do.

Theres 40~ people in the groupbuy - for the costs of the products i didnt really account for the high costs for shipping since 1kg is 7.7$. This is a learning process but if do split like 400$ for shipping by 40ish people thats only like 10$ but we will do a fair deal

You can't lose out on this after your hard work. 
You'd been pretty clear on the way to pay so that should be recoverable...
Can the extra on the shipping be split by value or weight?

## \#443 Posted by: ajaynagra Posted at: 2016-12-31T17:55:49.710Z Reads: 108

This is how the shipping works.

Its 7.7$ for 1KG - this is included with the customs i need to pay.

Trucks - 500g
Wheels - 300g

But stuff like controllers are minimal.

The real shocker is the batteries since they are dangerous goods and need to be shipped via UPS express

I am getting 16 packs for the GB but it wouldn't really be fair splitting the 570$ by 14/15 ways would it since that would be an additional 38$ which actually doesn't seem too bad after-all since the price of the packs are so much cheaper than any other competitor such as the space cell.

Value or Weight it really doesnt matter too much but i dont want people to be unhappy here.

Ajay, can you explain the issue with paypal? How can I check if I did something wrong there?

It seems like the added cost can be easily translated to people by their order. e.g., 
Tracks: 5$
Wheels: 3$
Packs: 38$
I hope people will be ok with the added cost (I know I will).

I think that this is a group buy and we need to solve this as a group, for the best of it and Ajay, we cannot ask Ajay to weigh or measure the volume of each package and make the calculation for each one. This will make a huge delay to get out the goods, in my opinion I think it's a better solution to pop up 10 bucks each and go on. Please consider it just like an opinion, I will be up for the best of the group.
 Cheers guys and happy new year!!!

I would have to disagree to an extent. If someone has only ordered a set of wheels for 29e and is then asked for an additional 10e to cover postage for someone elses batteries then I think they would be rightly annoyed. 

There are 2 problems to solve. 

Paypal issues.

I think anyone that has not paid by friends and family needs to either increase the amount that they have sent with @ajaynagra to advise each person individually. Alternatively could they be refunded the full amount and resend it via F&F? 

Postage issues.
I think yinnons suggestion is pretty solid. If the major cost is being caused by batteries then some kind of share across the board but not wholly by the battery buyers seems fair. If we could know the split of wheel, truck and battery orders then we could work out a spread that people are happy with?

I'd agree with everyone paying 10% or 10$ whatever works out for you . This would be my first group buy I'm participating in and I did not know/read it at all. 

With all respect, I'm glad someone is doing this for the community. However I do not think this is done with the highest degree of professionalism.. I've seen some other group buys which tackle this with offering full transparency. I think everyone here agrees if you make some profit to cover for your work and troubles. So no need to keep everything so tight.

I feel like there was too much information left and it all came together after several hundred posts. Specific information about the parts,... .All information should be available in the top post. Like how this all will go down. What steps you are taking and so on... 
More important though. The deadlines should be clear to keep the estimated shipping times. Since the parts aren't going to arrive by anyone before late January(est. shipping was late December) 

Anyway :smile: just a little constructive critisicm of mine. No hard feelings though. Maybe some things you can integrate next time.

What it does sense to me is that we buy as a group for the benefit of that. No one did know about the shipping cost it will increase in such amount. Then if I should pay 38 extra bucks I will say I don't want that, I want my money back I'm not interested.
 If is more people in the situation the group falls down, and no one will have the advantage of group buy. No one will have the goods before Chinese new year. Not to mention the headache will have Ajay for help us out with the group and now we are asking to splitting everything. Nice "group" btw.
Agree with that, the group, could be better organised.
 But sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
The percentage option doesn't have any sense, just inmo.
This was just an example about group buy, if I need to pay this 38 bucks I will do it.

I took the liberty to prepare a spreadsheet with the three options for paying for the shipping that where proposed:

1. By shipping costs - 3$ for wheels, 5$ for tracks, 38$ for battery
2. By price (10% of the total)
3. Fixed (10$ each)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfxusbf0nHbSehzli6hrRfE5HnuyVNiASdbqaaGPDzg/edit?usp=sharing

I already exceeded my budget of about 200 euros, 10€ more wouldn't be a problem, 40€ may be, since I'm just 16 y/o and don't have a regular income. If somebody have bought two batteries, 80 euros more could kill his budget and he may have to delete his order, while 10 euros each wouldn't kill any body's and even the small orders, adding 10 euros, are still the best prices out there.

Yes but it would not be fair to people who ordered few small stuffs and helped whole group to get lower prices... It turns out that small orders (wheels , pulleys etc) are paying for expensive battery shipping that somebody else ordered.. 
My suggestion is. If batteries are problem then peoples with battery orders should pay the bigger part of that added shipping cost , everyone else with smaller-lighter parts should pay less.. Maybe something like 15$ per battery pack and  lets say 3% of total parts worth for  everything else? Peoples with only smaller and lighter parts should only pay 3% of total amount... Ofcourse if that is not enough you can always adjust the percentages and battery shipping cost so the total summ covers your extra expenses

I don't see why the percentage is fair. The VESC is lightweight and not dangerous but cost quite a lot. So the price/weight ratio is the best. But would need to pay quite a lot to cover extra cost where it did not contribute much to the raised shipping fee.

Wheels seem to add to weight.
And battery was the most what raised the shipping fee.

So it would be fair to split it amongst the items that contributed to the raised weight / "danger fee" and not amongst people

My order was pretty small around 50 quid so some of the shipping charges now proposed would increase my cost by nearly 20%. To me percentage or weight would seem fairest. 
Perhaps if I'd bought 700 quids worth of stuff I'd be happier with everyone paying the same as it'd be a win win situation. 
I guess that's why you'll have 2 opposing views. 
I'll pay up either way and if anyone doesn't feel happy with the end result they could perhaps offer the other buyers on the group buy to buy their stuff?

Looking at those additional postage charges maybe just adding them up at this stage maybe the easiest thing to do, Could you create an extra column at the end of each persons order line that would show how much each person would need to pay this way?

Can somebody explain the paypal issue? I have paid 246€ (210 GBP) and 203 GBP have been sent, so there was about a 3% loss, I didn't pay more because paypal told me that the seller pays the fee. The rate I found on the paypal website was 1.9%+0.35€, which is significantly different from the one I had to pay. Another number I found is 5%.

So how do I make sure ajay gets all his money? Can't I just tick a box somewhere to let me pay the fee instead of ajay?


If I have to pay manually I would have to pay not only my extra shipping payment of 10.40€ but also the missing fee on the first payment of around 7 GBP AND again the added percentage (3.01% more?) of the total of the first two costs named.

These fee compensations are getting ridiculously messy, how did you guys do this?
Sorry for my paypal ignorance I just feel like I'm missing something.

I'm fine with the extra payment for shipping. Had a perfect group buy with Ajay before, unexpected things like this can happen. With the shared cost it's definitely still a great offer for everyone I think. @ajaynagra, let us know when the final rates are set so we can pay you and get this going :wink:

Ok in case people have the same issue as me, what we did was refunding my first payment.
Now ajay is finishing figuring the shipping issue out and after he's looking to send a paypal payment request  of the total cost (All items+Old shipping+New shipping) to me, which should result in me automatically paying the fee and ajay not losing out due to it.

Looks like there is now a column on the far right that tells you how much you now need to pay to cover the postage. Don't forget to send this as a friends and family paypal payment or add on the additional costs. @ajaynagra that sounds like a good way of doing it that you have worked out with @ACIN.

Hopefully we can get this sorted asap - really keen to crack on with the build!

Goddamn, it took so much, but I'm glad to hear that!  I paid only for the shipping of battery and trucks, since you didn't reply anymore. Do you want me to pay for the extra shipping of the new group buy or not, since I can have my old stuff? 
(for those who don't know, I basically ordered 170 euros of stuff from the last group buy, ajay sent it and the shipping company lost it for two months lying about where it was to me and to him. He handled the situation very well and offered to refund me/get the same stuff again on the next group buy and send it with the new stuff I ordered. I accepted the second option, now after he ordered the same stuff again, they delivered the old package back.)  We basically have some double parts, if anybody wants a set of 90mm black 75A flywheels, a pulley-belt kit and a 6374 motor

Hi @ajaynagra . 
I would use 5065 Motors. Would the offered motor mounts fit with [this motor](http://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-5065-BRH5065-200KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-With-Gear-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-1117658.html)? 

I would have ordered following:

1x 83mm Flywheels Set
1x Pair of caliber clone Trucks
1x Maytech VESC

And if the  motor Mounts fit the 5065 Motors I would also order one for the left and one for the right side..


I have two questions... 
1.The BMS is for how much 18650 Cells in series? And how much V does this BMS require for charging the batteries?!
2.The Vesc is rated at 50A? Isn't it a little too low..

Yes, i actually have the final costs for battery shipping.

So those added fees i charged everyone hopefully are covered although i havent actually added up those payments yet, if some things dont add up ill sort it out later but main objective is to get those batteries to me.

@ajaynagra: a simple WP+woocommerce site should be enough. Just add all products an set stock limits on them. It's possible to integrate paypal or stripe with it so the payments will be sorted. Though I think you can only use paypal in merchant mode. 

Woocommerce can calculate shipping for you as well if you take some time and add the rates. It will also create electronic orders and pick lists. 

I can help you putting this together if you want.

Cheers

Should we expect the shipping from you to be sent in 5 days, unless it is a battery, in which case we should expected it to be shipped in 10-14 days?

Does that mean that the CNC (mounts) are also ready and will make it on time?

You could use an heat gun, as already mentioned, but you should pay attention to do not overheat the motor.. if you can find a key, imo would be a better job, since both motor and gearwheel has the room for it..you put some screw lock glue on the key and locking screw, so if you need to change something it would be lot easier and safer. My brother works in a mechanic workshop, I'll ask him to make a couple of keys for me

@ajaynagra, Maybe you should just list all the added costs (shipping, customs, etc.) minus the extras we already paid so we can see what the total loss is. I'm sure we can work something out with everyone so you don't have to carry these costs alone.

If you're new here, it should be okay. It would, for me. Be sure to have a battery with a sufficient discharge rate

I hoped the parts could be at my door until the 8th of february. :slight_smile: 

Don't want to push you, I just have a tight time frame in which I can build my board because after that I will be out of the country for a month. 
But if it doesn't work until then it's no problem for me. I would build it when I am back.

Refund from the CNC machine people? I have started to talk to them, they made 1 small error on the flywheel pulleys (but thats not the problem) but they were prepared to do all of the machining for the pulleys again.

But i think it was a design problem and their problem. But I will ask just in case :smiley:

Hi @ajaynagra - I think I have found someone locally to me who might be able to sort my pulley. I don't know him personally though so can't really ask him to do more than mine and would be afraid of the responsibility for everyone's! Please could you dispatch my order. I've paid postage and the bit extra. Also please could you give details of the spare battery charges you have?  I'm guessing 36v with an end point of 42v? What amp are they?

Hi, if everything in my order is ready apart from the pulley then can you please just send the order without the pulley to me first? You can send me the pulley once it's been fixed, I don't mind paying for shipping twice. Thanks

Ajay can you give us an status update on what you are up to at the moment ? What needs sorting out, get shipped or what you still need to do. The US Group buy is kept up to date and shipments are already getting sent. 
@JLabs also had a statement on this whole group buy which I think was a nice effort.

I'll have exams coming up and will need to rent the lathe at my University. Its unexpected but I guess its contributing to the forum... I just need to know beforehand so I know when I can expect it so it doesn't get into my exam studying phase..

@ajaynagra if ups doesnt check the packages under x-ray, there is no way they will block your in-EU shipments. BUT if they proceed with the scan you will likely have to pay the return trip to your house (which in my case was almost twice the cost of the actual shipping)

Anyways I believe ups uses street/train trasnportation inside Europe, at least in the mainland.

Yeah I was referring to [this](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-on-the-block-maytech-vescs/3705) thread, apparently @psychotiller is running his Maytech VESC's on FOC and they work fine, although he only uses an 8S Battery and I am using a 12S.
The Maytech VESC has some slight mechanical imperfections compared to the VESC 4.12, and if you want to run FOC on the older model you should be very careful with your settings and concious about your setup.

I will probably test FOC out carefully if I really am not happy with the noise of my carvon v2.5's and post my results :smile:

I thought after the delay of almost 2 months, which could've been prevented, as @JLabs stated, if you had held an steady communication with him and those involved. I thought you'd at least try to end this group buy smoothly by sending those shipments out to everyone fast. On the US side, JLabs managed to get it done immediately while taking care of the problems asap. Lathe the pulleys, wrong bolts.. And he even apologized to the people. 

People have paid for their stuff and YOUR services. And I know those wholesale prices, there is quite some profit involved.
But the only thing we get is constant "one-sentence-replies". I bet people would be satisfied if you'd just take 5 mins and get some pictures up or do a through Status Update on everyones items.
I've worked part-time in a logistics centre and was packing up thousands shipments the whole day. And trust me this wouldn't even take an hour.

Its just frustrating because me for example could've finished my build 2 months ago and I would've gladly paid a few more bucks to do so...

Chill hombre and learn from your mistakes. Dude is a student and did this to help everyone out. Stop throwing tissy fits and go thru professional vendors if you want the perfect clean deal. This is a diy forum for peeps who are still learning, that learning is not just how to build but how to source and find deals.

Well done @ajaynagra Just been out in the dark and been for a spin with some of the parts in place. (I'm still missing the charger though)
Not connected up the battery but using the motor mount, huuuuge motor and kegel pulley.
All really nice stuff, solid mount and magnificent pulley.
Used 3x 3s lipos and an enertion vesc.
Very happy. Although I believe I'm the only person to receive anything? It'd be really cool to hear from others receiving stuff or perhaps just a word or two from Ajay to reassure.....?

Anyone who has their pulleys lathed by me should pm me once the package arrives. So I can check shipping/boxing costs.

Damn guys, I hope he didn't ship it with hermes. That's a semi-scam company, last time he used it with me and they sent it back after keeping it for two months. He didn't know it, and people from the last group buy received it really fast, but I checked the company and here in Italy it's rated 1 star out of five, many people didn't get their packages. I told him not to ship with them anymore, don't know if he listened to me. By the way, he also offered me a refund when my stuff didn't arrive, so I would exclude the scam option from him. Still, this lack of communication does not help and I'm starting to get a little frustrated, since when did not even send my stuff out yet

Hi guys

Just want to add here the current situation. I don't know any of the parties personally but realised that there is an issue with the GB and DM'd Ajay to find out what is going on. 

I have made clear that the priority now has to be to get the parts to the people that have paid for them. 

I understand everyone's frustration as I too have been frustrated by the delays. Trying to work through the issues with Ajay. Don't feel I have a full picture of the situation yet. I think it's safe to say this grew far beyond what Ajay expected and was a huge amount to handle. 

Will update as I can.

To be honest guys I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it all. I think there seems to be some left over issues from previous group buys. Probably not stuff for open forums but equally not stuff that should be impacting this GB.

I just want to see how we get this fixed and see us all out on boards.

I'm appreciative of all the time, effort and cost complications that goes into a group buy as large as this. I give @ajaynagra a huge thanks for even attempting to try and manage it by himself. I believe we've all been understanding of this since December. However, I feel like I must be missing something as I, like others, know my parts are with Ajay and I've actually been told that my parts are small and ready to be sent. I just don't understand why the very final stage has taken so long. I've read every post and been following this since the very beginning and understand there are complications outside this GB but feel they shouldn't be causing all 40 odd people to be left waiting weeks/months for parts they know are ready to be sent. I was told mine would be sent the day after we'd been messaging and now, two weeks later, I've heard and received nothing.

I'd like reiterate my appreciation for all the time and effort already invested by Ajay, it just strikes me that this final stage should be moving a little faster as I've waited with great anticipation since the 22nd of November. So what is the definitive reason our packages aren't being sent when we've paid?

If you look at post #825 Ajay wrote that all but last 10 people's orders on the spreadsheet are packed and shipped. There are 48 names on the spreadsheet so 38 order should have been packed and shipped. This was 9 days ago and 2 people have received their orders. How many have received a tracking code? I hope we will get more information quickly and people start receiving their orders.

So what exactly is the reason he doesn't send those packages ?? 
How does something that happened from the last GB affect the sending of the packages.. 
And why does he need someone to justify his own situation in this group.. 

@ajaynagra if you got scammed by someone last group buy then you might as well handle it within this community and get help here. However I don't understand why you are starting another one if you couldn't resolve all issues with the last one. Look at how the situation is derailing... All those people just want to know one thing. What is happening with the items they have paid for.

At this point I think that is the most resonable thing to do. I was really looking forward to the equipment, and was willing to adjust my expectations, both from the timeline perspective and from the price perspective. Hoewever, the lack of communication makes it really hard for me to keep my hopes up.

@ajaynagra, unless I get a clear proof that my package is on its way in the next week, I'll be filing a formal paypal [dispute](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/brc/disputes-claims-chargebacks-and-bank-reversals#dispute).

Alright guys i have been unfaithful to you guys and i shouldnt of lied about saying that i sent the packages, but it seemed like a short term way of getting myself time on thinking what was best for me.

I never wanted this group buy to end this way but I never expected it to get so big. Now I have the difficulty of paying money for packaging but I hate even more if people had to wait longer for these packages to arrive.

I feel like i have shamed all of you by lying and not answering all these questions, i should of been truthful about everything and i hope if there is another group buy it will be when im in a better situation.

If ask for you not to open a paypal dispute since im a young guy thats losing money by just running this group buy and i hope i send your package very soon.

I know all you guys are angry but its harder to answer all these questions without lying and i feel so guilty about this

With all respect at 17 so are you. This has been a lot to handle and we can learn and move on. Before anyone sends any money. @ajaynagra please can you write a post with the link to the spreadsheet and make in bold a line next to each persons order to tell them how much they need to send. 

I think there also needs to be a solution for those people that can't pay the remaining postage. As a suggestion perhaps if there is anyone in that situation then they could offer the parts for sale but at the new price to include postage for Ajay. Then Ajay would post to the new buyer and the original buyer would get paid and just send Ajay the postage price. I doubt there will be anyone in this situation but it would be good to be able to offer this.

Glad that you made this decision Ajay :) would've been even better if you decided to be honest earlier. I don't think anyone here would mean to harm you.. just frustrated ppl who have builds planned and want To stay within their timeframe.

I have no issues if I have to pay additional cost. But can you explain where all the money went and what you still need to pay specifically ? Is it just the packaging or does shipping still need to be paid.

 Does this mean tax+shipping from china took all the money ? What about the profit you made from this GB ? That should be a considerable amount there..

If you need I can send what you want, but I'll do it when I see a photo of my package with my address ready to be shipped. i've been waiting for far too long, If you were another person I would have already asked for my money back at this point, but I decided to trust you. Now avoid every problem and tell exactly what happens, If you have delays just say that. And ship with good companies, don't get in any more problems by using shit services like hermes.
Now do a spreadsheet with where whose money went. Those motors cost 40 euros from factory, we paid 75 + shipping and taxes. We all agree to give you some profit for your time, just tell us exactly where all the money went. And by the way, If there's a scammer around here, it would help the whole community to know that.

This would be nice because there are some interested in leftover parts like myself.

Great to see that you @ajaynagra are honest finally. Only if you are honest with all the buyers, who participated in this groupbuy, you will find the best solution for all of you!

If you have some spare parts, I would be glad to buy some from you.

It would be nice and quite necessary!!!-, if you before sending out packages, contact with PM those who you ready to ship to. So you showing in picture of whole content of package, get confirmation from buyer that everything is in place and then ship it out in next day! 

Because people should be sure that you sending right stuff out. So that nothing missing, like @bigben had batteries and voltmeter, but battery charger wasn't... Or
@bardialongo had one flywheel gear(and corresponding plate) is missing :frowning: while the motor gears are both present..

 Please, contact people before shipping with photos added !! :grin: 

And send me PM with photos, at least 3 photos from different sides of my 8S4P battery pack! I had asked that 5 days ago, but you forget to do it. I need to see my battery pack for planning my build! Need to see it if it really does exist, so i can sleep tight! :sleeping:

Best Wishes..

After this story I don't think it's too much to ask for a photo. How should we trust him, when he was lying. We already gave him more money and now we should give again more money.

with all due respect, that'll just slow things down's for everyone, and as such could be seen as quite selfish. All that means is paypal get in contact with Ajay on your behalf giving him further worries and distractions, that so far have been the reason cited for the delays. Also, If you sent it via friends and family as was intended then I don't think they'll even do anything for you.
If you've read his few previous messages you'll understand that getting angry and making threats is just gonna prevent him from being open and honest with us as we really need him to be to get through in as satisfactory a manner as is possible.
An please realise, for every one person getting vocal in this thread there are about 5-10 others, watching & waiting patiently and wondering if these others are actually getting in the way of your stuff being sent. Just my thoughts on the matter

At this point asking for a refund is useless. It's a matter of waiting 7 or waiting 10 days, it doesn't change much. He has the packages, he sent pics (to me at least, with my name written on it), he promised he would ship them today and keep us updated. If you ask your money back (I don't even think it's possible), he will just have less money to ship and more useless stuff.

Ajay has already ended successfully 2 group buys. If he was a lazy ass he would have stopped way before this point. The only thing that has changed is that scam (that I can't tell you about, but it does affect a lot the organization of this group buy). Shipping packages is "easy ass hell" if you have the money. He didn't, he tried the "easiest" way of not facing the truth. I have been in contact with him for the last six months and, while he's not always in time, at the end he does his best. I'm as angry as you, if not more, about this situation. All my stuff should have been here in NOVEMBER, and March is approaching now. But I understood that this stuff takes a lot of time and effort. When my package was lost, he dealt with it and offered me a complete refund, even if he didn't have his stuff back yet. It was a 200€ loss for him, at the moment. 
I gave him an ultimatum as well, for today. Getting angry isn't gonna change anything, but it's time for him to show he has balls, I agree with this

I think we're having allot of patience putting up with nothing but vague or even no answers at all. It's not his first GB so he knew what needed to be done. It's been 2 months now and we've all been patiently waiting. I think after this much waiting and patience we can demand our products.

If he doesn't let us know what the problem is and keeps being vague we can not help this GB further. Just take a few minutes of your day and explain to us why we are still waiting, it won't hurt. But if you keep being invisible and vague people will start demanding their money back and the problem will be too big to overcome by yourself.

I think we deserve an explanation and a quick solution. You've done two GB before, it's not like it's all new to you.

I'm sorry to say this, but @ajaynagra you're kinda being a !#$% right now.

I have a strong sense at this point that @ajaynagra is in a big trouble here and can't deliver the goods (at least not all of the goods). Otherwise I don't see we why he doesn't follow up on his promise to ship after "coming clean". 

I'm going to wait with the dispute until the end of the week as I promised above (but my hunch is that the situation won't change by than).

For those who can't dispute, I suggest escalating this issue to an actual lawsuit. The fact that this is a group buy, the fact that it is ran by a young person, the fact that this is the internet, those should not change the fundamental rules of decency.

C'mon @ajaynagra.
Time for a little update, the troops are getting restless.
If you can simply lay out your problems then we'll be one step closer to sorting things out.
A problem shared is a problem halved, perhaps...
Is there anything that people can do that might help? Has it all gone so wrong that a few £3.50's won't really dent the problem? Whatever you say it will be better than keeping quiet. People have busy lives, but, you not finding 5 minutes to give some idea of where this is seems to be wearing a bit thin.

I hoped my package would have arrived in the end of december so I could have built my board in christmas holidays. Now I really hope this can be sorted out in the next two weeks so I will have the stuff when I get back from my trip, because if it takes even longer then university starts again and 
I won't have time to build.

He is not someone anymore. He has online shop, he  has done two (from what I read successful) GB. It is still not for threatening but for doing what we can to find out whats going on.

If someone can clarify what making a claim on paypal will do? Only make things worse for anyone who has and hasnt received their parts. Even then, if you gifted money its gonna be a jar of pickles to get your money ('if its even possible')

Just telling you guys to be safe.

At this point im seriously doubting if I or anyone in this thread will ever see their ordered components. We just had allmost another 4 days since @ajaynagra responding to anything. Friday im filing a dispute with paypal. I'm sorry for the rest of the people in this buy, but i cant afford to give someone 250 euros.

I guess I should start looking elsewhere for my parts.. I've lost all trust in him(twice)... I'm sorry guys but if he doesn't reply in the next 24 hours I'll make use of Paypal and claim my money back. 
I assume its the quantity this time. Didn't know he was 17. Mby he didn't know about import duty, taxes and laws ? 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/europe-gb-wheels-trucks-motor-mounts-battery-pack-vesc-switch-controller/13419/659?u=tranxfu

If VAT is 20%, that means he paid around **250£** for the pulleys + mounts. 
We had 26 Mounts * 22€ = 572€ + 30 Pulley kits * 35€ = 1050€ which is in total **1622€**

And that is just the pulleys+mounts... A wheel set is around 8€ and so are the trucks. We paid 30€. You can imagine how much that amounts to. 
So I really don't get where all that money went to. Its just right for us to demand a sheet with all the costs. 

Maybe he didn't claim it correctly and got into problems with the law because of profiting/tax,...
Don't get me wrong. I don't care about the prices. But we should stop throwing money at him until he reveals a sheet that shows us where the money went. I can't imagine him missing money to pay for "packaging" lol.

Someone who lives in UK should do this. I live in Finland so i have to report this to Finnish police, which probably can't do much, but if everyone makes an report to own local police this might work.

I am relaxed and pretty laid back, however, this has nothing to do with a person being chill or not my E-skate brother. Rather, this is about  peeps looking to save a buck or two. This is a forum. There are multiple licenced vendors on this forum, that pay taxes and work with eskates as a full or part time job. We as a group put our faith/money in the hands of a virtual unknown ( yes maybe he hosted others group buys but thats small potatoes compaired to the likes of @onloop @torqueboards @psychotiller @trampa)  with no credible business, license, storefront, or webfront.......honestly people when you cut corners to save a buck you should expect to get smacked back on your ass at least 1/4 times.

 I repeat this for emphasis: You Gave Money to a Dude on a Forum. 

The worst part about this is he seems upstanding, all be it young, naive, and understandably worried about money ( any of you remember being broke as crap in Uni, living off ramen and beer?).
And we probably will all be getting our cheap parts,soon which is more than many can say for group buys off forums. Unwad your panties people. Better late than never. 
This chill mo fo is out.

I repeat again, brother. Have you actually read what happened the last few weeks ? 
This has nothing to do with buying at a licensed vendor / saving a buck or whatnot...
This guy is profiting enough from this Group buy and should not be worried about money. If he got scammed by anyone from the last GB. It should not affect this one. He shouldn't even started this if he didn't sort his problems out.

The "babies and douchebags" here are upset because he keeps giving vague answers, goes missing for days, constantly lying about stuff. I know that my stuff is lying around in his garage for almost 4 weeks now, and the only thing he has to do is drop it off at a courier. Since he already paid for the shipment label. And then lies to about that he did it 3 weeks ago. Again is lying about talking to the office. And then finally admits that he has not shipped ANYTHING out yet. AND then assures me that it goes out next week on monday. AND then goes missing again... 
And if the situation is about to unrail and he suddenly comes back with an vague reply. 

Sry but I'm generally f*****ng pissed off if ANYBODY is trying to do shit like with me. I'm a university student too and am butt deep into exams. Guess what. I still have time to check this thread several times a day and write stupid shit like this... I even accepted to take his responsibility to lathe the pulleys for everyone and was expecting them to be delivered before exams so I can take care of shit like that too.


EDIT: Anyway. I'm done with this and just want the parts. thanks. No hard feelings @monkey32 :kissing_heart:
I don't even want to lash out on him anymore. @ajaynagra just please get this over and done with.

Updating on where I'm standing here:
@ajaynagra, I'm going to file a PayPal dispute on tomorrow (Friday) at 6PM GMT (as I said before). The only thing that will convince me not to file a dispute would be a proof that my package is on the way (tracking code + picture of the package content), in which case I will wait for the package to arrive (and verify the goods are as promised).

I'm sorry, but I see no other option. I apologize to other members of the group buy who might suffer from this dispute indirectly.

If people haven't received all parcels by that date then those that have paid as business can claim back (deadline for this is 180 days) and for those that have paid by F&F then I suggest this would be a substantial enough issue for the police fraud team.

Its not more than 1KG i have weighed them in the past

Im planning to do a lot of work on this groupbuy on weekend but school is equally important i have 12 hours of exams in the next couple of weeks and i have to juggle both school and this, pictures arent a problem. I will do that now but opening paypal disputes are just not helping at all.

I realise and understand when people are mad but I wake up at 5oclock in the morning then usually check the group buy go to school at 8 and come back home at 6/7. 

If you want pics @yinnon ill PM them and send when i can but i have no desire of taking anyones money if i did i would take the 10k at the start, you realise how much trust people put in me why would i scam at this stage. I dont even own an esk8 or use a longboard none of these parts are useful to me.

I ask everyone to take their paypal claims back since i cant even use the money in the paypal without that

@Reamondrum2 Ill Pm your package

@TranxFu 5KG inc pulleys

Right OK great to see progress. Yes I think some pics would work wonders. Anything you can send like that and tracking numbers would be good. As for those that have raised a PayPal dispute. Please can we have a line in the sand of the 21st? That way @ajaynagra has some time to work and everyone knows what deadline is.

@ajaynagra  Enough with this bulls#*t for god sake, really!!!!!

 Why is so hard send packages out? Make 10 packages a day and 4 days after all done, super easy, one hour a day, that is it! 

When i was doing my final works for high school, like really important and super heavy projects, i had two month old baby on my hands, part job and I was sleeping maybe 3-5 hour a day, sometimes 3 days in row with no sleep at all. And guess what i manage everything what i should do, my finals- i done them with highest mark. So don't cry that your school is taking all your time, in day is 24h, sometimes sacrifice a bit time from your sleeping time and you'll be done! You are not one player in this game, here's a bunch of people and they feeling pissed off. I'm normally very polite, but you making me swear. 

So get your ass and do what you should be done a while ago, here's 40 people waiting stuff and been very kind with you.

If I was Ajay, a 17 year young student who got himself into more than he could handle with lots of people bombarding me constantly I would probably avoid it too. Also I find it highly unlikely I would be trying to rip off people on a site like this.

He is most likely just fucking stressed out and anxious to come back here without having any good news, doing as much as an unorganized teen in his exam period can do.

The mods can't do much here, sorry guys. I would recommend that none of you file disputes, remember what happened with Jacob's hubs? You'd be getting your money back, but ajay would be left with thousands of dollars worth of parts, and what's he gonna do with those? Resell them? Very high chance that once this group buy is done he will stop doing them altogether. If someone in the U.K. is willing to take over this job, that could also be an option. The fact he hasn't even sent a picture yet seems a little fishy, it takes 2 minutes max to take a picture and post it. 

And @ajaynagra , POST A PICTURE. I know there is a lot of pressure on you, find an hour or two and get all those packages sent out. It's a trip to the post office, I'm sure you can find time.

I also recommend that in the future you do not take up these types of things, once you have finished uni it might be ok for you, but for now, leave it to someone who has more time.

It's a big money involved in this group buy, too big that ajay will remain unpunished even if he is only 17.

It's not like 17 year old guy can steal, for an example, 10 thousand eur and will remain virginal, it's a cybercrime.
[quote="ajaynagra, post:1131, topic:13419"]
f you want pics @yinnon ill PM them and send when i can but i have no desire of taking anyones money if i did i would take the 10k at the start, you realise how much trust people put in me why would i scam at this stage. I dont even own an esk8 or use a longboard none of these parts are useful to me.

 It is not 5 eur stealing from your grandma, it is about 10 thousand steeling from 40 people. I think we as a group  can claim for a justice!! We all have proof that this group buy exists, we have proof chats through emails, we have proof that we send him money and so on.

Is somebody in this forum know laws and human rights or similar? Maybe we can hear your opinion?!

Do think it's a shame he's not giving us some small update, that won't take too much time. And I'm still pretty interested in the part where someone ripped him off.

Actually Action Fraud don't investigate any cases. They are just a reporting tool. It would likely have to go to a fraud team within the police on the basis of fraud or theft charges. BUT I think that is the final resort. We have given plenty of time for this to be resolved before the 21st.

I think everyone who can open Paypal dispute, should do it now. Then we should make a list of people without this possibility and do a brain storm, where can we go as a group with this?

If we have to do that, all of us should report this as fraud to police and contact paypal despite that most of us paid via friends and family. 

But I think we should contact paypal before police.

I guess we said the 21st but the fact that he hasn't been on in 7 days is really worrying. I'm not sure why he has replied to my email but not posted here. 

I'll email again. I have done a bit of investigation and I think I know where he studies. If we don't hear back soon then I think then next step is to go through them and see if we can speak to his parents.  If that doesn't go anywhere then we have no other choice but go to the police. I'm not sure if that will help us get our parts though. 

I'm a dad of 2 (one 6 months) so have limited "hobby money" that isn't spent on the kids. If I dont get my parts I won't be building an esk8 full stop.

This may sound crazy but how about asking ajay to send back the money? 
If now is not a good time for him to handle the group buy, he can keep the parts and sell them later through his website, it's not like they'd be lost? It's just that many of us can't afford to wait any longer - i'm moving to the states on the 4th of april.

That would be a more elegant way to settle this than calling his parents or even the police.

Any thoughts on that @ajaynagra?

I don't think he's going to do that. If he really bought all this stuff he probably can't and don't want to pay money back.

@SirDiff you got your stuff? Atleast some of them. Do you have that box, because there should read ajays address. It will help us a little.

Agreed, but maybe he'll find a way. If not people will start take their money back against his will anyway - or even call the police apparently.

Between legal trouble and taking a loan or asking the parent's help, the choice would be easy for me.

Or maybe it's all good and we'll get our stuff before the 21st! Still hoping for that of course.

I didn't get my stuff, he just sent me a photo. Last time he sent me something, from the last group buy, I'm sure his address was on it because they sent it back after some problems. But I didn't receive it, so I don't know much. Everybody from the last group buy should have his address. 
I just don't get it, he bought my stuff, he has it in a box in a garage with my name on it, and I'm sure it's mine because the battery pack follows my layout instructions. Scamming us isn't gonna work, because he bought the stuff and he will never sell it without us knowing it, so why would he not send, if he could?

Lets stop throwing around with solutions like police or CIA and cyber fraud... He has the parts in his garage. We Just need someone to talk with his parents and they'll sort it out for us. He is a teenager after all. 

Everyone who has the possibility to open a PayPal dispute, **do it**. It is not as harsh as you think it is. He just has to ship the stuff, add a tracking no. and once its arrived we can close the dispute. Thats all there is to a PayPal dispute.

Did you see it? He just showed us a small part of it. We don't know the real reason of his behavior, we just have thoughts about it. We can not trust him, because he is a liar and if there is no big reason then he is also an a#&h*?$. He came to the forum just to make money. He even doesn't own an electric skateboard but maybe many parts of it.

Drafted this last night - how does it read?

To Charan Nagra / father of Ajay Nagra,

I am afraid I write to you regarding a serious issue I and many others are having with your son. You may or may not be aware that he is an active member of the Electric Skateboard Builders forum. The forum is a place where people who are interested in building electric skateboards meet to share build tips and guidance on parts etc. He has been industrious by arranged a number of successful group buys - where by he takes orders for parts which he has sourced from manufacturers, orders are paid for via paypal and then Ajay places the order with the manufacturers. He then posts the parts to the individuals and makes a small profit on each order.

Last year he began a new group buy which quickly grew in size and reached approx 40 orders and has a value of about 12,000 euros. As far as we are aware he has placed the orders for the parts and they have arrived in the UK (perhaps you could confirm?). we believe this maybe considerable time ago. The current situation is that only 2 people have received their parts. After months of chasing and Ajay giving a variety of excuses Ajay has become unresponsive on the forum, via email and via mobile phone. We are increasingly concerned about the situation. While there may be some explanation for the delay, everyone has been very patient and accommodating with any issues. Unfortunately as there is now no response, as a group there are only a few options left open to us. We still hope that this situation can be resolved however with any further delays I anticipate a series of actions from those that have placed orders.

Those that paid Ajay as a business will file a PayPal dispute which once processed will result in refunds being paid and Ajay being left out of pocket, Those that paid via F&F will be left with little choice but to file a police complaint. While individual orders may only represent small amounts, together this represents a much larger figure and is obviously is a serious issue.

We do not want it to come to this but we need swift action now to resolve this situation. You can read the full details of the group buy on this forum here:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/europe-gb-wheels-trucks-motor-mounts-battery-pack-vesc-switch-controller/13419 

I would appreciate a prompt response and happy to discuss over the phone if this is easier. My contact details are:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I am happy to act as the messenger for the other people that are involved with this Group Buy.

Kind regards
Dan

One step at a time. He showed us everything is packed up.

Next step is the labels.

After that let people, maybe via DM, know if they can help paying for shipping.

Then ship it out.

But first finish your school, it's important.

And I hope you learned something along the way from this experience :\

Hey ajay, good to hear back. Before we make everyone pay yet again, is it because this person who ripped you off? If yes can we help somehow
Also I don't, and I hope others here neither, expect you to sacrifice your exams for the packages, what would be great though and from my experience possible is a daily 10-15 minute check on this thread and your PM's so we know what's going on.

I've already sent cash so how about this:

When mine arrives I'll post a pic, then you can see that paying the postage gets the parcel to you. I can see how if there is no money then postage would soon add up. Esp if you are overseas. Plus then how does @ajaynagra pick who's to send out first and who's gets delayed while he waits for money for the first few posted. It would be a long process. 

Thanks for the pick of the postage label. Does anyone know if the tracking goes active when it is dropped off? (I am assuming the tracking number is the one under the barcode?)

I have opened a dispute on paypal with @ajaynagra like i said before in this thread. The deadline for me to be able to do anything with that claim is the 21st. So if i don't have my order by then i will have to escalate it as an order not received.

I don't think anyone is saying this is ideal but I'm not sure that's a smart idea. Let's play this out. You don't pay. You file your dispute and in 30 days you get your money back. In the mean time Ajay gets on with the shipping and parts are sent out to those that help him out and repay shipping. He is left with your parts which he re sells to someone else. It's an inconvenience to Ajay but doesn't leave him short in the long run. You still need parts and I don't see people lining up to set up GB so you end up paying retail. That's going to leave you out of pocket vs just paying the extra postage. Its not ideal and I don't blame you setting up a dispute but now things seem to be moving I'd at least sit tight to see if packages start arriving. Then if they do then pay the extra postage and build a board. Ajay has made pretty clear he is in the hole on this and the extra postage is the only way to make it happen. I could be wrong and my package might not be on the way but I'm a half full kind of guy.

I'm not sure I follow your argument. I think that the reputation that @ajaynagra built for himself in this GB does not allow me to give him any trust at this point. 

He is asking for something that is out of the agreed price, which is essentially asking for "a favor". If that was a normal GB, I might do that favor, but given the history of Ajay, I'm refusing to do so.

Yes, like all of us this f&^ked up my plans to build, and even worst, I can't make alternative plans before the issue is resolved. But I don't think that is an argument in favor of paying that additional cost.

For me this seems not to be a great deal anymore. I only ordered two sets of black 90mm wheels. I paid 15 Euro for shipping and the extra fee in january. And now, how much do you want? It was not your first groupbuy so you should know about import taxes and shipping costs. I can give you a few Euros but not before I have the wheels in my hand.

For me too. With all that extra payments I could get a battery **a months ago** from POLAND, with charger and bms. That guy from POLAND- takes 25 eur for shipping+ bms is sexy thin not like here- bulky mama, for gods sake! I remember I had given measurements of free space in my enclosure to @ajaynagra  and asked:do that battery will fit in my enclosure?- he said that he will make sure that factory will make it that it fits!! So only that why I send money, trusted him. But then was a surprise- battery is bulky huge in heigh its 4cm!! omg!! my enclosure is 3.2 max. So in this case I was pushed to buy another normal size bms from batterysupports.com, so I had to pay another 40 eur + 8eur shipping for bms, so, YES it is not good deal anymore!!!!!!!! I'm o.k. to pay few euros like 4eur max, but only when I see pictures with all my stuff, label on box and receipt from shipping it out. Only then I maybe will pay if I have a good mood. Even then I'm not feelin that I need to pay anyway. This all is monkey business!! 

If I was a ajay, I borrow money and ship packs out no askin for anybody anymore. I'm costumer I'm not a ajays partner, if I would then I had ajays problems on my sholders as well. We all been kind and lovin group, we already given extra cash so it will be just humiliated to us to pay again. Aghh! I hate this crap, just send stuff out @ajaynagra.  For an example, when farmer is selling you lamb meat, he is not asking extra money because another lamb needed a vet so he spended a lot to save that lamb!! NO, theese are unexpected cases, witch which are paid by the seller. And most important we don't know where all money gone, why was that extra payment before, whay again not enogh? and so on...

This all will be a expierence for ajay, he can make another, but much better group buy, make profit and give back lended money! This is just normal how business goes, ask to any businessman, he will tell you, that there is a plenty times when you faucked up yourself, make a mistake... nobody will sort it out for you, if you fu**ed up calculations it's your own problem!!!! So again, we already given extra so asking again it is total shakedown!!

Mate.. you're not the only person on the order? Im sure anyone can borrow £8, certainly not £8 * 40 or however many people are in this GB though? Frankly you've been talking shit the the whole group buy and id suggest you stay away from them in future. If you want your parts ASAP with customer service, order from a shop.You should know what youre getting into when you enter a group buy, and should expect delays, problems, and unexpected cost. At the end of the day this is the community trying to help each other, Ajay was under no obligation to do this in the first place, and its fairly common knowledge there's barely any profit to be made in a GB. Leave the kid alone, and source parts yourself next time

Not everyone is so trustful like you after that time with no clear explanation from ajay. I would wait if would clearly know why and for what.
I experienced alot of shit on the internet i just take care of my money and im lucky i didnt paid  with friends and family 
Dont tell me what i got to do or telling me that i talk shit . 
And i really dont understand why you upset with what i write. And for truth your opinion to that really doesnt matter. May you shit your pants because u paid by family and friends and scared now that if i get my money back that ajay wouldnt have the money to ship yours either. But thats none of my buisness. And mine shouldnt be yours...

Package has arrived today. Tons of wheel pulleys in here. Unfortunately there is no motor pulley and no belts included for my order of pulleys... @ajaynagra 

As I said I don't know when these are going to be lathed. I am deep in exams and don't know when I'll be able to rent the lathe at my university.

PS: There are also no bolts at all in my package

@ajaynagra could you update on what you are planning to do with all the shipments which are incomplete/missing items ? Feels bitter paying 35€ for a wheel pulley set(wheel & motor pulley, 3belts) and get just a wheel pulley PLUS 40 others which I need to lathe and sort out shipment myself ?...

You will add even more costs if you don't carefully pack those shipments

Here are some pics. I got **25** pulleys and only **10** of those discs which are there to hold the bolts(which are not included/existent) in place. Idk how I should handle these... First come first serve ? You will have to talk it out with @ajaynagra. He threw in some envelopes. So thats quite okay. 

Anyways I'd be happy if you could send me the rest of my order... As these pulley kits are useless without a single belt or the motor pulley. Did you take in account that I have ordered a **complete pulley kit** as well ? Did you just throw in a couple of pulleys for me to lathe or are these specific to every order/user ?

PS: I don't think these retainer rings will hold on for long. @JuniorPotato93 your shared retainer rings on thingiverse should fit these right ? :)

Today I wrote an e-mail to the father of Ajay and he replied. I explained the situation and that ajay wants to get money for shipping a second time and that we already paid an extra money in january and not all the people like to pay again and so on. 

He replied twice.

at first:

"Will speak to Ajay today, but he told me he waiting for postage, but I will try to sort this out and sent all the items. Thanks for letting me know."

and later:

"Hi can just make sure with the group, people who have paid postage they will have proof then let me know. Thanks."

Now I'm not sure what the second one means. What should I answer, Please help!

I rang up some parcel companies and they said they cant send dangerous goods e.g. lion batteries >100wh theres a new law since Jan 2017 where they heavily regulate these packages.

When nkon sends batteries they sell them as single ones. Problem starts when you connect them together.
Shipping companies don't allow a single pack >100Wh - single cells they don't care. You could ship a Tesla worth of batteries as long as they are single units and not connected.

You need to call ups and so on and ask them..
If i get it right its only forbidden to send batteries over 100wh with air mail unless you do it as dangerous goods
But send them not by plane (shipping over seas ) should be possible 

Maybe they can tell you sth or help you (or they do it):
http://www.packsend.co.uk/it-electronics-shipping/lithium-batteries/

But normally you organise sth like that before you order 10 or more of those batteries...
I hope you get it done it would be nice to know what fee you have to pay for shipping as dangerous good

I have been talking to a representative from nkon.nl and I was asking them about how they send their packages.

They send everything within the EU by land. Packaging companies dont scan/check for lithium batteries for deliveries on land.

The guy from nkon.nl said that they use DPD for orders. "DPD does all transport with the EU by surface, except islands like the canaries, malta cyprus Iceland.."

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/d/1d88ee6cbc46eed46f12f46ab719e202055510dc.png" width="690" height="387">

From the information I have got from nkon and the lack of information I have gotten from UPS, Fedex, Packnsend I have come to the conclusion that we should use DPD  because;

1) They deliver all packages on the surface
2) They wont scan/check the packages
3) Economical and reliable

I was at the workshop to work on my board today. I had some spare change and the lathe was free. I managed to lathe some pulleys. Will probably do them all tomorrow or the day after.

Anyone who has a pulley with me should contact me and we'll check shipping costs. 

As there are only 10 discs and those are shit anyways. I'll consider printing some retainer rings for those who want it. Made out of PETG filament. Would only want you guys to cover the material costs.

Hi guys! 

My order recieved today to UK Liverpool address witch I gave to @ajaynagra. Big Yes!! All parts in place! 

So next step will be for me since my relatives not coming to my country with car soon, so I will be using transporting company to deliver it to me. My girlfriend was using them a year ago to transport different stuff from uk to my country. They  charge 25 GBP to ship stuff up to 25kg. 

So maybe you all who are waiting for batteries, better find some companies what are doing that in your country. So that they just pick your stuff from ajay and deliver it to you.Just google for it, it should be like option in your countries also.

Update: I used my free afternoon yesterday and got all pulleys done. Anyone who has one with me should write me a message containing address and what pulley was ordered. I'll countercheck with Ajays excel sheet. 

As for the retainer rings. The first ppl will get one of the ten discs each. But as noted previously, those are crap. 
Anyone who wants a 3d printed one(PETG) will have to come up with just the material costs :) 
Sry, but please understand that I don't want to lose a single cent in this whole process :sweat_smile:

These are the prices for international shipping: https://www.dhl.de/de/privatkunden/preise/preise-international.html
Shipping within EU is 8,89€
Shipping within Germany is 3,89€

To those guys having their pulleys lathed by me. I got all the shipping labels printed and pulleys packed.

Regarding the retainer rings, I had some printed. However the holes don't match up with the pulley.
Any ideas ? I'll check if there are retainer rings without the "prongs". Those who don't want to wait can have their money for the retainer ring refunded and I'll give you one of the discs that was send with the pulleys :slight_smile:
@JLabs could you link me to your printed rings ? Did these fit well ?

All national(Germany) pulleys until now have been sent out today. Pm me if you want your tracking nr :slight_smile:
The bottom of the 3d printed rings look a bit rough. No biggie. Just wanted to tell you. My printer failed with the leftover PETG.

@jm.riviere

The screws/bolts are M5 and need to be at least 65mm I think. Don't nail me down on that :)

I tried the bolts in a local store and i found out that:
-The motor mount need an M6 of 20/25mm
-The flywheel needs M5 bolts. Reading in jlabs group buy, should be 65mm length

@ajaynagra Sadly this is a 42V 2A charger, but I ordered a 4A!!

Just a few questions to you guys: 

1) Where I should connect that volt meter? Do it need some voltage converter or just plug and play thing?

2) I connect my voltage tester to main leads of this 8s4p battery!: so when battery switch is off tester shows 19.8v, but when I turned on that battery switch my tester shows 28v.... wtf? 
 
3) Do that 42v charger will charge my 8s battery, also in near future I'm be upgrading this battery with thin super sexy  8s bms from battery support.com - so do that 8s bms will like those 42v from that charger?

I found that the BMS's used in these packs (at least mine) have to have a load on POS & NEG legs before the voltage reads correctly.  You will notice there's almost no AMPS even when there is no load.  I don't know why, But it's normal.[quote="ninja, post:1633, topic:13419"]

If you are lucky. Just open it up and look if there is a potentiometer inside. Maybe you can adjust it to 33,6v. But I'd think it won't go that low for 8S.

It would be great if you could finally release some information on the packages you have already sent. 
I am still in the dark wether or not you have sent my package or if you need anything from me ... So really don't know shit right now.

Which actually sucks .. since I didn't order any pulley nor a battery hence my stuff should have arrived quite a while ago.

Sadly I tried contacting you several times via private message with no avail until now. So please sort this out and let me know the status

@monkey32
I know you are just trying to help , but this suggestion doesn't solve the question (s) at hand.
- which packages have been sent (is my package sent?)
- if no: what is needed to do so (address ? Money (WTF!?!)) 
- if yes: when was it sent? Is there any tracking?  

@yaca
Thanks for the hint - did you do it via emails?
Can you pass me the details?

@ajaynagra
I've been really patient ... Things can and will not go as expected ( organised some group buys with 100+ people myself), but in the morning be it's also solvable when you communicate. 
I've been chasing you for weeks now ... Again between each message waiting to not spam you. But to what avail? You send packages to people who start PayPal claims or threaten you any other ways ?  There is something seriously wrong with how you handle it currently.
All the time I was thinking that people shouldn't do claims since it will put unnecessary stress on the situation. Right now I have the sentiment and wish I would not have trusted you and either did not join this group buy or at least sent the money via regular PayPal and enforce their claims on you.

If you would communicate .. this wouldn't be needed .. buy after this period of time waiting (and also seeing that you post to other threads in this form) I see little chance in you actually sorting out things.


To everyone else:
I have skipped through posts where people spoke about actions we could take. But I haven't found anything moving forward so far.
Is there a way to start a police fraud claim as non UK citizen? ( Especially with the brexit stuff happening)? Does anyone else here want to get together for the claims and see what action we can take?

This is what I came up with just now. I'll have it cover a bit more area(make it longer). Are there any official measurements or drawings of the motor mount ? I might be able to make it cover all the way up to the back (enclosed).

Here you go guys, let me know how they print out for you, this is for Kegel's. My setup is 16T motor pulley and 36T wheel pulley an it fits great! Use M4 bolts of 20mm length. You will need to tap the holes in the mount for M4, but its is aluminium so you might get away with just screwing into it and self tapping.

Hi all,
just a few general questions for those here:
1. What size/class thread do i need to bolt the motor to the mount?
2. did your motor mounts also require some effort in jimmy-ing to get the onto the truck axle?
3. What is the purpose/function of the soft switch on the bms, and what actually **is** the BMS's details so i can look up what it's capable of. (new to bms's)
```

1. M4 bolts and I recommend washers too. 
2. Depends, my trucks are the black calibers and I had to file off some paint for them to fit. They fit perfect on the raw calibers I have though.
3. Not sure

The bms can deliver 77amps at 10s, that's probably even more than what you usually need (a 10s3p of 25r can only deliver about 60). It's quality stuff, already used a bit in a group buy some months ago. Haven't heard anyone having issues with that
BTW, my order has been sent out yesterday, I had a battery to ship to Europe, didn't open a claim and got a tracking code.

So i received my package today, it was sent on the 13th
Everything seems to be here, except for the belts (I also paid for extras, that's kinda annoying. More annoying is that I told him to check everything and send me a list of what was inside before shipping)
BMS is huge, battery very compact. Did your bms have an e-switch attached? Mine didn't and i wanted it, but that's ok. My battery, sine bms was detached, didn't even have connectors coming out, i guess I'm gonna have to work on it now. Pulleys were from the last group buy, so i can't really say much about those

So just connect whatever switch you like in between the red cable and you have your eswitch running.

Yep. I just made dispute so i can get even that back if he really isn't going to send my package.

I think that in reality Ajay did use our money to something else than this group buy and that's why he ''miscalculated'' shipping fees. Because were talking now loss of few hundred pounds

## \#1728 Posted by: MartijnTiny Posted at: 2017-04-21T08:52:21.205Z Reads: 97

Yeah, i think you are right. Maybe he spent the money he was supposed to profit before he received the package from China, then the import tax was added to the cost and he calculated the shipping too low. And he expected us to pay for the difference because his "profits" were already gone. If this is true it is a really shady way of doing business. And i still think he should have been honest with us op front.

I think it will be a long time for me before i join in any kind of group buy again due to this experience. I'd rather pay the few extra bucks then go trough all this uncertainty again.

Then he was to lofty to tell the truth about it and decided it´s easier to ignore people instead of working a way out of the mess.

Few days ago I received from @TranxFu the flywheel gear and an excellent 3d printed retainer! It took a while, the italian (and german too xD ) post offices were really lazy, took more than 14 days to reach my door, the parcel waited days in the  sorting centers. He lathed the gear perfectly, it's easy to insert in the wheel and it fits without wobbling inside. In a word, perfect! I still take this chance to thank you @TranxFu :)  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/f/cf84c657710eb8f5ef7ab484c4a8dc4de53398a5.jpg" width="690" height="387">

Hi!

They are 3mm long and have M4 thread. 

But those screws what are in between pulleys teeth can be 6mm long, I think it's better to use all thread for maximum power. And those screws what are on the neck of those pulleys can be 4mm long.

What do you mean with "what kind of BMS is this"?
Up to 77A, 10s, e-switch. I think you have to turn the switch on to charge the battery, and you'll probalby need to solder the display on the circuit

You just solder the leads for the volt meter after the BMS, typically at the XT-90 at the end.  

What most people do is remove the XT-90, wrap the POS meter lead around the POS battery lead, the same with the NEG, an resolder the XT-90 connector.

No clue, don't know which volt meter it is.  Usually there's a button in the back, you hold it down while powering on then hit the button until you get your cell count.

Funny enough, my parts arrived the day after I posted @Tuomalar. Happy that some of it arrived, however the 2 pulley kits, the sets of wheel and charger I paid for did not arrive, that's around 35€ * 2 + 25€ + 29€ = 124€ of missing parts... Is it hopeless to try and get them or what do you guys think? Maybe take a lesson from large group buys and buy directly from vendors... :s

I only lost like 5-10 euros and a lot of time in this, but if I were you and lost 125€, I would stalk him until he gives me what's mine. It's not that he didn't make any profit out of this, motors alone were like 30 € of profit each, batteries 40. I mean, a third of what we paid went directly into his pockets, the minimum he can do is send the right stuff. I understand he got scammed (I mean, he did a stupid move, I can't tell you but it was pretty irresponsible) and underestimated the shipping fees, but he wasn't clear at all with us. You should do something.

Does everybodys bms work properly? I have tired it only 2 times and this time it did leave my batterypack unbalanced. 9 cells were 4.08V and one 4.20V.
I also noticed some drifting. Two cells dicharge and charge more than the others. About 0.1-0.15V

I'm gonna test it as soon as my vesc arrives, should be a question of days. That would be so bad, are you sure everything is wired up? Some balance cables may have detached, I'm wiring mine up from scratch so that's to be excluded 
This isn't the first group buy where this bms has been used, and if I'm right nobody else has had any problem, except the fact that you have to keep it on to charge and it keeps drifting constantly

Hello, I'm a friend of @Tijmen's on this group buy. The parts ordered are for a board that my friend is building for me. There is a slight problem though. We have not received our order from Ajay, who hasn't visited this site since April 25th. Thats 3 weeks Ajay hasn't been online and we still don't know about the status of our order - heck, we don't even know if it exists. If you know anything about Ajay that could help us out in tracking down his contact, would you please PM either me or Tijmen? I paid Ajay, through Tijmen, over 500£ so this is no small problem for me. Again please do let us know if you know _anything_ that could help us contact Ajay.

Sorry my laptop died! Now I can answer you!   So strips are 6mm wide two layers, not sure about thickness. So welder guy put nice 6 weld spots on each cell side, because those original spots were silly! And then he added one layer 8mm nickel strip, I think its 0.17 thickness, but its thicker than origional ones that came with battery. Than I glued all cells together with hot glue to keep battery nice and strong, because it was so loose, I like solid things!😎

Going to do that too. And @SirDiff might be. But all strips were very easy to just pull off. Everyone who bought these should check their batteries.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/9/09b4d49b49c99230d077757bf4fc5681edb01edf.JPG" width="375" height="500">

If anybody needs some belts, I've got 4 12mm HTD 5M 255mm I'm willing to sell. Bought them from @Norco and never used cause my pulley (old group buy gen) is too large :confused: 
3 euros each, pm me if you're interested

How many people are still waiting for stuff? Is it widespread or just a few forgotten ones? Perhaps anyone who hasn't received their stuff could comment on this thread then update the number of people in their comment. (presuming there is more than one) Then people could get an idea if it is a widespread problem or just an isolated incident? (oversight?)

He sent all expect one. So if you haven't got your stuff you should contact hermes and figure out where your pack will arrive. I found mine from local grocery store near by me. But he sent those weeks ago so probably couriers have sent them back to @ajaynagra

@ninja contacted me concerning how the volt meter from this GB works.
Here is what I found out.
While turning on the battery, press the left button on the back. You will enter a menu where you can choose between P, F and L (we need L) and the number of cells you have (1-16). Than long press both buttons and you will enter a new menu. Here you can activate/deactivate 6 different functions. 
1=volt meter automatically switches between volt and % indicator every second. 
2=automatically turns off screen after 5 seconds. 
3=activate/deactivate screen light.
6=changes sth with the voltage :smiley: 
I'm not sure about the other functions but I will let you know when I find out.

not surprised tbh. I have practically replaced everything in this group buy with genuine parts... Except for the motor. Actually I've been getting shorts inside the motor too now...

For the motors you should talk to @JLabs because they are actually from him.

Not sure what I could do for him. I didn't sell the motor or test it before sending it to him.
