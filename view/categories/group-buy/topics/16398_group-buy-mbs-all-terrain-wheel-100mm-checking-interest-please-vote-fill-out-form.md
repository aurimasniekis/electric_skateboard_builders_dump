Dunno

Let's make a poll of what color.....

[poll]
 - I like green, because it's not easy being green (Kermit the üê∏)

 - I like tacos üåÆ a lot!

I'm not sure what the duro on these are. Mine don't say on them. But they are my favorite wheels. They roll over everything. I wouldn't mind getting some more for my other boards.

@Michaelinvegas I filled out this form and the oust form, but let me know if I'm missing on either if those. And if we get to the 40% of mark, I'd probably be in for two sets instead of one.

I know I and the Oz guys have this US address thing out of Washington St... or something 

The plan...unless I can work out something with them... is to accept delivery of all the orders and for me to send them out individually...

If they can do the same as shredlights did...that would save me a bunch .... but I don't think that's gonna be the case

But this is what I do know....

They won't have enough black wheels till March or April...

Also, they are only willing to give 25% off for 30 plus wheels.......

So......

I have gone back and asked if there was some way to pre purchase the amount of wheels we need at a discount....

So, still chipping away at it .....

Keep you posted

Yes sir, just waiting to hear back.  The hot pour form is pretty simple, 1 piece instead of 2 like MBS.  Should make for a stronger tread while using a softer durometer, 75a most likely.  

The issue is the hub.  I can't figure out an inexpensive method of molding them.  Mill or print are the only options I've found so far.

Still researching, looking for ideas.

I wanted to let you guys know you can find MBS wheels for about $60 on Amazon in lame green color. They have really nice ride quality similar to 97mm abecs maybe a little less but they make up for it in light off road capability.

I also wanted to mention (hope you don't mind @Michaelinvegas ) that I have 40t pulleys available for use with 12mm and 15mm belts that fit MBS wheels and flywheels that I purchased in bulk to sell cheap to the community at $15 each and I also have a 15mm 15t steel motor pulley that are priced together at $25.

I just got some samples delivered from the land of mass production (a.k.a. The Republic of China). The space between the bearings was too wide, so it was not possible to screw on a bolt on the truck axle - the width of the weel hub was too wide in other words. It was my fault, I was too lazy to check the dimensions fully.... I asked them if they were willing to make a deaign with a more thin wheel hub. I got them to make a deal where they would make 200 pcs for 10usd a piece. I am working on getting the price further down though. Are any of you interested?

The hub is made of very strong and rigid plastic. I can upload some pictures if you are interested.

MBS' All-Terrain Longboard Wheels open up a new world for longboarders, the one just off the beaten asphalt path. Their super high rebound 100mm X 65mm treaded longboard wheels make them the perfect addition to any longboarder‚Äôs quiver. Whether you're a seasoned longboarder looking for a new challenge, a beginner looking for wheels that will roll over anything, or a campus cruiser who just doesn‚Äôt feel like walking when the pavement ends and grass begins, the Atom All-Terrain Longboard Wheels will get you where you want to go and turn a few heads along the way.

Note: Make sure you are aware of the size of these wheels and the amount of clearance or lack of clearance you might have before you attempt to mount on your board. You might need to add risers or cut some clearance on your deck.

If anyone can source them I'd love a few sets.

"Ride more" shop (evolve France?) outside Paris had a set of green and a set of black in stock when I was there a few weeks back. ‚Ç¨85
I couldn't find them on the website but might be worth dropping them an email if you're desperate.

They vibrate quite a bit with the knobbles and supposedly grip better when shaved.
