I have been chatting with the guys over at TSG to see if we can get a group buy going for the Pass helmet. We need atleast 24 to start, so I wanted to see how much interest there was. I think we could easily achieve this. :star2: 

If this goes through, helmets will ship directly from TSG's USA distributor. I still don't have a set number (price) from them as we only get a few emails per day in. Shipping internationally from their EU or other warehouses should be possible for international customers.

## If you interested leave comment, and state which country you are from

The new TSG Pass is a slim and simple full face helmet. Designed with aerodynamics and rider comfort in mind, it has a wide viewing area, featherlight construction, breathable vent ports, and an organic feel while tucking. It's not just a downhill helmet, it's an everything helmet! Coming in Gloss White/Red, Matte Black, and Carbon

The helmet retails for $269. Stating your interest is not an intent to buy, so even if your considering it, please let me know.

## Current Count: 36!

Update; please fill out this form to enter the group buy: 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCs_O-DvPgLZQ8qzJFLMMtT0pmM4LBr-f4v2azqU6JN-MWfg/viewform?usp=sf_link 

Helmets will be around $180usd (maybe cheaper)

Viewing angle, and I remember someone linking an article about using motorcycle helmets for skateboarding. It basically said that the protection is not in the same impact zones for a skateboard rider, and more for the side of the head for a motor cycle rider... or that's the gist...

It most likely lighter as well, which means better fit. Also, now that I think about it; breathability...

I will post a size chart if we get that 24, but there is no point in collecting them now. @ninja

What I read is longboard specific helmets are safer for longboarding because they are lighter and there is less chance of getting a neck injury. Motorcycle are designed for higher speed crashes so they're bigger and heavier.

I own tsg helmet and a brainsaver helmet. I almost only use a tsg pass helmet because it's such a better riding experience. Visibility is great, it comes with two visors, a clear one that I use at night and a reflective one that I use during the day. The helmet blocks all the wind which makes the riding more enjoyable. I haven't had crash in it thankfully, but I feel well protected. It does get a little warm if you're not moving so if I'm at a stop light I might open the visor which is easy to do. Overall I would definitely recommend

I've been using the TSG pass for about a year now. It's a great helmet. In my research, here's the differences between a motorcycle helmet:

- Viewing angle: you can see more (the lens is far bigger and raps further back towards your ears
- Weight: motorcycle helmets are heavy, this is very light.
- Noise: Motorcycle helmets often reduce noise or completely cut it out. Te TSG pass has vents near your ear that allow sound in. You surprisingly don't hear a lot of wind either, but you can hear a car approaching you from behind for example, or emergency vehicles, which I think is a huge safety plus (more spacial awareness).

I would be down if I didn't already own one. I did hit a corner too hard in the rain and slip out, snapping my neck back and smacking my head into the ground. Surprisingly, theres only a small paint chip on the helmet and my head was 100% fine. Did it's job well, and it will continue to!

It would be of great help if you could ask a quotation for about 40 "pass helmets" (please confirm the quantity @JLabs) shipped from their EU warehouse, so we can avoid tax.
Regarding the US guys, tax for them wont be a problem since they have to pay it only after 800$value. Shipping is also going to be cheap from EU to jlab; for example I can ship 5kg/ 5helmets for 25€ (5€/each) with ups.

And good news right after for Eu poeple. They were happy to oblige (https://www.roll-laden.tv/) and make an inquiry for us. 
talks were a reduction in price between 20-40%, wil get an e-mail with confirmation. They were asking though if we could agree on one color, would again help with the price 8of course different sizes no problem). But he was a little sceptic since 40 helmets or so would depleete the whole of switzerland and the TSG Pass is a small series of a product. I should get an e-mail at the beginning of next week. I will then upload it to google.docs and send you a link for transparency.

would be ideal of course. But apparently TGG doesnßt sell to end users directly. Allways trough and import export business that is local. And at least here you have to be a verified shop to be even able to order trough them. As a citizen it is impossible to deal with them. So was just an other Idea, if it works out and ends up being cheaper for Eu poeple why not ? (also we have only 6.8% taxes on it).

Filled out the form, but I'm only in when it's possible to send from Europe. Cause shipping and import tax will get it back to the original price, if not more.

**PRICE UPDATE**
I searched several eu. resellers and I found really low prices. For 1 piece purchase you can get the full black version for 125€ free shipping to europe. So I believe we can definitely go below that price with 30 pieces.
I am not linking the site here because I would like people to stay in the group buy to get a better deal. @JLabs I PM'd you the link.

That's not even the worst.  At a job I had a few years ago whenever the facilities manager was out if town, for some reason, people came to me to bitch about something.  

I had a friend who was a sign maker, another friend who owned a pool hall.  Put the 2 together and you get a hand chalk wheel with a Midol sign on it...Midol lick.

This came out of the desk when someone started complaining.  The outcome?  People stopped bitching and I had to take a trip to HR 😀.

Carbon helmets are now included in this Group Buy! Price will be about $260 excluding shipping.. 

All helmets are about 30-45 days out as they are shipped by boat and not air. If that still works for everybody let me know. 

For international orders (non USA and Canada) I'm afraid that someone else is going to have to take that over as I am working with the USA distributor.

I will try to calculate shipping asap to gather a final price, as the helmets are shipping to me (the distributor does not ship individual orders). 

Also the price on the standard Pass helmet may have dropped. You may be looking at $180-195 shipped in CONUS.

It's not that. I had a PayPal account,. And I used to use it mainly for selling things online. Forgot about it for a couple of months. And couldn't log in again. When I called up PayPal, they told me that the account was probably hacked, and they couldn't do anything about it. They couldn't even delete the account for me because i can't verify the account anymore or something, the hacker took over the account completely. Apparently the information inside had changed. Had to go through a whole episode of calling my Banks and cancelling all my cards just in case they were in the account. Major inconvenience. Hard to trust them with a new account after that drama.

[quote="evoheyax, post:13, topic:21855"]
've been using the TSG pass for about a year now. It's a great helmet. In my research, here's the differences between a motorcycle helmet:


Viewing angle: you can see more (the lens is far bigger and raps further back towards your ears
Weight: motorcycle helmets are heavy, this is very light.
Noise: Motorcycle helmets often reduce noise or completely cut it out. Te TSG pass has vents near your ear that allow sound in. You surprisingly don't hear a lot of wind either, but you can hear a car approaching you from behind for example, or emergency vehicles, which I think is a huge safety plus (more spacial awareness).


I would be down if I didn't already own one. I did hit a corner too hard in the rain and slip out, snapping my neck back and smacking my head into the ground. Surprisingly, theres only a small paint chip on the helmet and my head was 100% fine. Did it's job well, and it will continue to!

Cut off will be in 1 week (For USA &a Canada as of now) I will then gather a final tally and send it to the distributor. After than I will get a shipping price from him to me, and then calculate the final shipped price to you. I still think the $180-$195 shipped will be the target zone. 

I need to find a better way to communicate with everyone because searching through this thread may be tough. Any suggestions?

I will create a giant PM with everyone who said filled out the form. I need to collect information again as some people only have me a street and no city state or zip.. I will also collect final sizes and colors. 

I will create the PM when I receive a final shipping price from the distributor to me. This PM will only be USA and Canada. I think I am going to hand off the EU people to @fedestanco if he would like to do it.

wait you were using a motorcycl helmet ? Pleason dont tell me its a cc Form without the back part. 
Those things are too heavy and wihtout the motion stopping back part, you can severly injure yourself even in little falls. Since you will allways try to catch your head by reflex, with the added weight, a lot of bad shit can happen.

Basically, what I have learned during the years and was also the recomandation of a lot better donwhill racers and even professionals. A basic tripple eight for instance keeps you safer than a motorcycle helmet.

I am really glad you are getting a TSG though, means I may yet get a Longhaired board, since you will be around long enough for me to get of this student situation :) "kidding"

Just checked the form and found 61 responses! I have contacted TSG again and asked for a shipping quote for 35 helmets from the distributor to me. Once i receive this price I will then calculate the total price for the helmet with all costs included (final price for it to show up at your door via UPS) and then create a massive PM with everyone that has committed to purchasing. There I will have you fill out another form, because some people didnt give me adequate info. Then I will ask for payment and get the ball rolling again. My PM will be only for USA & Canada, and people who responed "I'M IN TAKE MY $180"

If you responded as a MAYBE (and are located in USA or CA) i did not include you on the 35 units shipped to me. So if you changed your mind you need to let me know ASAP. The $180-$195 all in price is still doable..

@michichopf is working on a deal with tsg Switzerland to get a low price anyways (it will probaly be lower than the price US people are getting).

For transparency these are the shops that offer 125€ helmet, but only on some colors and sizes: https://www.snowbitch.com/helmet-tsg-pass-solid-color-flat-black130/d-208988/

Thats impossible unfortunately. Some shops are offering such a low price (125€) just because they are clearing their tsg stock.
If they have your size in stock I suggest you to buy from them asap since the quantity is very limited.

Hey for transparency here is how far I am i dealings with Tsg headquarters.

Price: 6500.-(CHF) for 40 helmets making it 162 CHF / 147 euro a pop. 
Colours: Black, white, red avaivable in your size

Shipping: still working in who pays how much for what. I am trying to get them to pay for shipping and also handle the process. If not i will upload a google docs with all the information you might need.

Special: in order for my local freeride shop to handle the deal, since you arent allowed to deal with them as a privat person, I managed to lower their cut to almost nothing,  BUT they will stick on a sticker representing their store with a 8x4 cm sticker on a place of our choosing. With proper liquids removable though.

This is not final, and they are slow in communication sadly. I am pressing them for a final offer, the amount of sizes avaivable in eatch color etc. To moove this along.

Ok a rather large update, I got final prices for the helmets, but not a final shipping cost from the distributor to me. There is also an 8% sales tax we must pay for the helmets. So yeah, not much I can do about that. 

Shipping via UPS with $200 insurance is $24.07. Then shipping each helmet to me was estimated at $17.50/helmet. So shipping charges are the bulk of the price. 

I also got final color options:

Pass solid color helmets are available in 
Satin white
Satin black
Satin purple
Satin fire red

Pass Pro Carbon graphic are available in 
Shoot graphic
Trace graphic

As of now shipped price to you is $189 (solid color). The sales tax is the cause of the increase.

I will have carbon pricing soon and will add that to the giant PM I will create tonight. 

Regarding payment; I can only accept PayPal via friends and family. If you think about it 35 x 189 = $6,615. I simply cannot take that financial risk of people creating disputes. To combat this I added the $2 insurance to the all ready reliable UPS which covers $200 of lost/stolen/broken goods. I realize that some of you may be weary of friends and family payments but I have all ready ran over 4 group buys and run a small eSk8 business. I'm not going anywhere. I will also clear my PayPal of any funds and post screenshots of the transactions on a weekly basis if that would help at all. 

I will most likely create the PM to tonight. I will have strict rules for it to keep it organized and easy to read. There will be another form for you to fill out (correctly) and I will ask for payment. Then after 5-6 days I will submit final orders to TSG and then wait out their restock. 

Ok I thinks that's all for now... 🤹‍♀️

I think you must charge tax to anyone who lives in the state the business resides in.  Otherwise it's up to the individual to self-report to their home state.  Unless you want to look up each state and send them a check for the tax on each transaction.  Not an accountant/tax person, so take it FWIW.

Unless you're in DE or another state, where there is no sales tax...

You probably do not meet the minimum revenue thresholds for the purposes of the tax code. Usually you have to do X$ in busines in a particular state to be required to collect sales tax.  Otherwise the responsibility is on the buyer to self report like akhlut mentioned.

I got mine today from Snowbitch.cz and the original packing box from TSG is really really underwhelming. The helmet can move freely in the box and the only packing material is a 2mm foam sheet. The manuals and extra visor is also just thrown inside.

My helmet has several dents and scratches and I've contacted the reseller for advice on how to resolve it.

@JLabs @fedestanco: You should talk this over with the distributor before they ship because worst case, there will be a lot of returns for you to deal with.

same here! Took 2 from snowbitch. One was already out of the box and assembled, the other was was in parts. Also few scratches and I´m really disapointed by overall quality. If you compare that 200€ worth helmet with a 200€ motorbike helmet, it´s really not the best quality imo.
I assembled the other one and the visor wouldn´t close properly, so I took it apart and one of the closing mechanisms looked weird, so I took the other one apart and saw that the one was cracked. I could fix it with a few drops of superglue, so that the visor is closing now properly. Of course I´m going to write them about these issues. Seems like the whole batch is a B-Grade.
About the size: I took L 58-60cm because I measured two times 59cm. But it´s really close of beeing too tight. And I tried both L helmets - same issue.
So my advice: Calculate 1 or 2 cm plus the size you measured to get a nice fit.
Other than that, it looks cool and seems like a good helmet.

purchasing proper cardboard boxes from Uline
[/quote]

oh man... uline has all of my money. Watch out for shipping though, they only ship using two options: get it tomorrow or get it in two days. That being said, shipping is expensive, but worth it if you're buying a lot of things like boxes. They're where i get my boxes and most of my organizational stuff like bins for small parts. Also they're literally the only place to get certain box sizes like the ones i use for shipping completes.

Just checked and it's $30, about doubles the price of the boxes. I may be able to pick them up as they ship from a warehouse near me. I may call them to see if I can do that.

yeah. it can be kind of silly. I get 25 boxes for complete builds at a time and they're only like $2.50 each but then the shipping is like $60. lol

Wow, it's a shame to see TSG still packing them sooo poorly.. a $5 helmet comes packed in foam cutouts made specifically for that helmet, and they can't do that for a $200+ helmet? They must waste more helmets than they actually used. I had to return mine once, and the second one still had scratches on the lens (on the inside, they put a film on the outside of the lens, but not the inside. The buckle floats around and scratches the inside of the lens in the mean time during shipping...). It's so poorly packaged for shipping, but if you can get one without to much damage, they are great helmets.

Yes, I ordered it through amazon. The  problem is not so much how amazon packs it, which is not great either, but how TSG packs it. Theres literally no protection if the box is thrown around, which almost always happens, so it will almost always arrive damaged. No air bags, no peanut, no foam, nothing. Just a helmet that rolls around in a box. But amazon did fix it. They ended up giving me like 60 bucks off in the end, which I was cool with for a few minor scratches.

The TSG you saw me wear had scratches. The red print from the logo bleeded so I had to wash it off with a cloth. Had some scratches on the inside of the visor and the main body as well. Still a great helmet tho

That kind of packege definitely wasent intended for postal shipping! If I were you @TarzanHBK @rwxr I would pretend at least a partial refund for such damage.

Regarding the GB I have just pm'd @michichopf for updates. @ninja there is no need to use this tone. I am a customer like you; I volunteered to handle shippings in europe, nothing more (and btw I am not keeping a cent for the job). We will emphatise to the seller that this kind of quality is unacceptable and that helmets need to be bubble-wrapped.

Will post further updates the same day as I get them.

Don't know how they could send me a new one, since they are out of stock. I think I will try to get a partial refund instead and cover up some of the marks with a sharpie.

I tried to build an electro magnet yesterday to get rid of the alarm tag, but I had no luck so I'm gonna go to some clothing store and ask if I can use their system to remove it.

I just wanted to leave another update here. I have been back in forth with the distributor and am finalizing the details. As for the payments, I will no longer be using PayPal. All orders will be placed & processed through my new Shopify website. There you will only be able to use a Credit Card or Apple Pay. 

For anyone who wants to join, just fill out the google form. I will then send a mass email out to everyone with a link and instructions to purchase your helmet. 

I also wanted to add, I have asked the distributor to carefully inspect each helmet for dings/scratches/defects, and to add more bubble wrap to the helmets to prevent damage during shipment.

Okay so I was chatting back and forth with the distributor and asked for a final stock count so I didnt sell anything that I couldn't actually receive stock of. Unfortunatley he had someone buy every single last helmet in the black color. So if you want a helmet and can pay in 5 days or less you need to respond ASAP. I will then reserve the helmets and then collect payment. Below is a stock count of what he has available.

I need everyone to confirm/reserve today if possible. The sooner the better so I can officially reserve the units from the distributor.

@will_manners probably $100+

mine is correct. 

Also slightly off topic but i decided to go ahead and get one from Amazon and use the two i get from here for my son and one of his freinds if they decide to ride. 

Anyway i wanted to comment about the packaging from Amazon. There was discussion about packaging before regarding some people just tossing bare helmets in boxes or whatever. When i got mine today, it was in a TSG labeled box, which tells me Amazon didn't really do anything to the packaging, and that it came from TSG this way. Inside the box was a soft fabric bag holding the helmet and paperwork and things. Inside the bag was a separate compartment holding the second visor, the clear one, which was wrapped in paper. 

So maybe TSG has improved something. Here's hoping.

I'm out.

I would really have to try one on before I commit since it is nonreturnable. I am going to have to see if there is a skate shop in the vicinity that has one I could try on. I would have previously done this, but I am too busy with work.

I have had to try on numerous motorcycle and bicycle helmets in the past, before I find one that is comfortable on my fat head. They are often too tight in the front and loose on the sides. I guess I have an oval shaped head.

Thank you for all of the time that you have put into this.

Sadly it looks like a cut and shut job. I know it was cheap but I don't think I can get over the fact that it looks like is is two helmets stuck together and filled badly then sprayed over.
Anyone think this acceptable?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/7/770167c22e4406e9771987d417979f0c8d1097fc.JPG" width="375" height="500">

What is wrong with it?
Only thing I can see is that upper left edge of screen is broken or peels in two parts.
So it seems that we buying TSG failed products or even cheap clones.
I'm very surprised about quality of TSG, it not should be like that. Some of my friends including me have some protective gear from TSG and it's top quality, I can say TSG is good as sixsixone gear.  
But when I see those shipping packing errors, scratches and screen dividing in two halfs, it's making me cry like a small girl.

I'll take another photo or two. It's diagonal from bottom left to top right. The mark throught the helmet isn't a reflection it's a blemish where 2 parts have been seemingly joined? Perhaps I'm expecting too much. A motorbike helmet is perfectly smooth. This is like an egg you get where you feel for the chicken that produced it. All lumpy.

File a paypal claim or ask seller to pay for return.
If the store describes the helmet as brand new, this quality is just unacceptable.

I am starting to feel guilty to have linked these 2 stores. They are pretty big though and sell original stuff. I wonder if its just tsg's fault to provide bad packaging and shitty quality control.

I had problems with my two helmet Snowbitch order, but they solved it nicely!
I had a broken visor-closing-thingy, took a picture and send it to them. They wanted to replace the full helmet first, but i asked just for the broken part to avoid the unnecessary shipping. And they did!
Everything went fast and i got the new part for free.
So I can recommend Snowbitch because of the good customer support!

Yeah I don't get that either.. The only thing stopping it from getting damaged is because the boxes fit tightly together and are secured Together by the large box.

I checked all of the helmets and none of them have scratches or shipping marks. I did notice that some of the helmets have the same crease marks as @bigben but not as severe.  You can only notice it when looking directly for it, and at the correct angle.

Holy crap that crease mark looks horrible! I wonder what the back story is on that. If @JLabs mentioned other helmets has similar marks, does that mean the helmets are built with two pieces and then covered/coated? If that's the way it's designed then at least this would not be a safety issue.

My bet is that they have a mold for the largest size and then they trim along that seam for smaller sizes. Their whole competitive advantage is that they sell different sized helmets for different sized heads...not the same helmet with different sized padding. I think we now have some insight into how they accomplish that because having 4 different molds might be more expensive from a production standpoint.

Hi, if you tell me your size I may be able to point you in the right direction. 
Given the fact that prices are already very low on any size apart from M, I dont know if its worth making a group order.

Actually none of the XL helmets have it. It's mostly large and a small amount on mediums. It is very minimal and you cannot notice it when just plainly looking at the helmet.

Okay so everything is ready to rock.

It was my first time using Shopify/Shippo so the first 5 people had a small issue. They are:
Dave D
Ash G
Adam A
William C 
Matthew M

It did not add the insurance on the package so I had to void the label. Once the void is granted you will receive another email with the new tracking number. Sorry for the hiccup.

Everyone else, the email you received is the correct tracking. Packages will be sent tomorrow unless the void takes longer than expected.

Recommended to pack it well before sending our, they didn't do it. Package was a bit beaten up, but the helmet itself looks fine. Arrived in about a week. Feels great, I still have to try it on the road though!

Hey - helmet arrived. @Jlabs great job man, it was nice and well protected.

Unfortunately my head is too big for the helmet :frowning:. When I was looking at the sizing I was at the upper limit. Not sure what the protocol is here with group buys, not sure if it can be returned or if reselling is taboo - let me know. Fits my son though:

The helmet not being comfortable on my big head was a concern. I believe they are not returnable. What size is your head? Mine measures 23.75" - 60.325 cm but is somewhat oval. A lot of helmets I try on are tight on my forehead even though I fall within the size range. I was going to get an XL in white but I backed out because of possible fitment issues.

@psychotiller, I dunno - I just put white XL on the survey. Did you maybe select a carbon? I think those had limited sizes. And yes, my head is too big for XL. My head is really big. 

@Jetskimark, around the crown of my head I'm ~60.5cm. The sizing says it fits up to 61cm. 

I was able to put on the helmet just barely and I definitely wouldn't be able to wear it for long durations. It was like my head was in a vice. Damn shame cause it looks cool as hell.  I want that @okp look.

And about 5 minutes after I took this I fell for the first time.  Nothing serious, but the helmet saved my face. 
[Scene of the crime - damn I hate concrete roads.](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.2872432,-74.5627392,3a,60y,263.67h,68t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9Gxc-cuDTCKI87GwZ4LVgg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)
It was getting dark and a car was coming up from behind, so I went to get over and misjudged the transition between the concrete and asphalt - the asphalt was about 1 1/2" lower than the concrete.  I knew I was in for a bad time, and I tried to slow but not enough and tripped on the board as I jumped off.  Literal yard sale - emptied my pockets and my stuff was everywhere.  Freaked the drivers out. Jumped up and was surprised I wasn't hurt.  Awesome.  Board gave me a scare, but  it was the GT2B which needed a reset - all is well.  Cruised home after that.
The aftermath:

```
well... as some of my customers know already... i spent the last couple of weeks up north doing family stuff. 

Virginia's hills are a motherfucker. BAsically i found the flaw in my current board's brake settings. On steep hills if the min current on the battery is too high your brakes will gradually go out untill you're just free coasting. 

I went into a free coast on a hill about a mile from the Blue Ridge Parkway. I was flooded with adrenaline and ready to ride it out. Got my crouch on, ankles stable and holding steady.. doing 35+ when the brakes stopped resisting entirely. Probably hit that rock with my back kegel doing about 40mph and went into a slide i didn't recover from. 

Rang my damn bell. When the world stopped spinning i stood up, steadied myself for a minute because i know what a concussion is and how it feels, took several deep slow breaths, stopped the planet from tilting, brushed myself off, grabbed my board and walked back up the hill. 

TSG heklmet + Revzilla kevlar jeans and shirt + some paddier vans lace up hightops. 

All i got was a dizzy spell and a bloody palm. And the fucking clothes are fine, like nothing happened. 

@chaka basically saved my life by telling me about that revzilla shit, and @okp contributed by making me want that fucking space helmet so bad.

Holy shit! Talk about just in time delivery! Thanks for sharing! I'm also planning on an armored hoodie for motorcycle riding. When I get the Raptor 2, I'm going to start using it to commute 1 day/week and I will feel better about pushing the speed if I have that protection

Your story makes me feel even better about this purchase.

The EU group buy is dead. Most people bought from the linked shops easier in the thread.

I got an email yesterday from TSG, I can do another group buy but I am going to have to raise the price because the amount of packaging material I have to use is crazy and it is very time consuming. 

Price would be $205 if there is still interest at the price I will do it.

Hey man what size was your head? My head is 67.5cm and the medium sits between 66 and 68cm

I wonder if I should go with the large one which goes between 68 and 70cm

I wonder if people have found the helmet to run small or matches the size chart perfect

Site had listed 61cm for their XL (circumference of head). Mine is 60. I was able to get it on, but it pressed on my cheeks and crown really hard and was very uncomfortable - too small for me.

Our heads are about the same size, I got a medium but have tried on a large. The large is a bit more comfortable while not being too loose for me. I would go a size up if your that close the cutoff.

I waited long enough and just bought one the other day. I was looking at the $219 on eBay for a while but just couldn’t go purple. Went with the “gold” one. 

Just received it and I really need to lose weight. The XL is painful to get on and off. I took off the cheek pads and it worked well. Might just ride without those since it would make it really hot anyway now that it’s getting warmer

Your right. I wonder if smiling counts as an exercise because a day of smiling can make my face hurt.

And yeah I got a MTB helmet that is to big Yet its painful to take on and off.
Maybe go Into a helmet store and try out different padding and see what works.

The new TSG USA distributor is having a huge sale right now, but I’m waiting back to see if individual units can be purchased. It seems that you have to buy a case at a time, which may be practical for knee pads, but not for helmets.
