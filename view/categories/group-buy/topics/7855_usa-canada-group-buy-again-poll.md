But isn't there a bulk discount on the R-Spec right now? If you buy a certain amount I believe you can get up to 10% off, not to mention its only $100 right now.

Group buys will save 10% and the shipping if you don't have and order that qualifies....

Don't know anything abt the sale

I don't know much about it other than what I read in the forum post quickly... Personally I don't really need an R-Spec, but people who are looking to buy one could benefit from it.

If you are doing a group buy from liionwholesale I would be happy to spear head it. I organized the last one and it went quite well. Not to mention they are an hour or two away.

I am kind busy now with some **HUGE** things in the works, but im sure i could find time for the batteries.

@Michaelinvegas for the sake of things, I think @JLabs should pick it up, save on shipping to the group buy organizer, but I don't have a preference who hosts it.

We just need to see where everyone's head is at...we just did an Enertion group buy ...and a mini remote ...and maybe a mini re-do of each....

If you wanna take on the battery thing I have no issue...but I'd do a poll on the battery that the group buy will interested in ... @Namasaki did well with his basen batteries ...and of course the samys and the LGs .... Not to mention the 26650 sizes .....

So....this should be discussed on another thread if we can or PM first

Since this is a general group buy thread, I will spill the beans. I cant keep it back any longer. 

I am working on a group buy / pre order for 6354 / 6374 190kv censored motors. All black stealth looking beauties. Should have details tomorrow, with steep discounts. Here is a sneak peak. :point_down:

I'd be interested in a 26650 or 18650 group buy. I'd be willing to organize it if @JLabs is busy with the motors and @Michaelinvegas is busy with the Enertion group buy.

There seems to be a lot of interest on a battery group buy. I will put a thread together with polls for what battery (manufacturer, capacity). I am also going to finish up talks with a motor supplier and start a group buy for them to. 


We are soon going to need a while separate forum for group buys.
