Edit: this is now over, sorry for anyone who missed it

I got everything approved and I can purchase individual units from the new TSG USA distributor. I want to do this Group Buy so everyone can get their hands on safety gear. That said, last time I did this it took my a huge amount of time to sort and distribute everything. Because if this I will be adding a few dollars to the cost. The prices are still insanely low. I need your help tho as I am totally swamped with work today. Can you guys go find sizing charts and pair them here? It would help a lot! 

TSG full protection set will be $40 in small, medium and large. 
![image|500x500](upload://kBsAgJTnC7HCbCeLNY0o8TCo6Dl.jpeg)

TSG Pass in white, purple, black and yellow. All sizes available. $145
![image|500x500](upload://gCNAtqsTvzu0p7WWxmaANJ0V0kh.jpeg)

Sometimes I like to ride without full face, so I am adding the TSG Superlight helmet as well. All sizes available. $35 for small and medium, $42 for large and XL.   
![image|500x500](upload://v4uvnD84adozV3yULU0w7nhNidE.jpeg)

I will also be fronting the cost of this as I don‚Äôt want the items to go out of stock. Shipping is probably $15 instead of seven for helmets so add that to the price as well. I need someone to help manage this as I will be busy af today. 

Purchases will be on my website, **AND ONLY THROGUH CREDIT CARD** as paypal says I made too much money last month and is holding it. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm legit and my website is www.buildkitboards.com **(products not available yet)**

Payment will happen tonight, just wanted to get this out there. Please stay tuned and be swift with the payment as I will place the order ASAP to secure stock.

Edit: if the EU wants in on the pads I can do so, but shipping will be about twice as much. Canada is also welcome if you pay the shipping cost.

## Ordering will begin at 5pm EST and end at 9PM EST tonight! 

I am doing this because stock is diminishing and I want to get it ASAP

Prob. too late but former world champ Kevin Reimer developed some knee pads with TSG for down hill that wrap around the side of your knee not just cover the knee cap... maybe in the future you could include those they are the bomb :bomb:

I know deckybro is a fan :star_struck:

Yes the pro-line uses carbon to be lighter, and also the cheek pads are magnetic instead of snap in, for easy removal during injury

Ah gotcha. Yea these are the knee pads you buy so you never have to buy knees again. I went through many over the years, most dying because the strap after the first fall. I've fallen with these and use them as pivot points in slides. They're a total solve all for knees.  

Anyway talking to locals. Might be down for 2-4 passes.

Let me know a deadline you need an answer by...

@akhlut all TSG pass come with the chrome mirror and a translucent.

I have one of the smoke visors, it gets some glare compared to the chrome mirror.  Unfortunately I've never seen the smoke offered with the helmets, since it already comes with the best two - a day and night visor.

But yeah...Acid Yellow is gonna be my new night ride helmet lol

That's exactly why I want it.  Straight up visibility.  

Don't get me wrong - I love the chrome and the clear.  I think the smoke would look awesome on this helm though.  More menace, less Daft Punk.

I've tried on a couple of TSG PASS in XL and they are a little snug, but it fits as well as the 888...but no one ever had the colors I want in stock so now I'm getting a TSG Pass for me and my kid in XL as well.

I basically get XL all the time. Before I bought the TSG, I bought the Ruroc because of their sale. The Ruroc was literally painful when the three parts are on and it was a pain in the ass get on and off. 

The TSG Pass was hard to get on as is. I struggled to get the top on my head in but eventually pops on. I took off the cheek pads and it now slides on with ease. I wrapped the pads in a bag and compressed it with the weight of my couch for a few days. Worked, but it plumped back up after a few hours

I‚Äôm now just using the TSG without the cheek pads.

It says your down to ship to Canada if the customer covers the cost of course. Just wondering about the actual shipping method as UPS or FedEx will tag on an extra hundred bucks in brokerage charges where USPS packages just get handed off to Canada post with no charges.

If ya can let me know what your planned shipping method to Canada would be that'd be awesome. 

Also if there's anything ya want help with I'd be more than willing to lend a hand in some fashion.

I found the measurement to be spot on for me. I'm a medium and measure in the middle of the medium range. However, sometimes the shape of your head makes a difference. If you are worried about it, see if there is a local skate shop that carries this helmet. You could try one on to check for size. Otherwise, take your best guess and if you are wrong, you can easily resell it without taking a loss. These prices are better than anything around for that helmet.

@JLabs thank you for setting this up, this is awesome! I have a Pass from your last group buy and I love it, now I'm thinking I need a second as a spare and for guests!

@Ebisane9 thx for this insight I was wondering if these would be better than the S9 kit that I have. I'm guessing that they are way better!

He said that he will use USPS for most orders, so you can estimate here:

Pretty sure he is in Pennsylvania, so you can use 15106 as the domestic zip code.

@that0n3guy I'm the same... by the measurements I could use M or L. I bought L and I love it, M felt too tight, although still usable. At some point it comes down to the shape of your skull and head overall. I'd suggest L if you're in between.

## XL Helmets

For those who ordered size XL. I just put down $2k on them. But they didn‚Äôt have as much stock as needed. This was bigger than anticipated and it takes 2 days for the money to reach my bank account, thus I couldn‚Äôt place one order. I purchased the things that were low on stock. 

But two people won‚Äôt be happy. 1 XL black and one XL White were out of stock. If any of you are willing to change it with purple please let me know. That is the only XL size left. If you want to pay more for a Pass Pro Carbon let me know as well and I will tell you the exact price for the upgrade (not as much as you think). Only people who ordeee XL Black or White are eligible for this.

Edit: the black XL has been taken care of. Now I need a white XL.

I ordered and xl acid yellow helmet and would be more than willing to upgrade to a carbon or take a purple or something but from what I gather that won't really help ya unless someone who has a white wants a yellow instead. 

If there's anyone here with an XL white that would be willing to trade for a yellow so everyone gets a helmet that'd be awesome. If not someone's gonna be a lil disappointed :frowning:

The order will ship Tuesday-Wednesday and due to the size will be shipped freight. I‚Äôm guessing that will take a week or so. I will then need at least a week to individually ship all the orders.

Hi, is there anyone that want to take over my order?

I initially paid 59 for the set(m), 190 for the pass(L, Black) and 33.39 for shipping. Now I need to pay another 42.66 for shipping, bringing the total to 325.05. (which is substantially more than buying it here in the Netherlands due to free shipping) 

Since shipping is cheaper within the US, perhaps someone wants to take over my order.

Honestly I didn't know this was a group buy and I just ordered it on the website. I can't get a refund so if someone wants to take over my order it would help me a lot.

Helmet arrived, and i went for my first ever longboarding experience (as a push board, still gathering esk8 parts). i need way smoother and flatter tarmac to practice properly, and i cant get the hang of pushing the board at any kind of speed, like how to re-position my foot for it while maintaining balance. barely got above 8mph

![image|453x500](upload://4gSOizJVcJ52I4iaIAaen64teHx.jpg)

the helmet is a tight fit. i can get it on and off without trouble but it feels pretty darn snug, i imagine it'll break in over time and feel much better
i was expecting a buckle strap, not this weird like, double loop thing with a clasp, wonder if you can add in a real strong buckle instead
it does impact your vision but to be honest the peripheral is fine, my issue is it blocks a lot of my lower vision so i need to look way down to see the front of my board
glasses fit fine, no pain or pressure at all

quick note that a Sena 3S fits in this thing really well, and the interior padding is held on with snaps so its easy to route the wires

only problem is the speaker bits are really far into those cups, might need to add a little foam stand-off to make the speakers closer to my ears

The Sena is essentially just a Bluetooth headset with limited Rider to Rider communication. You'd be better off just doing a Skype call on phones.

It's a speaker set, not earbuds, so plenty of outside sound is let in, in fact possibly too much, at max volume in a quiet room they aren't that loud, they need to be real close to your ears

I thought maybe some of you have the same issues I have with the TSG Pass. I've been thinking about changing the buckle because with gloves on it was really annoying to strap it on. For a while I was looking at Fidlocks' magnetic clasps, but it would require sewing and probably cutting which I didn't want to do.

Today I discovered this "Echo Quick Release" buckle. It's a bit pricey, but requires no cutting of the strap. I'll be picking two up for my helmets.

I have been chatting back and forth with TSG, I will have info on Monday on timeline for delivery. They are basically out of stock everywhere and they would need to be ordered. Likely 4-8 weeks for delivery so I will do a $50 deposit to reserve a color and size and then have the total due when the helmets land in the USA. 

I will continue to update this topic until details are finalized, after everything is together I will make a new one.

Got word that only black helmets are available, but they can ship in 2 weeks. A different color requires 90pcs to be made. 

I will likely do a GB for the Black Pass, Basic Protection Kits, DHP pads, and Superlight/Evolution Helmets. More info in the coming days.

With the additional shipping charges from last time, the price is actually almost the same. International orders, the shipping price calculated at checkout is correct (around $33)
