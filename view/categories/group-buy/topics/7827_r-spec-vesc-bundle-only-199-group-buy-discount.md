## ENERTION R-SPEC 6355 MOTOR & VESC - GROUP BUY OFFER
**LIMITED OFFER  >**[ **NOW ONLY $199USD**](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-190kv-electric-skateboard-motor-bundle-sale/)

As some of you already know Enertion HQ is in Australia, So I normally keep stock of motors & vesc in the Enertion HQ warehouse in Australia then ship them 1000's of km's to each of my customers.

However, this is very inefficient and adds to the cost of the individual item! Also, means higher shipping charges & also for my loyal overseas customers often means really high import taxes!!

So over the last few months we have been working hard to try to optimize our supply chain and we are now very excited to announce we have now established distributors in **Belgium & United States** that can ship to our customers much faster & at lower prices.

So now we need to stock up the warehouses with enough stock to meet the growing worldwide demand for the **notorious R-SPEC 6355 motors** that are well loved by many builders of EsK8 worldwide. [Check out all the user builds that are using the R-SPEC motor.](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search?q=r-spec%20category%3A10)


We have a large production order that's just started with our factory and to help us work out the quantity we need to send to each country we would like to offer the hottest deal yet - **Order your R-SPEC now at heavily reduced prices!!**

You can buy just one if you like and still it's a very great price..... there is no special requirements for purchasing.

However if you want even more savings you can order larger qty and get the additional benefits of the bulk discount. This is good for groups buys.

Does your EU warehouse mean we can soon get motor mounts from there as well? On your website it still says "Australia Post" when I try to order one and the shipping cost is almost as high as the entire mount (which keeps me from buying one).

Yes. Soon all the products can be sent from my distributors. Bit it takes time. It also take some planning and systems. Little steps.

do you have a time frame? One month, half a year, 2017? Just figuring out if I should wait or go all DIY and build my own mount again.

We have all the stock of motor mounts already in Australia, so it must be shipped from here.. The only way these distributor deals work is if the goods get sent direct to distributors from my factories... and they only way I will consider doing that is if I know the stock will be sold.... due to limited cash flow of this business it is not easy to triple my stock holding to fill my overseas distributors warehouses.... little steps must be taken.

Comon guys this is an amazing deal! Glad to read that Jason - good idea and hopefully that will help the EU (but I'm sure the US distributor as well ;-)) to have some items onstock here,

Looking forward to sent the first batch from here :) 

Thanks,
Quentin

Super deal Jason, will take advantage of it soon. How many motor mounts do you need to send to your distributor for it to make sense? Maybe we could group buy as well!

## UPDATE:

**SHIPPING OF THIS DEAL IS BEING DELAYED UNTIL END OF OCTOBER**

_I apologise for not communicating earlier we have had [major storms](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/adelaide-residents-warned-to-go-home-ahead-of-bad-weather/7888826) in Australia and [no power](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/worsening-conditions-cause-more-blackouts-across-sa/7887020) at the end of last week, then have been on a holiday in Australia & also china factories have been on holiday too, so we got a bit behind schedule._ 

**A Quick Summary:**

This deal was offered primarily to help our customers across the globe purchase our products at heavily reduced prices & avoid the huge tax charges. 

**Unfortunately, as of the 30th September, this deal has fallen short of its target unit volume!**

We need a certain volume to make it viable to ship to Europe & US warehouses with duties prepaid at the advertised sales price. Sending small batches doesn't really work as freight charges are much higher per unit meaning you all will need to pay more.

If anyone is interested I can send these bundles direct your door & you can pay the duties & taxes, it's likely to add 30% for europe customers, but you get it faster? Let me know if you are happy to pay extra and ill make it happen ASAP.

Otherwise please sit tight & ill happily pay your duties for you however slightly longer wait then originally anticipated 

**So, I'll be extending this offer for another two weeks - PLEASE SHARE IT WITH YOUR MATES**

Looking at the sell through rates I am certain that we will get the numbers we need and keep our prices low & cover the import duties. Then we also need some time for the international logistics process & customer clearance to occur. **So our new delivery target is end of October.**

The team at enertion thank you all for your support, we could not exist without the support of our loyal customers who help us make these deals possible.

Jason,

I am aware that this is an old thread, but I pre-ordered this bundle to the US on October 11th from your site expecting to have my board finished within a month. I know that you are running a small operation and I love everything you have and are doing for the E-Board community, but I am still curious why there have been no updates on these pre-orders. When I look at my orders I can see that "This order is marked as Awaiting Fulfillment" and that the "1 x Electric Skateboard Motor 6355 & VESC Bundle Arrives at international Distributor on the 31st of October." but no kind of updates on delays. In short, what I am asking is if there is any way I can cancel this order, get my money back, and order these components separately. Alternatively if my order is in the proccess of being fulfilled then it would be great to know and get some kind of update. 

P.S I cant find any kind of contact email on enertionboards.com so I just decided this was my best bet.

Thanks,
M

it will ship this month, probably later this week.

I suppose I can have an educated guess at a date if you want, but there are way too many variables so tends to be pointless.

So let say 21st November it will ship to you.

you are not wasting my time at all....

however, it is always surprising when people wait a long time for their order, then the week it is due to ship they cancel it because they can't wait... seems a bit counter intuitive.

Also note, placing another order will not necessarily get there faster, it will probably cost you a lot more also. especially import duties.

Welcome to the hobby. You're learning quickly that having patience for parts is one of the bigger factors of building esk8s lol there are some people here who will sit on a half assembled board for months and then just sell it
