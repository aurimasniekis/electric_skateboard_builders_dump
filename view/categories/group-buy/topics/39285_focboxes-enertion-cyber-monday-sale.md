for those looking to get one or two focbox during enertions cyber Monday sale and are coming in under the 200eur threshold for free shipping, you're more than welcome to piggy back on my order. 

shipping from me to you, within the US, is $4.50.

On the site it says 200$, maybe its lower for EU folks.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/3/93d5ab40a06985471dda52079098987c780b1765.jpg" width="690" height="387"> for me.

I asked on the enertion chat if there is a limited amount on the sale and the reply was....

"We will take all orders and ship them out gradually"

So I guess that there could be some wait for some parts. Just be aware if anyone does an EU group buy that there will very likely be import charges applied as they ship from China with a reputable courier who will clock the value of these parts.
I also asked if all parts will ship together and was assured that all parts will come from together from China. (so just 1 import charge)

4 pcs 30Q cell with 3ah each = 12ah
80% charge (9,6ah) in less then 2 hrs => 5A charge

for 10S4P of 30Q that would be 12A.

A 12A charger would be enormous :slight_smile:

That's the thing, a "fast charger" will not "fast charge" your cells due to having so many in parallel. 4A on a 4P pack means it's just 1A per cell... so not even close to the 4A rating for fast charging a single 30Q cell. 

When we charge with a 2A charger that's only 0.5A per cell on a 4p pack...

When I asked support before ordering I was told they should be packaged and sent within 7-14 days and then arrive 2 or 3 days after that.
But who knows since the support person also told me to use 2short2push to get 10% off the order...
I also noticed the shipping options have been updated since I ordered.  
It now has 3 options listed for Australian post, Standard, express and courier.  When I ordered it just listed the one option or free shipping and said nothing about Australia.

I'm so glad we are not all DIY anymore.

We made a controversial decision and gave our motor mount designs away for free so others could make them...

We made many other huge decisions. Like making the most powerful direct drive electric Skateboard and taking on the big boys in the complete market.

Moving away from selling so many diy parts to focusing just on a few key parts has made our business 1000x stronger...

For example, When was the last time you heard anyone complain about enertion customer service etc? 

We have improved in so many areas since moving away from diy. The key is focusing. 80/20 rule.

Also, remember we are not out of the DIY scene completely, Got plenty of stock of the stuff that is critical for quality  / reliable builds - the hard to source parts in highest quality, such as focbox.

November 2017 is biggest revenue month on record! Onwards and upwards.

What about bank transfers, you do not accept that either.  
Just had some issue with my cards not working online yesterday and could not complete my sale of 2 Focboxes. That alone makes me not want to buy from you if you do not give payment options. 
Because you have kept the price today as well, I have wired the funds to my nephew to make the sale with his credit card, as they are for him in the first place.  But you did loose me as a future customer, just FYI and feedback.

It's not a direct drive because it's not directly driving a skateboard wheel.  It **IS** a skateboard wheel.  Carvon are direct drive.  Raptor has hub motors instead of back wheels.

Guys!

I heard some of you guys want to hold your shipment as you will be not there to accept the goods. 
So there is a possibility, Please contact Enertion Support via live chat or email and advise us to put your order(s) on hold and provide a date. We will hold your shipment.

Should Enertion keep at those price I suspect sales of other 4.12-derived h/w will phase out altogether and although a lot less profit per item the market share will just eat the whole pie, then there will be VESC6 and derivatives huh

Which leaves me with a quandry what to do with the extra 4.12 Vesc boxes I bought

We can't track ours either. They gave us a China Post tracking number that isn't valid, and support just says "it's shipped". Odd because all my previous orders from them have been DHL and the tracking worked immediately.

Kinda frustrating. Because normally when a tracking number is provided you can at least see the label was made, or that it's awaiting details or shipment... But this tracking hasn't become a valid tracking # for 8 days in any form...

I have contacted support a few times about why I can't track my package yet, even though it has been listed as "shipped" since 5th December.

First time I contacted them I was told that it was sent standard post, and not with express since it was sent with the Enertion free shipping from ordering over $200USD.
Since it has been sent standard post, it can't be tracked until after it has left customs.

Second time I contacted them was a few days ago since I still can't track my package.  This time I was told it should be trackable by the end of the week.  When asked when my package would actually arrive, I was told they have a lead time of 15 days.  So I confirmed that my package should arrive by the 20th and was told that was correct.

Believe what you will from that, I don't hold much hope so will have to just wait and see.

I ordered motors from banggoods on cyber Monday and they shipped the next day and still haven’t heard anything either.  Maybe it was the North Koreans they took all of the focbox to create a new toy for Kim Jong Un. I hate when it is free shipping for orders over a certain amount and then it is the slowest way. I feel like if it is over $200 or more it should be express because that is a good chunk of money they could afford to ship it a little quicker. I know some people bought 4 or 5 so that is $500 and it has been almost a month

@onloop @CarlCollins  mind addressing some of this. There's quite a few of us that have ordered from you previously and the tracking numbers have always shown to be valid - even if delayed.

However it's more then a handful of us that seem to have invalid tracking numbers. Not trying to start a commotion, just inquiring for an answer other then support saying "it's shipped" yet...tracking is invalid.

Just heard from them, supposedly the warehouse team was fired and now they have a new team that will start shipping in a week or two.  And that the products are supposedly already manufactured.  I will edit this post later if any of this turns out to not be true.

Just speculation here but who wants to take bets the warehouse crew mailed all the focboxes to the bulk buyers(businesses) and none we're left for black Friday customers 😂

Yes, a great company. But still they advertised this 'amazing' sell on the basis of fast delivery. Any company that sells online knows this is vital for costumer satisfaction. Eskaters rely on fast delivery to fulfill fast build project desires otherwise there is a risk users may lose interest, board goes to the shelve, or worse, he will change the supplier to get the missing items many weeks overdue.

What you're looking for is a "super awesome fantastic premium" customer service.  Kind of like numismatics -- when a coin is graded "Fine" that actually means it's the shittiest grade possible.

In all honesty though, **everything** without numbers in it is marketing jive anyway and wholly meaningless

I could give a shit less about the time frame.
 It can take all the time in the world to get here.

My concerns are I have a tracking number that isn't valid and hasn't been valid since it was emailed. And there has been no response other then "it's shipped. 

In my experience...if it's shipped and a tracking number is given. It typically becomes valid within 24hours. It's been two weeks and the package still doesn't exist.

I  want an answer as to why I have a bogus tracking number. Not when will I get my parts...

Exactly how I am. The only reason I own two esk8's is to make sure I will always have one that's fully working while waiting on parts for the other. I use mine as my primary form of transportation here in the city so I totally understand the frustration of having to wait for parts. It's a must to stockpile in this industry from what I've learned.

They told me that it will definitely ship by 14th day and it delayed due to the stupid money clip which I didn't even know was included.
And here comes the 14th day which is a Friday but they told me that it won't ship for at least another week due to crazy logistics issue during the holidays. If they don't ship it by next week and it gets delay again, I am gonna issue a request for refund. 
This is getting ridiculous.and I paid 38 AUD for shipping that's no small amount

So let's all learn from this (if this is what's really holding them up)

When running businesses in the future, NEVER tell folks what the free gift will be.  That way you can make last-minute changes at-will and if it's free, then nobody can complain

Yeah I agree, In my opinion just dont tell people there will be a gift and anything extra you give them will make their day, In all honesty the sale was enough for me to want to buy it and the 'gift' was just like a meh ok.

Now If they dont give the gift to speed up shipping times everyone will be like why did you promise it. I also feel that open lines of communication ASAP is crucial because as long as people know whats going on you can get some sympathy and maybe even help (I heard they went through a firing of the team as well as manufacture delay). I'm sure onloop will release a statement soon so hang tight all!

I burned a lot of bridges with friends and family that I am currently repairing. I found that it is easier to tell the truth because rebuilding bridges takes a lot of energy, time, and money. 

The good news is I am learning how to repair bridges! :slight_smile:

I've been awaiting fullfillment for a long time now, but completly apart from that the Focboxes I can wait for.

There's an awful lot of panty-twisting going on in here, partly teenage angst at worrying what is happening to the life savings, but also some have an axe to grind with vendor gripe-trolling, you know who you are!

Real people may have gotten fired for the electrical do-whizzies mishaps, so I hopes everyone is happy. This is not a @Shogu12 fark-over, it is product made in china subject to made-in-china issues - supply/post/warehousing/dragons

In other news if you watch the price on the focbox currently in the USD it has soared in price to 159.80 USD if you bring it up with enertion they say it hasn't gone above 200 AUD in months.  In the past 3 weeks I have seen the price go from the cyber Monday price then back to there normalish price of 151 USD now almost $10 more.  Looking back at the exchange rate history the USD has been higher the the AUD like always about 12/8 being the highest since the cyber Monday sale at 1.33169 and it has dropped to 1.30740 but yet the price of the focbox has gone up since Friday.  

I also just heard from enertion that they will be shipping orders with the free gift on the 20th of December and they said they have already shipped up to order #15303

If you are in the states and need these that badly, go help out @longhairedboy, he has some in stock and ships from Florida. Get one from him and can cancel your @onloop orders https://longhairedboy.com/collections/all/products/focbox-electric-skateboard-motor-controller

Been buying shit online for lots of years. 

187k has passed through my PayPal in the past 11 years. Out of that time there's only been three occurrence where an invalid tracking number was provided. 

I've voiced it multiple times. **Could care less about the time frame of shipping.** When I get a tracking number **I expect it to be valid, or become valid within 24-48 hours of issuance.** It's been 13 days that this tracking number has been invalid. And I still don't have an answer. 

So simmer down? Nah. Don't be deceitful as a business by giving out fake tracking numbers to buy yourself time. Lol keyboard warrior. My points are pretty solid and fall in line with over a decade of online purchasing. So yea, everything I said still stands. Please prove my points and argument wrong... Lol you can't, because most businesses don't give out bullshit tracking numbers...

As well this is the complete opposite experience of previous purchases from enertion. Which have all been valid tracking numbers once the order has been marked "shipped".

So the take away is
-previous orders have had valid tracking numbers from DHL
-this order is not a valid tracking number and is China Post, every other order has been DHL
-enertion support says it's shipped
-it obviously is not shipped
-almost two weeks of being told it's shipped, with still an invalid tracking
- @ShutterShock also had an invalid tracking from China Post and is 40 order numbers behind mine and has a proper DHL tracking now..yet others before him don't.

Should I keep going?

I wonder how these tracking info is produced.

One thing I've seen is that a tracking number is pre-made and sent to individual customers. Actual products are sent from the factory to a destination or county in BULK to what I assume is a distribution center where it's then packed and that label (with your tracking number) is slapped on and picked up by FedEx/UPS, etc.

Not saying this is what Enertion is doing.

@longhairedboy I have no doubt they are highly crafted tracking numbers by American standards.

But if you want true quintessential hand made quality it has to be British. Our tracking numbers are known throughout the world for their quality and classic styling.

As a company man myself (software engineering), Its as simple as a single statement saying, "the system is fucked, we are working on it, things will be late"    and the whole problem dissolves away.  We all trust enertion to buy from them, but we have nothing that is going to make me want to buy from them again if they cant even tell us why my tracking number isnt working.  

@longhairedboy  I trust anything you say because your transparent, and have a presence.  if something goes wrong with your process, you make a post, or at least a statement saying what’s going on and what to expect.
unfortunately enertion has failed to have a presence and explain what is going on, and only recently was able to give tracking to a single customer, but not the rest of us complaining.

Everyone in here that actually bought a focbox was lied to. 

They said they had 500 units to ship immediately. That clearly wasn’t the case. 

They gave me a tracking number that is China post that hasn’t moved in 10+ days. This is a lie.

Then they are claiming the holdup is because of a free moneyclip. Are you kidding me!?! 

In fact this is exactly what this forum needs. A damn uproar. If you’ve been around this forum long enough to see how this place operates there unfortunately is a lot of shady stuff that goes on. Any thing that doesn’t look good on vendors suddenly disappears. People price gouging the hell out of components. Etc etc. 

There is absolutely zero accountability.  And to have a “well that’s just expected” attitude about it is insane. These are supposed to be real businesses. They should operate as such. 

To be completely honest I’m a little shocked this whole thread hasn’t magically disappeared already.

This^^^. There's some good seeds and bad seeds. But out of all of my hobbies. I've never experienced lack of accountability of businesses like I have with esk8. I'd prefer this thread doesn't get closed.

And that enertion respond with a real answer as to why in what or any business model, providing a fake/invalidracking number is acceptable practice. Because quite frankly I wanna see enertion talk thier way out of this...


The main thing here is communication. Fuck ups happen. Delays happen. Plans change. But when you communicate with your customers, things are ok.

I get it you can't answer everyone when big fuck ups happen. An easy solution would have been for enertion to send out an email with an announcement to all of it's customers to address the issue. That hasn't happened. 

I'll give ya an example of time and communication. The photon remote by @Wajdi and Gummies by @trampa. Orders took a while, but you don't see me complaining because the sellers have extremely transparent and open communication

So who is to blame here?

1.) Enertion for lying about having 500 units ready to ship?
2.) Chinese Manufacturer lying to Enertion about having 500 produced?
3.) Chinese distribution center creating tracking labels prior to having a box to ship thus causing an invalid tracking number?

It is obviously an uproar that could've been avoided if they never said they have 500 to ship and did not prematurely provide tracking numbers. @onloop needs to get the the bottom of this, start firing more people and smooth out these issued. It almost seem like Enertion was better run when it was just the three of them operating in his garage.

**Update**
First of all really sorry for the delayed response. 
Jason and team are in China settings things up there and we are in the last phase of the Factory transition. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BcoMM6NHDEc/

I know that most of the customers are very frustrated with these delays and thinking that we have lied to them about the stock. 
Let me clarify that Enertion never lied to anyone and will not lie in future as we love our transparency. We wanted to remain transparent. 
That's the main reason, Our CEO shared live feeds with the insights. 
We've been trying hard to be back on track and to announce every update but there are something we must need to verify before posting anything 

**Some of the tracking id's are showing invalid data or no data**
We've personally emailed them with the updated tracking links and numbers 
But in case, any of you missed it, please follow this 
**For Royal Mail orders** 
Please use this link to track your order 
https://www.trackingmore.com/royal-mail-tracking/cn.html

**For DHL tracking numbers, Please use this link**
US/UK orders: http://webtrack.dhlglobalmail.com/?locale=en-US
German orders: https://www.dhl.de

**For China post/Singapore post orders**
Please use http://www.17track.net/en

For the rest of the unfulfilled orders
Following are the reasons of hold up 
1: Our Factory transition is not yet completed
2: Got some issues with the Manufacturers 
3: Waiting for the delivery of Free gift (Money Clip), 
4: Waiting for the deliveries of Wheels and some other parts.

**Please note: We have FOCBOXes and NANO-X instock available**
We will be resume shipping hopefully tomorrow.
Working with the forwarders to do it as soon as possible.
So Orders having FOCBOXes and NANO-Xes will be shipped soon. 

I hope this will clarify the situation more accurately. 
We've got about 700 orders during sales and still counting.
And we are shipping them gradually.
Soon you all get you tracking details
Due to Xmas, delivery may take longer than usual and we can't do anything about it.

I hope I've addressed each and everything. 

Kind Regards, 
Carl Collins

Same for me, if these wheels linger I'd knock em off and just have the rest of the goodies. Either bung me another focbox or a few nanos instead?

I also ordered 2 Foc boxes and a nano x and live support on Enertions site says -

"Our CEO hired a new team and factory. All shipping has been put on hold due to the transition. We've just received an update that Cyber Monday orders will resume shipping after December 20th.
Shipments are placed on hold so all efforts will be focused on setting up the new factory. Once this is up and running, shipping and production will significantly increase."

I don't understand why we weren't notified sooner or told that our Cyber Monday items have no way of reaching us before Christmas.  The Nano X controller was going to be a present for a friend of mine and now I have to scramble to find something else and spend more money.  SMH...I guess I should've known better...

I don't think the expectation is unrealistic as FOCBoxes are being sold by many vendors.  It seemed like, and was stated that there were plenty available.  People do a lot of Christmas shopping on Black Friday/Cyber Monday.  That is what these days were built on.

I bought those focboxes so I could try my new gearbox with motors cause I don't have any ESC on me to try them, so I thought I will grab them before holidays and will get to use them by right now, but guess then the will be shipped 1-2 weeks later, then I will be already left my parents place...

Transforming logistical problems into a marketing event with teasing is really **marketing genius** (or not).
More seriously @onloop , although I am very indulgent given the very low price of focbox, I have something else to do (at work) than to connect to a livestream to understand what is happening and when I can expect to receive my order (knowing that the support is unable to respond as it shifts the date every week). A serious business begins with an irreproachable logistics, a proactive and transparent communication :) But I take my trouble.

Did you get hit with duty cost?
I'm order #152xx.  Purchased 2 focbox and a nano 5 minutes before official sale started and was shipped 5th December to Germany. 
Finally managed to track it yesterday after Enertion revealing it was sent with Royal mail and not china post.
Last update was "Released from customs: customs cleared, HEATHROW" on the 18th.
The DHL number they have given me still shows no available information.
I am leaving town for Christmas tomorrow night until the new year so little hope it will arrive on time.
. 
Interesting how each added item added an additional 12€ to the shipping cost with no option other than express.  Then if you throw down 200USD for the free shipping they post it out on cheap standard shipping.
If I had known the free shipping was a bait and switch I would have thought twice about buying the extra focbox to reach the $200USD limit.

It is being handled now but it still does not negate the fact that they were ill prepared. Especially when these items could be possible Christmas gifts you want to give the person what they wanted not a box with a piece of paper with a picture of 2 focboxes on it or if you are getting them for customers.  Most people this day and age with Amazon Prime expect items to ship and arrive pretty quick I know I do.  I completely understand this was a unseen problem and it is dealing with international items but when there is a corporate screw up generally there is a compensation.  I know I have had to discount stuff I have been working on because it was late when it was finished.  So even though the focboxes were below the normal amount which has now increased by $10 according to Carl there still should be a compensation for the drastic ill preparedness on there end.  And marking an item shipped when it hasnt is just wrong I understand most of the time it is automatically when you print the label but just dont print the label or you will have what this thread is... alot of unhappy people who feel like they were robbed.

And if everyone got their fair compensation for this minor inconvenience then Enertion would be forced to do something even more drastic and stupid and people would feel like they were being robbed even more.

That's a false sense of entitlement derived from your experiences with the behavior of an unrelated and irrelevant vendor. 

You can't compare Enertion to amazon. You can't compare Amazon to anyone. You can't compare Enertion to anyone. 

the very idea of "everyone performing the exact same level of throughput no matter what is happening" is patently absurd, and potentially insulting to both the vendor for being expected to be superman, and to yourself for believing that you're moronic enough to think that everyone can actually do that without some vast infrastructure in place. You articulate your posts well, you are not a moron. Don't treat yourself like one. Be a responsible consumer and do your research and manage your expectations. You will receive your order. 

Don't be a Gary Pikovsky.

I was not meaning to compare enertion to amazon I just simply said that they were grossly under prepared to expect that the focbox was not going to sell like it did.  I feel like it could have been handled a little better then it was. it seems like everything is starting to come together for them again and hopefully they will learn from this mistake and make sure they have enough to support the community.  I think they will make sure they are better prepared for next year

I think the part everyone is missing here is that it wasn't Enertion that fucked up. It was the people they hired to make their shit. Those are the people that fucked up, those are the people not doing what they agreed to. Did Enertion make some huge mistake by hiring them? I'm pretty sure only Captain Hindsight could figure out what should have been done to a degree higher than the swath of disgruntled expert customers Enertion is having to deal with due to the Chinese once again saying "hey oh yeah we do that for you and here's all the proof you need you can trust us we deliver very good" then not doing it because reasons.

pre-orders, group buys, drop shipping, fab-to-order, and commissions all operate that way. We do a lot of all of that stuff around here, so yeah, the environment is one of "buy now get sometime later." which may not be what was expected in this instance, and probably shouldn't be dragged into this particular clear case of a manufacturer not being able to do what the vendor and customers both expected of them.

My buisness operates in preorders and sometimes things slow down progress but I notify the customer whenever something happens as soon as I know, the reason for this is it let's the customer know that I care about getting them the product and I'm honest and most important is that because of this magical stuff called technology it literally takes a minute to send a message via email, or text so they know. I would have thought enertion had solid manufacturers by now but sometimes things happen, updating people 2 weeks later though is not justified. I would not sell something as in stock though unless I'm holding it in my own hands😉That's my 2 cents😂😂😂 honestly though we just have to deal with it now or request a refund

I agree. The main problem everyone has had would have been simply solved with communication and proper customer support. 
People have been told there items are shipped with China Post but get nothing from tracking number for almost 2 weeks.
I contacted support 2 or 3 times asking when item would be updated and got told a number of different excuses. 
Then it's finally revealed that tracking is with royal mail and has updates since the day it was shipped.
Directly contradicting almost everything support told me. 

A majority of the complaints in this thread would have been solved by knowing that simple fact from the start.

agreed 100%. I get that these are small businesses selling to a niche market, but if you're going to try to give the appearance of operating like a large business then act like it. LHB is one of the smallest vendors on here and the shit i bought from him was at my house within a week. Other vendors take months and months to ship your stuff. I don't mind stuff taking a while, it comes with the territory of shipping less than a hundred units per month, but be honest and transparent instead of lying to your customers.

I think the gist of this thread is. I love enertion stuff but why don't I have mine?

The answer is, Enertion is still growing and some of the pains of growing and being transparent is that when people lie to Enertion they pass the lie onto us. Then the public thinks Enertion is lying when in fact they just are learning who they can trust and who they can't. 

We are along for the ride and I am grateful for the transparency. It makes me feel safe having "invested" 3k in parts and a board. Do I wish Enertion would let us know sooner about shipping delays, YES. But we all have lessons to learn and this one is small in the grand scheme of things.

@scepterr and @longhairedboy you both have great points.  Let's just remember to never punish a company for trying to be transparent when they could just as well tell us nothing.  Personally, I'm happy that at least I am hearing news, unlike other unnamed situations with other unnamed companies.  I mean, I need these in my house TODAY, don't get me wrong.  But make sure not to knock them for being honest.  Knocking them for making unkeepable promises is one thing, but at least don't make it counterproductive for them to keep giving us status updates.  If each status update leads to more skewering of their name, the status updates might slow down or stop

i do whatever the fuck i want. If that means defending a vendor i rely on so that he doesn't get bankrupted by impatient entitled refund mongers then pour me a glass. It wouldn't be the first time i've been accused of being an Enertion fan-boy. Probably won't be the last, in spite of having moved almost entirely out of his supply chain, save the motor controllers. 

there's a bigger picture here, and instead of painting it we're exploring the flaws of capitalist democracy and considering a torch and pitchfork approach. Lets just tie him up in a bag and throw him in the river. If he floats, we'll know he's a witch and we'll burn him alive accordingly. But if he drowns, well, it would have been nice of him to deliver first, oh well.

Ok boys (& girls)...as I told you a few days ago that I was specting the arrival of my steel motor pulleys comming from [Eskating](https://eskating.eu) in Italy, before New Years Eve.... well, it happened. They just arrived today, December the 26th. :sunglasses:

...I ordered the pulleys two weeks after the Cyber Monday, and as I told you before, that the shippment will be here by years end. It was true. Right under schedule..... "Two continents and one ocean apart". 

How many of you are still awaiting for the Focboxes, the Nano-X, and other Enertion goddies from (??) :thinking: :rolling_eyes:

The thing is, I asked not to ship it until Jan 5 as I'm not home...
Well, I hope it'll take some time to arrive so I can pick it up before it goes back to the sender.

The tracking number indicates that it cleared customs in Switzerland... And it was shipped the 16th of Dec ? What the f ?

Had a chat with the support, apparently they sent it now because it'll take time to arrive anyway.
I had to send an email to the support regarding the wrong tracking number though.

Important information: I ordered only one focbox, I paid for the shipping (I believe free shipping is using another, slower, delivery option).

I'm not as annoyed as other people since I'm not home anyway. I feel the pain for Enertion, must be hard to process all the orders with a brand new team. #notSponsored

if i had $100,000 to spend on marketing, i would take orders and then delay them and use the money for refunds. 

It's unbelievable the amount of buzz generated amidst the juxtoposition of heavy targeted marketing and delayed orders.

For those of you worried about tracking numbers: I never received an updated tracking number (had an invalid one), just an email from 12/9 saying it had shipped. I'm in the US.

Quick question: The focbox arrived with 3.5mm bullet female connectors. Why aren't the males included?

Depends on lots of things but I use 10AWG to the battery and 12AWG to the motor, you could probably get away with 12AWG to the battery and 14AWG to the motor.  I can't really see a circumstance where 16AWG wouldn't be too small.  Don't use 16AWG is my suggestion

Yep. You're exactly right. I've been pretty out loud about how much of an Enertion fanboy I've been over the last year. NOT ANYMORE! I've spent around $6,000 on their website over the last 10 months and have waited over and over and over for Enertion products. I've even referred friends and strangers to them. To which I've received some backlash due to their lack of being a stand up company. This time I thought it would be different considering they publicly stated that if we ordered on Cyber Monday our products would be shipped in a week.  

I really don't care for their excuses anymore. I'm still not sure why I would choose such a company that consistently lies to their customers. Sure. Enertion can call it transparency. But that's not what's been happening. It's all marketing their huge fuck ups and then calling it transparency.

People chose them simply because no one can provide a well priced contender to the focbox.
Until this changes they kind of have the monopoly.
I too have spent a lot of money over the last couple of years because there is no other financially viable option.
When someone gets it together to sell something at a comparable price and reliability I'd imagine people will vote with their mouse fingers if the supply chain is reliable.

I've got some pg7 glands on the way which I will be checking into using, can hit the case up with a tap should I go that route, is there enough space for a receiver? How does it mount without tabs...maybe questions solved by another prototype...once again kudos for giving the focbox a home

You guys know that vynil cutters/plotters work for cutting griptape right?
[/quote]

Tried it, didn't work well.  After approximately 20 linier feet of cutting the blade was so dull it would either drag a line or shred the griptape (both sides up attempted). 

I'm doing some fairly intricate designs that require more than 100 linear feet per sheet.  I'm also working on laser engraved deigns for the top of decks.  As well as engraving and cutting many other mediums including but not limited to griptape, decks, wheels, laminate sheets, etc. and some substrates outside of the esk8 world.

I'll be doing.some.free griptape and decks as I get setup.  After that I'll be selling pre-made designs and customer designs. More info coming soon.

I understand your totally pissed off Sean (and everyone else who is waiting)..

[Sean not directly speaking to you here but your comments fired me up]

So Let me get this off my chest..... delays suck, I get it, trust me I have spent the last 3 years waiting on my overdue orders. But guess what... life is really shit sometimes and stuff just doesn't go as planned & crying doesn't help either.

This is a grass roots industry, everything is being built from ground zero. Every esk8 vendor is a startup with basically zero experience. Enertion is a tiny piece of shit and our suppliers don't give a fuck if you are happy or not.... & Shit happens.

So Please, everyone try to get over it... if you can't, simply take a refund and walk away!..... we don't need this drama right now.

[Sadly, this thread is trending hard with "supplier bashing" theme... this negative energy will ultimately push all the best vendors to quit this industry, it's happening now! Goodbye Chaka] 

Yes, enertion will do refunds, however we prefer if you don't because it really hurts our business especially during these tricky situations when everyone (lawyers) are draining us of cash. It also makes it extremely complex for our administration staff and the newly trained order fullfillment team when we keep cancelling things that are awaiting shipment... "don't confuse the new guy"

Incase anyone doesnt know whats going on let me tell you all again.....

We fired our entire china project management team at start of December, they were in charge of parts procurement, warehousing and fullfillment and Raptor 2 productions.

We fired them because they continuously failed to deliver and clearly weren't scaling well with us (yes we are growing rapidly).....  The last straw was after the cyber monday sale ended, at the end of November they didn't have the money clip or the wheels available to ship as promised (wheels which I ordered fucking 5 months ago!!!)


The cyber Monday sale was a huge success, our biggest month on record! Thank you all for the Orders....  I had been planning the event for at least 4 weeks in advance and gave china team plenty of advanced notice. In my mind everything was set to go.

......It's really sickening when I put so much effort into somthing and get let down by others who don't seem to care. Yup life sucks and shit happens.

Everything was due to be instock and ship out by first week of December. Yes the fucking FocBox (over 500) were in stock and ready, they have been in stock for many weeks.... 
_I had worked extremely hard for 2 years, struggling with at least 5 different PCBA suppliers across the globe who couldn't meet demand or quality requirements, to have them in stock and i finally fucking succeed, yippee for me_ 
.....but who cares if you can't actually ship due to legal disputes.

Firing the china team started a dominoes effect of endless shit fights that is still going on now.... It's literally 12 months of hard work developing our supply chain down the drain. It's going to take fucking months and months to rebuild again... yippee for me again.

Meanwhile i should be enjoying Xmas with my 3 & 1 year old children and with my wife.... But instead, I'm in the process of packing up my entire house and everything I own to move 3000km away, over a week and half drive across a country with intermittent internet access, to a new city for my wife's new job. Somehow, each day I still need to be to be holding the hand of our new project team and solving all the problems and fucking legal issues just so we can simply ship our products out to our loyal paying customers...

Seems the entire world is against me right now! I can't even turn to the community I built for support because you all want me drawn & quartered... Thanks guys! Yippee for me again.

For anyone who actually gives a shit about the truth, Let me summarise what happened after ending the contract with the project management team in December.
1. They stopped communicating with us and suppliers.
2. All pending orders got ghosted. Money clip & wheels etc.
3. The freight forwarding company got blocked / no comms. 
4. Legally we were blocked from using own wheel molds / or taking delivery of parts made in molds.
5. All Undelivered parts got blocked.
6. I was forced to pay over $100k upfront to try and get our stock.
7. After counting stock we realise we didn't have everything. More complications...
8. Weeks of negotiation and bullshit to try and get orders sent.... 

This matter of transfering to a new team and the fullfillment of hundreds of orders is mostly rectified now but still hours and hours of work to do. 

Yes the wheels are still at least a few weeks away. Pending legal ownership transfer.... (Just remember I ordered them 5 months ago..I'm fucking sick of waiting..)

It took me 12 months to setup this team in china, it will probably take another 12 months to rebuild a new supply chain.. But this action was needed for Enertion to grow and to achieve our goals.. 

Guess what, Crying won't help me solve these problems, I'm just going to keep doing what I have always done.. fighting hard to build a sustainable business and keep developing the best products on the esk8 market..

So, Just 4 weeks delay and our shipments are now moving again?..... Considering what has happened this is a fucking miracle... Yippee for me again.

Also, don't forget, If you folks cannot wait for uber cheap FOCBOX, support your local certified FOCBOX supplier and send them your order instead....

Just remember, Enertion has delivered 100% of our orders, sometimes later than expected. But we always deliver!!

P.s. If this community wants to keep trashing vendors who are working their guts out there will be no vendors left.

This is not a marketing message.

Merry fucking Xmas and happy new year.

@onloop

I get everything you're saying. But it seems to me like after all the Raptor 1 business, selling parts, ect... you would have learned the whoas of business. Everything you stated is nothing new and upcoming businesses actually plan ahead for these kind of things so that when they happen, their customers for the most part don't even notice. You're acting like you're brand new or something. That's what's eating me away right now. You know these things! You already learned these things! You stated that yourself in the many videos that I followed. That's why I thought that this whole R2 venture along with the wheel selection deal was in the bag for you guys. I get it. You're a small business. So why continue on like a never ending KickStarter??? 

I have my R2. I fucking love it! I got it 8 months late. I don't care about that at all. That's a great time for a kickstarter!!! You killed it on that. You also make great products! It's not why I'm upset. Here is the real reason why I'm upset. There was only one part in the few parts that I ordered on Cyber Monday that I was going to use on my daughters 1st eboard by x-mas considering she's begged me to make her one since helping me build my 1st. I actually promised it to her. With your companies statement of "shipping within a week," I thought that ordering a product a month ahead would be just fine considering what your company stated. Would you disagree? Now that I'm upset I've only gotten the "we're a small company", and "this is how is goes", and "this is their fault" excuses. It's not manufacturers fault. It's your fault. You should have known to expect these types of things. These types of things that are happening to you have been happening to everyone in business way before you were even born. That's why in business we usually pay people to account for these types things before we use customers money. But with the days of crowd funding you guys seems to take others money without a care in the world. 

P.S- You did a few things right in my opinion over the last year. You made the Raptor 2. And you hired 3 of the best guys to have on your team. @Blasto, @barajabali, and @JohnnyMeduse. As far as I can tell, they are the only guys on your team that know what they are talking about and will do something about anything. I will never talk to your customer service again considering the lack of help that they are. I'll stick to these 3 guys. If it weren't for me just all around liking you as a person @onloop, I would say this company sucks. But I really don't think the company sucks. I think your companies strategy sucks!

I had a little bit of complaining earlier. I will admit it because there were orders that took several weeks to be shipped when today’s people are expecting items to be shipped out a few days after the order. I have been waiting because I know they are the best and the price was great. However with the delay it was a little irritating but it was mainly because we were not given any reason why besides the money clip. If you had come out and said hey guys this is the shit I have been dealing with like you just did I think this thread wouldn’t have gotten out of control and basically become a witch hunt.

Thank you for being real and open with the type of stuff you have been dealing with. That is really all I ever was looking for is a real answer and not kind of corporate answer.

Sean, things were mostly going well until they weren't...

This is a very difficult industry. Many before us have gone broke and failed in the process. People have lost their houses over this fucking industry.

Just remember, We have been shipping FOCBOX globally for month's from "in-stock" and people were getting them in just a few days... We also had secured enough stock to start suppling to Resellers (on credit so they can try to build up some cash flow and grow). That situation took at least 3 years to setup. Things don't just happened magically overnight. Blood, sweat and tears. 

Yes, I agree we have some very experienced team members onboard and that is something I'm very proud of, because its my goal to be the market leader, without a solid team we can't succeed.... But they cannot magically transfer their years of knowledge to our support team. They also can't predict the future...

Unlike any other vendor, We also have 24/7 customer support incase people have questions anytime of the day all over the globe... Do they know exactly when you will get your wheel's? NO, believe it or not all shipping timeframes are estimates.... Nobody can predict the future. Are the customer support team expert esk8 builder's? NO they are not.... Do they know about the legal issues of mold ownership transfer? NO they don't.... Do they try their best to answer the thousands of various questions about everything esk8? YES... Are they perfect NO.. Is anyone?... 

This team has taken over 12 months of work to setup, they are improving every day. This all takes time. 


As usual, things were going well until they weren't.... Like when you crash your esk8 and break your bones... Why don't you plan to avoid that? People have been breaking bones for ever, so why does it still happen? Because shit happens.


Yes it is possible to have contingency plans in place. But it takes time and money. Setting up a contingency plan to replace our project management team would take approximately the same amount of time as it does to get the primary team operational in the first place. If we spent all our time setting up contingency plans it would take us twice as long (6 years) to get to were we are now. It would be the year 2020. Imagine if I said your raptor 2 was going to be 2 years away (mellow)

Infact the only true way to have contingency is run dual operations in parallel. Very complex & expensive for a small operation.

Dude, I understand your hurting about Xmas. I'm sorry im not running the business of your dreams... 

I promise i'll try harder.

I plan to break bones when I esk8. Why wouldn't I? That's why I have insurance and a bank account. Same strategy I use for when I drive cars. I also had my 1st will done up. I'm not a dummy. Anyone that rides a blank of wood at 30mph and up should. 

You're now treating me like I've seen you treat others when they question, get angry, ect... ie., "I'm sorry im not running the business of your dreams..." That is a very back-handed statement. I don't want a dream company. I also never asked for one. I want a company that does what they say they are going to do. Why would it be our fault for expecting to see what you guys state come to fruition? 

You haven't even bothered to answer any others posts until I decide to get pissed off on the internet (which I NEVER do!) and state facts. Why??? We've been here with our money in YOUR WALLET!!! If it were the other way around I'm sure you'd feel the same. Am I wrong?

P.S- Just stating a fact here. But if you focused more on doing what you say you're going to do (and having the employees to make that happen) you could have more customers like me that spend a significant portion of their yearly earnings on your company. Shit! Just get 10 dumb, ignorant pieces of shit like me and you'd have yourself $60,000 a year easy!!! Just think about that dude.

P.P.S- Fuck this shit!!! I'm going to ride my R2 to blow off some steam!!!

Sean, not sure how many businesses you have been involved in. But literally 90% of the time is spent solving problems. If you go into business expecting everything to be perfect or thinking you won't make mistakes and not being prepared to solve problems, failure would be very rapid. It is impossible not to have problems, sometimes it seems people are asking us to be faultless?....  

Warning to all: If you expect Perfection or instant gratification you need to Shop elsewhere... Because we can't promise those things.

I'd argue that if you never make any mistakes you will never make any progress... It's all part of enertion becoming a mature company. Maturity & experience in business is counted in decades. Not weeks or months.

**If anyone has questions you would like me to answer fire away!** 


All I can do is keep working to solve problems and with the balance of my time I'll focus on innovation. 

Maybe one day  I'll have all the answers, I'm truly sorry your not happy man. 

You will just need to wait until we are better.

Look, arguing and complaining about this isn't helping. I know it sucks, i'm waiting on orders myself, but you need to understand that Enertion are doing everything they can at 200% effort to make us all happy.  The best way to help @onloop and yourself is to just sit tight, more stress will only create more problems which will just slow things down. 

Honestly, I'm pretty upset too. But at the end of the day, you just have to consider the best course of action with the best outcome, which is to just patiently sit tight.

All the money is spent, the suppliers have it already.

_Designed them 8 months ago._

I've been personally involved in three actual companies that still run today. Those businesses also ship when they say they are going to. I order twice a month from 2 out of the 3 still to this day. 

When was perfection mentioned at all? Please quote me. 

So... When you said that our orders will ship in a week, what did you actually mean then? Did you mean that we should all recognize a new business and expect delays? Did you mean that we should all know the history of esk8 purchasing prior to buying? Because that is the polar opposite of what you guys were marketing all over the place. You guys marketed In "Stock Products" that will ship in a week. Now we're finding out that they aren't in stock. I'm not sure how I was supposed to expect your company to have delays and that you're a "new" business. Wouldn't you market in that fashion if that were that case because you're company is so transparent?

I'm not sorry that I'm unhappy. I'm sorry that I trusted what you said to us, the public. And then after the fact, you decide to use back-handed replies and sarcasm. I'm not sure how to explain this to those that I urged to order from you considering the fact that sometimes you sound like a total dickhead when you respond. If you didn't reply with such a  dickhead response, I would probably just say that the company ran into issues.

Just so you know. I'm not mad at YOU Jason. I'm mad at the people YOU chose to do business with. In the end it's YOUR choice. I want your company to get bigger, richer, and keep creating. But I also don't want those that find it to sit in the back hearing a CEO get sarcastic towards them when they get angry because you said something and didn't pull through. 

To be honest. I have 16 people (friends & FAMILY!!!) that I referred to buy R2's from you. They purchased. I didn't use the code to get referral money because 1.) I don't want money coming out of a small business's pocket (I've blatantly supported, posted about your company, and referred everyone I could to purchase from you guys.  2.) I work for my money. Refer to #1 . I'm partly responsible for their money being held on to. I'm sure with all the money taken in you can understand that. And when an unknowing customers buy something they don't expect month after month long wait times with excuses to follow.   

I get asked every other day why these delays are happening. Normal buyers don't care about your business. Normal buyers don't know about esk8. Especially your deceiving %110 refund if you're not happy! That means we will still lose out on %10 just to get refunded our money for supporting your company. That's fucking crazy!!! This is why I'm speaking out now.

@onloop   -  hang in there.  I feel for you,  im coming under some of the same problems here in the UK as I am trying to set up my own buisness ( been waiting 5 months for the R&D team to build one machine that I designed that they quoted 50 days to build and test. ha ).    Luckily im in the position that im doing everything behind closed doors as my company isnt in the public yet.

I know I bashed you (only a little) in the past for the delays. but I do stand by it,  just a little more communication and everyone would have been on your side and understanding ( thats if you could, I know legal stuff can get pretty messy)

and finally,  your producs are amazing,  so I would like to say thank you for working so hard over christmas to sort things out.    I would end it on "keep working hard" but youve already done loads, so ill end on, "here is to you not working too hard in the future"

Especially your deceiving %110 refund if you're not happy! That means we will still lose out on %10 just to get refunded our money for supporting your company. That's fucking crazy!!! This is why I'm speaking out now.
[/quote]

We are not deceiving anyone man. Why would you say that? 110% refund is if you are not satisfied by the performance.

Read the terms and conditions if you are not sure about how things work.

Also, We have a 20% cancellation fee for very good reasons, it helps us to avoid insolvency...   everyone loses if that happens. This is not related in anyway to the performance promise.

If people want to support us they can pre-order early and get a big discount on a product that is being developed. We are sacrificing a huge portion of profit just to get this product to market. Without support it doesn't exist.

All my friends and family want a raptor 2 also. But they are not ready, it sucks

Once again, I'm really sorry I can't make production go faster.

I know it's going to be OK. What's not OK is having a company hold $24,320.32 + shipping (multiple purchases) in eboards and not give a proper answer. I really don't know how to tell everyone that the owner of the company is giving sarcastic responses and having his staff regurgitate the same non helpful response over and over. 

You can look back at my history over the last year on this forum and see that I've done nothing but support Enertion to the fullest. I know this company. I respect this company. But I also expect more from this company after watching it get to where it is today. I'm only working with what Enertion has posted here, facebook, or youtube. If I'm missing something let me know please.

They can look me in the eye and decide for themselves wether they want to trust me or not. If they pull their cash out it will hurt but I can't stop them...

My Aunt that purchased wants to marry you because of your voice (she loves aussies). She ordered two R2's for both my cousins. So that wouldn't very fare ;). Probably same goes for most of the Mom's that I convinced this was the board to have. It's not that dude. It's that after looking back and seeing the history, this is nothing new with Enertion. I've been able to order from other ESK8 companies no problem. Those ESK8 companies are WAY smaller than you. That's crazy to me!!! 

I haven't lost faith yet. This is why I'm speaking out now. I want you to know how I feel. I'm all for sending you positive vibes dude. I've been posting daily about enertion, screaming enertion at these guys on the forum, instagram, facebook, doing group rides, ect... After all these setbacks, delays, and weird posts I kinda feel like a piece of shit for doing so. These guys here on the forum are the real deal dude. They know what they're talking about. You know that. Please get your business where you say it is when you're marketing. Otherwise guys like me just look like fanboy dickheads.

That's what I thought. But with the sale dates it didn't seem so bad after following the company for so long. That's why I'm speaking out now. I've been a customer for over a year and thought that things were finally figured out due to what has been posted/said publicy. I literally reffered just off what Enertion said. So yeah. Probably my fault. But still... is it? 

My 1st purchase...

As a father to another father, I know you do dude. I don't doubt that at all. I wish you the best in this venture of yours. I've been where you are. I failed myself. Lost everything. Got it back in a way. Now I'm here telling you what someone told me. Don't tell customers something that "could" happen. Tell them what WILL happen. Rule of thumb here is, under promise and then over achieve. :slight_smile: 

I'm not posting to create havoc in the forums or be one of the "complainers". I've never actually done something like this before. I just feel like there's a lot that's not being said here. Hopefully that makes sense. 

I'm posting because your company said what it said and then I as well as others put our money where our mouth is with nothing to show for it so to speak. ;)

My turn 😃

@onloop The last thing I think anybody here wants is for you or Enertion to fail, people love the product but hate the broken promises particularly when they didn't need to be made. 
This is one VERY understanding community and specially versed in the history of Enertion. 
When you said you have 500 focbox stocked and orders will ship within 7 days, had that team ever shipped that amount of focbox atleast in 7 days? If the answer is no, no matter how much they promise,swear, whatever to you it's not a promise you should make to others. 
If you said before the sale, guys my goal is to get everything shipped within a week because that's what I was promised would happen BUT the reality is things could easily take a month to ship and there's no way for me to guarantee either way. Maybe you'de get 5-10% less sales but everybody who did order would be HAPPY or at least have their expectations met. 

All the frustration is really with the communication before and after and not the delay itself IMO.

I agree. The only reason I found this website/culture is because of Jason. He single handedly forced me into eboarding. My lifestyle has changed, my money spending has changed, and my priorities have changed. 

Priorities before eboarding:
1.) Family
2.) Work

Priorities after eboarding:
1.) Family
2.) Eboarding daily
3.) Where to get eboard parts?
3.) Do I have enough $$$ for eboard parts?
4.)  Doesn't matter. I'm buying this shit.... lol

I fucking love this! ESK8 has helped me to trust strangers on the internet! It has gotten me out of my boring home on days when there is nothing to do. It has put me through my first surgery. It has brought me closer to my family. Thanks to @Blasto I built my daughter's first esk8. She loves esk8'ing now!  Not only can I have fun, but I can spend more time with my best friend!!!

Oh that. Yeah i thought about doing that too. Retail is shit, and custom builds are hard. But just building whatever completes i want in a factory looks like a grand idea. Or, you know, whatever completes Jerry wants. 

But then i get orders like the last two, where one guy wants a neon pot leaf and the other wants a finish like a guitar. Its hard to say no to some things. And if i'm going to get components by the dozens anyway... why not to retail...  its hard to cage yourself in.

I think your confused. You don’t have HW6.0 none of the focbox have that ‘installed’. Hardware (hw) version is the actual board and components on it. Firmware (fw) is the code that actually makes the motor spin.

I found out why the Vesc tool said its was Hw 6.0 -  since I was a beta backer I use the updated (blue version) tool.   apparently no matter what that version will seem to always output hw 60 instad of the correct one,  plus it doesnt support other vescs other than the 6 - downloaded the free version instead, works first time and recognises the correct hw version, even though both have been updated since release.

You could use the money clip as a lanyard clip for your remote, attached to the board. Or attach the clip under the deck and use it as a phase wire guide between motors and VESC.

I assume that's what you meant when you asked if anyone had any ideas? :confused: :laughing:

Actually, if anyone ends up with a money clip that you don't want, let me know! I'll put em to good use somehow.

Maybe they're sending the wheels later and just getting the in stock items shipped first? Seems like they should mention that though, if that's what they're doing.

That would be even worse considering it would be the opposite of what they said they were going to do... again... Otherwise we would've all had those 500 "in stock" FOCBoxes that we ordered a week after Cyber Monday if I understand the situation correctly. ;)

How do you know what FOCBOX HW version you have? I'm assuming it's written on the PCB, as shown here.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/2X/d/df0713c87c938286ab8112cf0e37bf82ad63c568_1_375x500.jpg

Are they all v4.12, even the older VESC-X? Are there any differences between components with the same v4.12 HW?

They are all 4.12 based but there are different vescx/focbox hw versions. There are some components upgraded, mainly for reliability and robustness

Welcome to ESK8 dude. Or at least what Enertion calls growing pains? Or small company problems? Or distribution problems? Or manufacturer errors? Or employee problems? Or our problems for giving them our hard earned money when we were told an exact date for shipping when we paid up front and didn't get that even a month after expected? It's probably a fluke is what I'm betting on. ;)

the main problem is this lack of transparency.

This is Enertions version of "transparency". They fuck up, leave us in the dark for a while, we get mad, then they tell us the same thing over and over, and then we still don't have what we paid for. It's pretty cool...

My order #155xx still awaiting fulfillment. The don't have the foxboxes in stock, this is what they told me on chat.

"Our sincerest apologies that we have not been able to fulfil your order in good time. Although our previous fulfilment team assured us that they had sufficient stock to fulfil outstanding nano-x/FOCBOX orders placed during the end of November, this has turned out to not be the case."

(02:06:10 AM) Carl: Enrico, Actually we got some issues with the current batch of FOCBOX, So we send them for QC again.
(02:06:54 AM) Carl: Now we ave already ordered 2000 pcs from our manufacturer in December and waiting for delivery
(02:07:27 AM) Carl: We will be getting them in the upcoming week and then we will be resuming shipping

Looks like they're having some QC issues. Honestly, this is understandable considering all the shit they've been going through with their new manufacturer. I was told my order #15344 will be shipped mid-end of jan. 

Attacking these guys won't do much but stress them out. They're already trying their best and there's nothing more they can do. The whole thing sucks but to be honest, shit always happens. Just try to not make that shit into an even bigger problem.

**Here my advice to anyone waiting.**
1. Wait for your order to ship (yes we will always ship your orders out immediately & as soon as it is physically possible)
2. If you cannot wait, Ask for a refund support@enertionboards.com

agreed,  as much as its all well and good to bash a late product.  its not good to keep on bashing untill its creamier than my nans mash potato.

also, does anyone know which focboxes have been found with a QC problem,  would be good to know which number batches so people can check if everything is in order on their orders when they arrive.
