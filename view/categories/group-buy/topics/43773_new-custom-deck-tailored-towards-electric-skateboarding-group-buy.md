Hey guys! I'm going back and forth with a deck manufacturer to produce a new downhill styled deck for electric skateboards. General specs are:

* 38" long
* 9.5" wide
* 5" curved Kicktail
* Integrated tail handle for dragging the board.
* Tub/Flatcave concave (makes for easy mounting of the electronics)
* 8-ply maple layup
*  Multiple bolt holes for looks (and adjustability)


The deck's general shape is going to look something like this.

And this
![41B03BC8-25E2-43FC-88E9-729F76FC65E5-3572-000004CEE256FBAB|225x225](upload://wqQWvZLCGwxcdAJPcrxovhHYXUK.jpeg)![D7DB75EB-2D10-42FA-9A72-10C42B3B8722-3572-000004CEEE2FB187|333x500](upload://vTYqVsD7gSKrcJ4LJnIEfpAbFBb.jpeg)

Of course the main changes will be a kicktail with a handle and a wider flat area to flush fit with enclosures.

I'm looking to fund the startup costs and initial production with a group buy, so I'm projecting a group buy price of 35-40$ or so. Hopefully I can get some pictures soon of the final product. Any thoughts or suggestions? I'd like a tally of interest so then I know how to proceed.

Downhill deck with a 6" kicktail?  I'd like to know more about your design concept. I think we would at least want to see some sketches as to what you are thinking the final product would look like.

* Do you have a 3d concept render to share?
* Deck profile/cross section?
* Wheelbase? 
* Likely flex characteristics?
```

## \#4 Posted by: PredatorBoards Posted at: 2018-01-15T09:42:36.160Z Reads: 604

```
* Oops, made a typo. kicktail is 5"
* Wheelbase is roughly 27"
* We are looking at minimal flex due to the consistent tub concave of the deck

I just began the design process, but I'm pretty set on what I want as for the design of the deck. I don't have a drawn cross section of the deck, but as said earlier it's a consistent tub concave. The flat portion of that cross-section is 7.5", which should be wide enough for whatever enclosure you intend on using.

Did some double checking this morning with a measuring tape. The Psychotiller 405 enclosure should work for this deck. That means this deck will accommodate a 10S4P enclosure without a hitch.

Are you saying the enclosure would fit the deck even if you have belt driven motors mounted under the deck? Or would it only fit with rear mounted belt motors or hub motors?

I have been trying decks from skateshred to test different deck features for electrics..These are perfect for hobbyists wanting to try different deck styles and shapes on electric setups. The quality is "good enough" for testing and I haven't broke one yet..

You're right about the belt drive motors making it a tight fit if we were to use the 405 enclosure. I'm debating increasing the length to 38 inches to things easier to mount, however I'm debating the change in size, and whether or not we're better off using a shorter enclosure that still fits the 10S4P pack and the VESCs.

Aight so here's an update. The cost to produce each deck is $30 give or take, not including shipping... which is sure to be a bitching since the MOQ is 50 units. I'm going to set the group buy price at $40 per deck plus domestic shipping. 50 decks is a lot though, dunno if there's enough people interested.

CAD model surfacing is not my forte, so ya'll are going to to have to wait for the pictures of the actual prototype. Hopefully there's enough generated interest. If anyone is interested in helping me CAD model the design of the deck, that would be appreciated.

Another member is helping me render the deck, so we'll see how that goes. However if you want to render your own version of a badass looking esk8 deck (sticks to the guidelines of 38" long, 9.5-10" wide, 7.5" wide flat spot, flatcave concave, **kicktail**), I'd be interested in seeing what you come up with! The community can compare from there and decide what it wants.

Well the people have spoken. 9-ply back breaker it is!

Onto the actual design of the deck, @GrecoMan and I are still trying to finalize the shape of the deck, but then I realized that the Banshee I currently sell + the bolt on kicktail looks pretty close to what I'm envisioning.

Of course the actual deck will be wood, the 'flatzone' is narrower, and the concave will be more pronounced... but this is pretty close to what I'm shooting for. Thoughts?

I think there's a giant skateboard industry that makes a crap ton of awesome decks and they have been in business for ages, we should help keep them in business and buy their sick decks instead of making new ones..Muirskate has a deck for anyone..why are we not trying them all and talking about them? I've been burning through the lower cost ones like skateshred for a while to test them with power, I have yet to discover what "the perfect electric skateboard deck" looks like, but there sure is thousands of options to try...I mean, they have done all this homework already right? test them...they come in 6, 7, 8, 9 plys..any shape, flex or not, kicks or not...why not give them credit for making rad decks and find the best one?

I think there's a fine line between making a cheaper version of something that's already out there, and trying to innovate. I'll still continue to save and buy me them Bustin and Loaded decks, however I don't think it's unreasonable for this community to create a new deck designed specifically for esk8. What I hope for from this project is to create a product that inspires other long standing companies to create decks more tailored towards esk8ing.

Have you given them a chance? Email them about it? CNC routing on decks is a pretty popular thing these days too, I bet they would love an excuse to use them for more than just cutting wheel wells. It's just an idea..I actually contacted a deck builder, why reinvent the wheel? Just tell them what you want in the deck. I'll ask around..

Alright boys. Here's some good news. I'm chatting with @Alphamail's friend from DRANG Longboards. Looks like ya'll are going to get to live your dream of seeing an ESK8 deck with 'sophisticated' concave and a flat routed bottom to fit your choice of electronics.

I'm personally leaning towards a deck cutout like this.

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/a0/ef/e7a0ef709b364e700c682e3f20d84af5.jpg 

Of course the concave is going to be overhauled to lock you in when while you're going at 35mph+....

I think I'm pretty locked in for this deck shape. A friend of mine actually owns one, and while I agree the concave isn't the greatest, the deck shape gives so much foot platform that I'm sold on that alone. The concave will be changed, so whatever gripes I have with it will be dealt with.
```

---
## \#56 Posted by: PredatorBoards Posted at: 2018-01-25T23:13:46.012Z Reads: 296

The reason for the 'drag' handle is because adding a handle to the side will make the deck look uneven. Adding 2 handles will make it far too wide. I'd have to source Raptor 2 styled handles which adds to the labor and costs.

Even more happy (but slightly irrelevant) news for ya'll. I'm going to be fielding some Labeda 90mm wheels with the plush formula for my company. We'll likely sell these as an upgrade item. I'm grabbing at least 8 sets for testing and sending out for review with the Banshee.

How's $40 per set sound?

This is for the fans of Nelson Longboards. I'm chatting with the owner, and I think I just might get to survive their legacy if he chooses to give me the designs. When that happens you sure bet I'll take what I can learn from concave profiles of their boards and apply it to this new board I'm working on. Don't worry about the original decks by Nelson, I got plans for them....

If you want to do this in a timely fashion, I would suggest concentrating on Drang who is still in business for a reason.  Jared at Drang has the equipment to do virtually anything you desire for a good price.  My son and I spent spent a day with them August of last year exploring opportunities for 2018 and they a lot of those are now realities!

wowow big accusations :slight_smile: The Tessaract family isnn't one of the most conntiniously sold deck series for nothing :slight_smile: . I love my truncated tessaract. Concave in all the right places, supports aggressive free ride as well as downhill, has wheelbase options and allows for big wheels with the flares. 

Don't get me wrong, the Batray (I prefered the Stingray DH that's why I owned it) is a wicked deck. But never forget, a deck is something very personal. Every rider has an own preference, style, stance, foot size etc.

So I don't think it is fair to say that the Batray murders the Tessaract :slight_smile:  

I get your hype about the potential collaboration, you just took literally one of the most sold and appreciated decks ever in your comparison:wink:

I've owned the Tesseract and a shortly a Batray. For some reason it was easier to bang out slides on the Batray than the Tesseract. I think ultimately I'm just biased towards more extreme concave...

I get your point however. The Tesseract is still a very respectable deck that is plenty fine for all types of riding. However I still think the Batray has more 'thought' put into the design. It is after all a deck that has seen several iterations and improvements since its release.

*Disclaimer" Not meant in any way confrontational or anything. Feel th need to put this disclaimer in since people seemed to have forgotten what a discussion /exchange of opinions is :) All in good faith and meant friendly (people took it the wrong way lately :( )

While that could very well be, since again every concave had its benefits differently for other people.
The bat ray is a true free rider, even for more technical stuff. With the double kick tails and the shape not really race oriented. (race oriented deck usually keep their width until the truck bolts to maximize leverage in turns. The nose is also tappered towards a comfy tuck position and limiting your footprint around you to allow to run in packs or trains). Also there are super over-engineered decks, with all the thought put in and they still suck. They might be super pretty and loaded with specs but not really usable :) 

The big difference would be the construction, the mounts and the batray being symmetrical. 

- ( batray) 8 play maple is super solid, but warps can happen, chips and chunks. Water will eventually get in, and the wood will work its course. That's why most decks we prefer currently are no longer pure maple, to bring more options to the table and ensure longevity.

- (tessaract) The 2 fiberglass and 2 bamboo layers sandwiched in makes it super durable and a smothe ride on the tessaract. Makes it also surprisingly light. The cork feels wicked and it extremely durable.

- ( batray) Flushmounts are flushmounts. awesome.
- (tessaract) tessaract sports 3.5 degree wedging angle changing the behavior of it somewhat and allowing some interesting hardware options. 

- (batray) the symmetrical concave is comfy, the W concave is mellow and comfy for long rides. Yet felt a little on the smaller side for toeside maneuvers. 

- (tesssaract) the rocker feels similar to the batray, the W definitely more aggressive. Actually in my opinion one of the best W concaves I every stood on. aggressive in the front and back for all kinds of shenanigans while milding out in the midle for comfort and allowing foot placement.  For me the flares in the back with the rocker in front, give me the perfect length and pockets for a comfy tuck to really lay into to. 


They are 2 very different boards, with different goals they were meant to achieve. 

I can go on a skatetrip for weeks and just bring my tessaract. Can freeride, join downhill runs and sing up and try to qualify for races all with one deck. And that thing just doesn't die, it lives forever lol. 

I am not putting one above the other, just stating more clearly that they are very different. (truncated tessaract/batray) 

TLDR:" mayby just say you freaking love the batray and are sicked about the deck". There is no need to try to put it above a titan in the industry. There is never a need to compare or put above other decks. If it is awesome it is awesome on its own :slight_smile: 

PS: If they do a Batray SK with a bamboo fiberglass core, I will gladly throw my money at them (and so will others) :slight_smile:

Lol yeah I've been playing with that idea with a bamboo fiberglass core Batray. Though I'd like it to be more stiff than the Tesseract if that's the case. I appreciate the discussion, since any one sided conversation is boring and doesn't add too much to the discussion. Also, you bet your ass I loved them flushmounts for the Batray. I will stay to the point that I'm primarily objective about my opinion of certain designs, and I just felt more comfortable on the Batray than I ever have on the Tesseract. However that's still just me and my limited knowledge/experience though :wink:

They are wicked. Super friendly and amazing customer service. Friend cracked a deck. No questions asked, he got a new one. Just check if you really want such a wide deck or you go for the thinner option. But yeah feels great and Swiss boards, what's not to love :slight_smile:  

Do it, you wont regret it. Just make sure about the width like I said. I got flowed for feet so it suited me :)

Aight, looks like this deal with Nelson is definitely going through! Officially, both Drang and I will have licensed rights to Nelson's designs. I checked with Drang, and they're fully equipped to do triax bamboo hybrid Batrays! I'll probably begin looking into doing large scale production for these triax Batrays in the future, however in the meantime, you can directly ask Drang to do a one-off custom triax Batray. :) happy sliding

Heh, funny you brought this up now. I just finished finalizing some production changes to the Banshee. With that out of the way, I'm shifting my focus back to the Batray esk8 deck. Hopefully we'all have some CAD mockup to showcase what's going to be made.

I'm really leaning towards something like this:
![IMG_4141|480x500](upload://rD1uZwnKZHfYQucSPXMGf832Udi.PNG)

Obviously there will be a generously sized kicktail, to boot, but I'm really liking the snubnosed design. It gives that really spunky look which departs from the traditional rounded off nose of most esk8 decks.

I'll likely be shipping these decks to my home and then individually shipping them out. This will keep the costs down for the group buy. When I turn this into a commercial operation, I'll arrange for an actual logistics company to handle shipping. I'd have to check and see how long production will take, but I can't imagine taking any more than a week to ship out these decks once they arrive at my place.

Well basically what happened was that I was communicating with some suppliers to create a new esk8 deck. Some time down the road, I acquired access to Nelson's Longboard's designs. So now I'm arranging for an esk8 deck that is derived from Nelson' Batray.

Around this same time, I became acquainted with a flexible American manufacturer to handle production. I'm unsure about the group buy pricing as of now, so I can't comment on that now without going back on my word later.

Y'all are going to like this bit though: There will be **4-5 different Batray-derived deck cutouts/shapes**. We should be able to cater to almost everyone's preferences, be it a double kicktail, single kicktail, chopped deck, classic shape, etc.

We can start as soon as another 2 weeks, assuming we finalize the designs soon.

@michichopf looks like the Composite Batray will become a reality. For now I want to keep this group buy exclusive to members here on this forum. However I'll definitely be reaching out to the rest of the longboarding community after this group buy is completed. By any chance do you have a social circle of people who'd be interested in getting the word out when this happens?

Double stacked is doable and probably preferred. The whole point of a routed out battery tray is that you can use a thinner enclosure for double stacked setups.

I’m working with a fellow from these forums (can’t remember handle) for the last number of months. Specifically we’ve built him the same non cnc built hand made deck three separate times now and he’s been building carbon fiber enclosures and turning them into badass e board builds. This next built will have a cnc cut bottom relief of somewhere between .125 and .18” deep at max. Much less angle to the concave but micro drops and a single kick than Nelson designs. Much more to my liking.  Any concave can have any shape even the Nelson boards. I can route any enclosure on the bottom of any cnc build deck with ease.
