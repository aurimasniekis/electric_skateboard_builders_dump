I`d be interested in a group buy - been scouting around and most of the vendors are overseas and price are killed by shipping costs and import fees.

My findings so far:
http://www.ebay.de/itm/361336146169?_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649&var=630676593690&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

Scouting around alibaba most of the vendors ask for 50sets or 500-1000 wheels as minimum quantity.

I`d be in for a group buy for soft duro and > 83mm 

@ajaynagra
what`s your plan/idea for a group buy in general?

I would take 2 x 97mm if that is possible. Where do they produce the blank wheels and which company exactly.

Maybe we can ask them to send directly to each person but do the order in one go. Because that means for them less office work. They only have to pack a couple of parcels with what they are maybe ok. And shipping from China can be very cheap. And we might get a huge number of forum people to order and lower the price by that. And if the price is then below 25 euro it would also be tax free. (in Germany)

[/quote]

They generally dont do that because its not in their interest to distribute small quantities of orders individually. I will being doing the office work as i would need to ship the wheels out myself. This shipment will not be cheap by any means 20 wheels costs 60 Dollars to ship and so did the controllers last time

 What about this:

- describe which wheels could be in the group buy (size + durometer) and if you know the estimated cost
- let`s create a document where people can note what they would order + where they live for calculating shipping costs

If we find enough people and you are willing to do the office work (organization, shipping) we can have a group buy?

If you are not to keen on all the other work, I can offer myself with helping here - yet I live in Germany - don`t know if shipping costs to/from germany are cheaper than the uk

I am personally interested in 90mm soft duro (75/78 ?) wheels. Also would be interested in a pair of 83 (and/or 97) wheels for comparison

Another idea I had:
If we find enough people per country - you could just post one shipment from the uk to that country and then the people arrange for other shipments themselve? - less work for you, but I am not sure if this increases the overall price by a significant amount

On a side note:
I was thinking of doing a larger buy and just simply reselling them via ebay - but I don`t have the money to spare for the moment

Ok @mrpj the idea of getting some shipped in certain parts of Europe would not be a good because of shipping costs.

Shipping costs 150$ for 20 sets of 90mm and 97mm i think it would cost too much to split shipping

@ajaynagra Update the original post with your closest price estimate for each set of wheels, i.e 83mm at 75A : $/£x

I'd like to know and i'm sure others would benefit :stuck_out_tongue:

@ajaynagra

man you will make me poor - love that you organize also the other parts for a group buy.
Just wondering, are the prices mentioned by you - the end price, or do we have to calculate for extra cost for import duties and taxes (i.e. when it is send to you?) 

And I agree on the shipping part - I was just thinking out loud - do it the way you see it fits best. If there is anything you need assistance with let me know (I hope I can help then ;-) )

I hope you don`t think I am stupid - but in the form it states QTY Wheels - do you mean QTY of sets or wheels? 
So if I want in total 8 Wheels, should that be 2 or 8 in that field?

They are the end price there they might up or down a little bit if i charge with customs which really isnt a lot if i sell around 30 items so dont worry.

If you want 8 wheels select 2
