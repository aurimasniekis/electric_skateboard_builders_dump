If we order 300 cells we can get them for 3.3$ each, is there any interest in this?

Seller is from alibaba and seems legit, shipping from me to you shouldn't be much 2kg package, 15$ flat i think and that is 40cells, still waiting for a shipping price from them to me

About 23$, in package
11$ in a bag, kinda expensive
40 cells at nkon with shipping would be 170 or 210$ euro to croatia, probably cheaper for you just to order from them since its a local shipment
And this way, 40*3.3+23=155$, still a cheaper way

Do you not get whacked with import duties and VAT when you receive shipments like these to HR?
I'm certainly interested in participating.

He better be legit tho. If someone fucks you over on alibaba I think there is little that can be done. Tbh I'd rather order from a seller that has been tested by forum members before...

Why don't you just buy cells from ru.nkon.nl If you write to them I'm sure they'll sell them to you since they ship them from Germany anyways.

They said that they usually put a low package value so no import charges

ru.nkon is explicitly for non EU only.

If you can work it out i would definitely be down for this to happen. Just looking at them at nkon.

Do your research, most of Alibaba batteries are... fake.

To be honest, I haven't tested and verified any Alibaba cells by myself. Shipping batteries to me is very expensive so I didn't want to take the risk and pay so much for fake cells. However, when I searched for Samsung 18650 cells and tried Alibaba as a source to buy from, a lot of suppliers contacted me and offered really attempting quotes.

I searched online and couldn't find any legit recommendations of buying batteries cells from Alibaba. 
In my research I found out that most of the sellers in Alibaba manufacture 18650 cells by them self. 
You need to make judgments and ask yourself if it's possible that all of these factories are making 
GENUINE Samsung cells? Yeah, I don't think so...

Do you really think they have any relation to Samsung? The only thing they have in common is the Samsung warping over the battery. In addition, Samsung 30Q are priced for around $3.00 in Alibaba. Nkon.nl & Gearbest.com (which are reliable & cheapest sources to buy from) sells them for around $5.00. 
To me, it's suspicious. 

If you have the money and the willing to get into it, good luck, maybe you will find legit cells.

Gearbest has quite a few negative reviews about this

I haven't seen any negative review about their cells. 
However, their customer support and shipping time is very bad.

So, I work in the IT industry in AU and one of the larger vendors that makes power banks etc offered to sell me some 30Q batteries at $2 AUD each but ended up not being able to help me out because of export laws :frowning: He said manufacturing is very cheap but the costs of getting stand alone cells out of China are incredibly expensive and often very hard. He mentioned something about a UPS package exploding on a plane some years ago.... In short you could get the cells cheap. But may not be able to get them out of china.

I just got a shipping quote frome one of them and its 240$ for 300 cells wich is really ruining the price

What would one require from Alibaba seller to proof the quality and originality of their cells? I am currently talking with a nice lady which wants to offer me the best deal possible but i need, as i said, the proof.

Only way is getting samples but you could still get ripped off when you buy the larger amount.

30Q are at 3.35€ each on Nkon if you buy over 200. Is it worth taking the risk for such a small difference?

For now the interest isnt very big, shipping is expensive and the more reputable sellers have a huge moq, in my oppinion the group buy is off

I bought all cells from nkon so far... hard to beat the price and the shipping time.
So i´ll stick to that, if there isn´t a huge pricegap

The price for 100 cells is 3.2$. 
Waiting on the price for 400 cells with 231$ shipping to Germany. It should be under 3$. 
I also think that nkon is the best option but my curiosity is taking the better of me :sweat_smile:.
