Hello e-skaters, my name is Luis, based in southern California. I have purchased 51 focbox (vesc-x) in bulk. Enertion support say 2-4 weeks for delivery from purchase date July 13, but cannot guarantee this. I would like to offer the community a discounted price for Focbox.

All 51/51 spots filled

This pricing includes paypal goods and services fee, shipping in US, shipping insurance, shipping supplies, and international fee. I have over a hundred transactions through this site selling various items so I know the work involved and I'm equipped to handle shipping quickly upon arrival of Focboxes. US only. Comment below or PM me if you have any questions.

We will have to see how much interest there is, then I would need to collect payments to place order once we meet necessary amount for 51 units. I can purchase at least 11 units, maybe more, so we're 20% there

I can probably start collecting payments once I see there is enough interest. Then we need to raise enough for the 51 bulk discount. I can purchase a bunch so might not take long. Then it depends how long it takes enertion to send focbox out. Then once I receive focboxes I can send out wirh priority mail asap, two day delivery usually

Showing 50/50 interest, if someone like @mmaner would agree to reship it to my adress in Europe (i hope you dont get flooded with requests now lol) 

Though my final choice would also depend on whenever I have the needed money for the purchase available at the time of the order.. as I suspect it might take at least a few days to collect all the money before it is finalized, right?

I agree, I think it should have been made at the beginning already.. lol..

Perhaps people can also put a state / city close to their name or something, so at least a few filters are made, and probably the quantity of units, too!

--

As there might be a bit of interest from eu, maybe someone can take up a responsibility to later service these from europe by reshipping the controllers to Eu countries.

Okay, need to confirm but here's how I think it's going to happen. I will purchase all 51 units because it takes paypal a while to transfer the funds to my bank account. So then I can just open payment method to my PayPal account maybe tomorrow. Payment will be as goods and services so I can buy and print shipping label directly from PayPal in priority mail box/envelope. Enertion support says 1-2weeks and I can ship with in the week of arrival to me.

I can probably do EU, no promises. Need to figure shipping because I don't know if printing online is as simple because of customs. Shipping will be at least $15-20 more and I cannot change declared value do to shipping insurance, so VAT apply. Also can't really provide service if I were to ship to different country. So it's more hassle, I'll think about it.
```

---
## \#41 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2017-07-10T22:18:38.252Z Reads: 225

Well I think the best course of action is that you skip the Eu part for now and leave it to others, for them to decide is it worth it to reship some of the controllers to Eu.

The Vat part might suck hard for a few countries, when most custom offices might not know what you are getting there anyways + I think not everyone is going to resell it for a profit or something anyways and will use it personally for themselves.. 

On a side note.. you might as well get so much interest, that maybe all of the units u order gonna be taken out anyways by US customers.. will see :)

ATTENTION Everyone

I have updated the first post. Enertion from my understanding does not accept PayPal. This complicated things a little because the funds I have to purchase 51 units are mostly in my PayPal account. Transferring funds from PayPal to my bank can take 3-5 business days to complete or even longer. So I wanted to make sure I have a back up if they didn't get there by the weekend. I have a backup now setup and will for sure be purchasing Focboxes on Sunday July 16. Enertion support says 1-2weeks delivery after  purchase. So i am now accepting payments for Focbox purchases. Details are in first post.

This a good price but how does warranty work? It's my understanding that Enertion only warranties the original owner hence why I'm buying Focboxes for my second hand raptor dual and not having then replaced under warranty. Imo I ordered mine from @JohnnyMeduse it's a bit more money but he has them in stock now and he offers warranty on them himself.

I have accounted for at least two units from the whole order to be warrantied upon 30 days of arrival. Focbox is pretty robust. Most of the issues are user error so can only warranty if design flaw. Wrong settings and Canbus is one the easiest ways to mess up vesc-x/focbox so suggest everyone read up on that.

No, I mean make sure you know how to setup canbus correctly. Make sure all the settings are correct and you must connect battery to both focbox at the same time via antispark. Some users like longhairedboy even suggest soldering connector to make sure Canbus doesn't become loose.

Ahhh, I understand now.  I was a little concerned that you meant the FocBox didn't support can bus, and that would suck as its the only method of getting telemetry from dual VESC's that I know of.

I wish I could jump in on this as the price is amazing, not much more than a Chinese 4.12 vesc with no heatsink! My esk8 budget is already used up and I need a new deck. I think you could do these FOCbox group buys every 3 to 6 months and they would fill up quick. Thanks for this service to the community. :heart_eyes:

Wondering if you all could help me out. 

 I will be building my first eboard on a 95 comp mountainboard from MBS. Planning on dual motor 190-270 kv and haven't researched battery options yet. Using to ride in cinder filled, cracked  and pot holed streets, maybe some off road (dirt road). I weigh 220 lbs (100kg). Probably maxing out at 20 mph. 

Will these VESC be a good choice to use on this type of board?

Shipping to EU complicates things because of extra shipping cost, declared value, vat taxes. Would be simpler if someone started a group buy for EU specifically

With group buy for Eu, you mean someone like you - who will order the batch of all Foxboxes and then individually distribute / send them further out, right?

Otherwise I dont a see reason for you to work through one more person in Eu, I think.. unless that person does everything independently and on his own

Good news I have placed order for 51 focbox units

Not so good news is I talked to enertion rep and he says focbox are in stock, but there is a processing time of 7-14days separately from shipping time of 7-14days. So the wait time estimated is 2-4weeks. There are only 16/51 focbox units available.

Really? I thought these were supposed to be one of the best Vescs out there. My TB vescs came with 5.5mm bullet connectors and an xt90 plug. That's honestly kind of disappointing. Is it necessary to swap the xt60 for the xt90 if I already have a space cell 3 with an xt60 ready to go?

Having connectors or not doesn't have anything to do with its quality. It's a product for hobbyists so you'll have to do something basic soldering with it. I agree that it would've been nice if it came with connectors, but it's not much effort to throw them on.

I want to see how this one goes. We don't really know how long it's going to take for Focbox to be delivered. If enertion doesn't deliver in the timeline they mentioned then it makes things more difficult to setup. Also Focbox were more expensive then I originally thought because I got hit with international fee.

Great news I just received the Focbox and will try to get most shipped Friday and the rest Monday. A couple of people didn't leave address so look out for a email asking for address.

There has been a change of design and seems the are now being made in China. They have a black aluminum bottom case and the upper looks to be redesigned to sit flush against it. Now comes with the receiver cable which is a big plus. Comes with 14awg phase leads and the bullet connectors are small. The connectors are same size as the xt60 connectors not sure if it's 3.5mm or 4mm.

Just got mine in, thanks again! 

I wonder if anyone has made Enertion aware that they are coming with 3.5mm instead of 4mm. Im sure it is just a mixup with their manufacturer.

I think the raptor 2 hubs may be using 3.5mm's

Got mine and soldered on some 4mm bullets. The ones that come with it look extremely small to me. I was using 5.5mm bullets before. 

Also the phase wires are way smaller than the 12 guage wires on the phase leads that were on my previous enertion vesc. 14 guage just looks tiny especially compared to the 10 guage wire I used for all other parts of my build.

So even with this new batch the sensor stickers are still wrong... Just a warning everyone, make sure you plug in your sensors correctly, the sticker is wrong. 

It should be from left to right with the phase wires pointing up... GND, H3, H2, H1, TEMP, 5v

Mine was sent to the forwarding service for route to Europe. They received the package (very fast shipping by Titoxd10001) and then seem to misplace it in the warehouse :frowning: FFS, I really have the worst luck. Hope they find it soon...

Appreciate it man! Enertion doesn't have bulk order pricing anymore. But this cyber Monday price seem like a very great deal. 

@thisguyhere has been killing it with the GB's lately. Picked up some stuff from him
