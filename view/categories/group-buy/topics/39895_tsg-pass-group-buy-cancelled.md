**Current Count: 8 - Still Open** 

Howdie!

So after helping some people grab these helmets when they were on sale, and having mine lost in the post I've looked for one but they're all too expensive. 

Contacted a UK distributor and they've sent me back their stock list. Please look at the table below and let me know what you're interested in acquiring. I'll then be able to report back and see what price we can get them for. I'm happy to ship anywhere provided you're willing to pay. 

As with last time, I'm not looking to make any money on this (just want to help this awesome community where I can). I know there is already another EU group buy but I want to open this up to anyone. The distributor only has the solid red helmet on their site so I've linked other sites for pictures of each colour only. The helmets should come with a reflective and clear visor each.

@Mikenopolis and @calnick0 I've not yet been given a price, and don't want to put a guesstimate out there. Here is what will happen: 

1) Gauge interest and let them know. 
2) They give me a price. 
3) I report back and see who is still in. 

I'm using this weekend and Monday as the window for people tell me what they'd like and then hopefully will get a price on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Its not ideal but I just want to give this a shot and see if we can all save enough to make it worthwhile.

Cool, Thanks for reaching out and helping the community. I'm looking at a few online in the low $200 range right now

The prices on these things definitely make it a hard purchase. Do I get two 6374's or one helmet? hard choice.

She will never understand. Get the dang $200 bucket, wait for spring 'till the melting snows, then you get the 74.

Just a tip to anyone buying these. 
Iâ€™ve had a few xl and the non carbon ones are slightly easier to get on my head. The carbon one is super snug where the regular is just snug!
