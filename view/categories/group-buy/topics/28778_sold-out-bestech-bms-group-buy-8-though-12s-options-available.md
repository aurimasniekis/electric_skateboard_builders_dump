back story, skip below here if not interested:

------------------

i got a 12s bms from bestech through @korryh's group buy.

pretty sure i burnt it out during installation as i shorted the exposed battery's positive bullet connection onto the heatsink of the bms while the negative connection was made to it.  the short created an explosive spark and melted a portion of the heatsink.

for sure the bms discharge isn't working because it toggles between battery voltage (47v, let's say) and then dips to 4.9v.

also the charging isn't working, it's stuck at 45v.

basically it's fucked.

------------------

so i need a new bms, and i'd like to stick to bestech.

you can find spec sheets here:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bestech-10s-bms-usa/22803/73

the upper and lower voltage cutoffs can be adjusted.  in the above group buy it was set to 4.1v upper, 2.9v lower:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bestech-10s-bms-usa/22803/63

minimum purchase is 2, so if someone could jump on this with me.  if i get no interest by end of the day i'm just going to order 2 x 12s, and 3 x 10s.

need to get this quickly since i'm charging with a wonky bms.

9s - 38.50
10s - 39.00
12s - 40.00

these prices will vary depending on quantity ordered but should give you an idea.

When I emailed Lucy a few weeks ago she claimed I had to buy 2+ of EACH type (2x10s and 2x8s). :frowning:

I just ordered some from Supower. But considering if I also need some Bestech (6s, 8s, and 10s) for backup.

@Sapphirinia let's talk about this here

i'm getting some extras for myself but we'd probably get better rates for volume.

what are you looking for?  10s?

U have to get a bms specific to your battery config.

got a quote back, it'll be basically $55 per bms, rounded up slightly.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/af82bfdbd07928e928e9a6c43f357da1fd276fbf.png" width="165" height="181">

for liion, upper voltage cutoff will be 4.1v, lower 2.9v.  if you're not happy with these values, i'm afraid you'll have to start your own order, i don't really want to complicate this with a bunch of different models.

to that end, @Sapphirinia, do you still want me to inquire about a 8s bms for lipos?  lipo cutoff should be a lot higher, like 3.2v, but you can control that through vesc.  should be ok with 4.1v upper limit though.

I had 12s actually, but I killed one of my batteries. I wound up getting 2 with more AH. I'm running a Penny Nickel anyway. It pretty much shot out from under my feet. Other people fell off it trying to start. I got used to it but it was still pretty powerful.

Bms is rated at 80amp continuous discharge. 

Also been told burst to 250amp discharge. 

I'm planning to use bms for discharge since u get benefit of balance discharge as well, and some degree of protection from over current. Hopefully it won't bottleneck current tho.

Hi there guys...what would be the advantage of buying one of these BMS's rather than one sold from SuPower? 

For instance this one:

http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-60a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-270.html

I haven't done my BMS research and since this group buy is ending very soon i might as well be a noob and ask! Thanks...

## \#53 Posted by: thisguyhere Posted at: 2017-07-31T18:00:25.420Z Reads: 76

```
for one, the units we're getting in this purchase has the upper and lower voltage limits adjusted to 4.1v to 2.9v.

i believe the supower units are 4.2v to 2.9v.

for sake of cell logenvity i prefer not to go all the way to 4.2v.

another, and this is anecdotal, the bestech units are just way beefier and seem better quality.

bestech are also a bit cheaper if purchased at quantity, and it's also got an eswitch, which i don't use but is an option if you didn't want to mess around with a loop key or antispark switch.

nope, doesn't work that way.

bms upper cutoff will be set for a 12s is 50.4v, which is too high for a 10s.

balance leads will keep voltages across the parallel packs consistent, but the over charge limit is specific for total voltage.

99% sure it does not. 

it balances on discharge but these bms are meant for bypass.
