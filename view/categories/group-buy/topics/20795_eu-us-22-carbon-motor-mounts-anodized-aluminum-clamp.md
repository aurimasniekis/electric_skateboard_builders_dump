These are caliber only.
I modified @fedestanco design centered some holes and added material where I thought necessary. Left original right modified.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/7075d12384c191c871eec36b5828821eb7fafab5.jpg" width="690" height="477">
Here are the two parts that are being made: 5mm 3k twill carbon and 7075 12mm hard anodized aluminum.

@Maxid
The universal mounts will need to wait as I have no 3d files or measurements for the inserts for any trucks other than gullwing sidewinders.

What about the idea to make the Carbon plate a little longer (roughly 1cm) and add holes for a belt Tensioner. They can be made like slots so that you can adjust the position. Would make the motor mount even better.
```

## \#12 Posted by: Shogu12 Posted at: 2017-04-11T13:37:00.941Z Reads: 733

```
@rwxr  The outer wall will not have much to handle as the friction of the carbon being pushed down on the aluminum is what makes this hold.. hard to explain in english for me but basically the force you tighten the screw with times the surface touching. But there is no way the screw will tear out or damage the aluminum without the carbon part being destroyed from what ever impact caused that much force.

Update I made somemore modifications to ensure the screws fit with no hassle. I increased hole sizes from 5mm and 6mm to 5.1 and 6.1.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b85d000c8eefcaef82638cc3211fbf06c3d96cd.png" width="561" height="436">
Also theses will not be lasercut but cnc milled to 0.1mm exact I reduced the material on the clamping surface to ensure clamping then checked in Inventor to make sure they fit.

I just thought about something like this. this mount is 1 cm longer and adds the space for slots so that idlers (tensioners) can be mounted.

And the clamb should be round at the side that faces the ground. Otherwise it will make you fall when you hit something with it.

There isn't much metal between the 5.10 mm holes and the edge of the bracket, looks like 2 mm if drawing is to scale...maybe you should add some more material or move the holes inwards a bit...also @Ackmaniac has a point about the bottom part being rounded to avoid sudden skater flyoffs.

Since these mounts  are already modified to have more material around those holes than the last ones im confident these are fine. The math checks out anyhow unless you hit a wall at 30 mph with the mount they'll be fine. The design is final as for the belt tensioner it doesnt seem like a common  enough request to justify buying alot of those. These mounts come cnc machined and anodized  for the same price as the last laser cut and raw ones because I am ordering 100 for myself and adding everyone  else to my order and passing on the savings so I am going to go with the current design. If anyone wants something  else I'll happly make something new and send them the files so they can order after I am done making these  switches. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/8/d8ee335ec969b8b2b0445ffe8417f2ffd3cf862c.jpg" width="666" height="500">😋

This is a detailed design where with slots for a idler. It is 18 mm longer and you could use 16mm diameter needle bearings. In the picture you see how the Belt would look like for the shortest position with the most defensive Idler position for a 15 / 36 drive ratio. Just as a idea. Maybe more would like to have these plates.

You can also see that at the most defense position the idler is in line with the plate if you want to mount the idler at the bottom.

Hey if enough people want this I'll order some next time. My concern is that the longer  mount would reduce places to fit it and the longer belt would actually  make the idler necessary, so far I havent needed an idler.

Hi! 
Would you sell those belt covers too? Like add them to orders if people need them. How much it will be for that cover?

I assume I could but since  I have to make each one they wont be cheap. If another 8 dollars doesn't  bother  you I'll  sell them but know if these hit something hard they will crack.

@Jammeslu it was already explained in a before post. The covers can be made and shipped individually  though. And also modified for other mounts. I can send you the files.
 [quote="rwxr, post:1, topic:20795"]
Order will be placed on the 27th of April. You will receive a pm with paypal info. Money for parts is due at order shipping when I receive the order from the manufacturer.After order it will be 30 days before I get the parts and then 6 days for USA and about 14 days for Europe.

Here's the form for orders:https://goo.gl/forms/Xcn4doRnXiqb1aDl1

hey @Shogu12, will you be getting extras?  in case there's stragglers or new comers that may stumble on this group buy in the future?

if these mounts are good i think it may become the go-to mounts, especially for the price.  i bet you can sell them at a slight markup to make it worth your while, too.

I am ordering atleast 100 for myself and will be selling and using them for my builds here. They will be available for 30$ for the mount and 38$ Mount and cover keeping the stl files  for the cover open source so you can print it if capabilities are there. Furthermore I am currently  looking intto having a form commissioned to have these extruded which would drastically  reduce the price for over 1000.

it is, but it´s superb in strenght.
The heat part can be neglected, because our 63er motors are able to run with more power, than our escs can deliver. So the heat problem occurs more on the esc side.

Everyone who ordered before today is in for 22$ I have placed the orders and my bank is processing the transfers. If you wish to still part take you can fill out the form but the mounts will cost you 30$ as you are now dipping into my stock. I thank everyone for their participation  and hope for a smooth  process down the road. I will update as things ship, arrive  and ship to you / get to germany and ship to everyone  in the EU. 
Cheers.
Next thing I will be ordering are  Carbon Fiber Decks @ 200$ a piece with room for 12s7p batteries and 4 vescs.
Also 12s5p Batteries: 
Cell: Samsung 25RM (2500mAh 8C)
Configuration: 12S5P
Voltage: 44.4V
Capacity: 12.5Ah
Peak discharge current: 100A .)
Dimensions: 25 x 140 x 650 mm
@ 400$ piece.
If this group  buy turns out successful and everyone  is happy I'll consider  decks and batteries otherwise you'll be able to buy them outright  for  250$ and 430$.

The carbon parts are done I am just waiting on the aluminum parts that should be ready in 20 days. I guess there is some labor holiday  until the 1st of may that delayed the the shipping for the aluminum to start making the parts.

I have 70 sets left without screws( they only shipped enough for 230 but that a different issue).... but I can discount them and tell you the website where to purchase the screws. About 1-2$ for a set probably better if you want more than 4 sets... at a decent price. I will be in the US for 7 more day's and would prefer not to ship the mounts back to korea where I live and had a friend ship them to me from. So if you're looking for deal hit me up.

Okay with all do respect I realize I was dragged away and now this is taking longer than anyone anticipated.
But I had had everything shipped to where I am at my expense and have been working on these for the last days. If I ask for your address it means that even though I have been through 600+ emails, 100s of dm's, have downloaded my paypal history and could not find it. So if I ask for it just give it to me and dont tell me to check again!

Not sure a mistake or generosity but got a third mount but ordered two. Thank you? Let me know if u want me to send one back. 

Also the hardware is not properly sized but nothing a quick visit to a hardware store can't fix. 

A long wait but worth it. I prefer these over enertions. Now let's see how they hold up to abuse.

Got my mounts *yesterday*  (repost from other thread).

Quality looks pretty good.  CF seems nice and thick/beefy.

My only gripe is the hardware supplied is not correct.  @Shogu12 maybe you can help me understand what is going on here:

[img]https://goo.gl/PhWZVq[/img]

The carriage head bolts are too small and rotate freely (kinda defeats the purpose):
[img]https://goo.gl/Ygn1p8[/img]

I can run to the hardware store and grab some that are correct and snug - while i'm at it i'll get nylock nuts.

For the price i shouldn't complain, but the hardware seems sub-par even for only 2$.

I'd have liked to seen one long stainless bolt (bottom bolt), and one shorter stainless bolt (top bolt), or even threading into the bottom of mount to avoid the necessary nut (also not nylock - so use loctite folks).
[img]https://goo.gl/4DS8YA[/img]


I'm glad to have them and all easily fixed issues if you have spare hardware kicking about.  I have just about everything except the carriage bolts that will fit properly into the CF (otherwise it spins and you cannot tighten - defeats the purpose!).

I'm taking over the mounts from @Shogu12, transaction is complete.

I will be sourcing the correct hardware so if you'd like to wait a little bit, I will have them available.

Probably $3 shipped in the US for complete hardware set.

yes, but not for another week or so.

@thisguyhere Way to commit! Any idea what your pricing will be for full mounts with hardware and shipping in the US? 

Also, will you be selling hardware sets separately for those of us that already purchased mounts? That would be super cool if you did. :sunglasses:

Thanks for hardware update. I missed that post. I'll be in for a handful of sets when you get them. 

Honestly, I'm really not sure what a "fair" price would be at this point for the whole mount. They started out at $22 each, or $25 shipped, but that was preorder price and waiting like 3 months, then with missing or wrong hardware in the end. But now that you're taking over and they will have correct hardware, will be in stock, and from the looks of the ones I've got, are pretty solid looking ex-Enertion style mounts, I don't think $35 shipped is unreasonable.

Received mine too. Just to let everyone know there is enough material to run a 1/4" drill bit through the mount and use 1/4-20 carriage bolts. These are easily found at local hardware stores. I think the holes in the mounts are made for 6mm carriage bolts.

You can translate the sizes as follows...

**1/4-20 x 1 = M8-20-25mm or 6mm-20-25mm**

Are you going to replace the hardware we received that isn't usable and the missing parts?  

At this point, this is not a good group buy.  We all waited 4 months and didn't get usable hardware, and at least I didn't get the extra CF plates that I ordered.  I'm debating on whether to file a PayPal complaint.  I figured Id give it a day or so to see if I hear back from @Shogu12.

You can't suggest a belt length unless you also tell folks the gears used!

Going up even one tooth on either can make this not fit.

Better to note the CtC (Center to Center) distance for this mount, and then have folks go to [bbman belt length calculator](https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/) to get a calculated belt length estimate (has been pretty accurate for me).  Now if you are using an idler gear or something - all bets are off and you just need to have a few alternate belt lengths to find the one that fits.

Just want to make sure people don't blindly order belts they cannot use since they don't have the same gearing setup!

Anyways, I opened a PayPal claim.  This is probably gonna be my last group buy for awhile, can seem to get in on one that doesn't bring a shit ton of problems with it.

If you PM what you want Ill order them from manufacturing and then send them to you.  I work for the largest fastener manufacturer in the US plus about 10 other countries :).  That doesn't mean they always have what I want, but I can usually get it off the shelf, from the retail store or from another branch within a day or 2.

the set of hardware i ordered should be delivered today but going forward i'll definitely let you know.

sorry, the transactions that shogu12 completed are his alone, i'm not privy to any of it.  but if you haven't paid for anything, i doubt a set was reserved.  if you did pay, you'll have to clarify with shogu.

as for shipping to EU, it may be ok because it's small envelope so should be relatively inexpensive, guessing $10-12 USD.

@Shogu12 I bought 2 motor mounts and an anti spark switch from you. Switch was paid for on May 11th 2017 and the 2 motor mounts were paid for on May 16th 2017. I have not received anything I have paid for yet. I get that you were away for work and that you're swamped after coming home but you made a commitment when you took my money. Please follow through with your end of it. I waited patiently while you were gone but I can't keep it up without a status update now that you're home. I sent you a PM recently. Could you respond to it and let me know when my purchases are going to be sent?

@thisguyhere I can't believe he sold those to you before making sure he met his obligations to those that have paid already. I bought several things from him and I have nothing to show for it. I'm not making it you're problem so don't take this the wrong way. I just had to say that it's crappy that he'd do that while he's leaving people that haven't gotten what they paid for in the dark.

let's chalk up the lack of communication to his military obligations and give him time to respond.

if there are orders indeed unfulfilled, i have no problems making up the slack from my stock.  but that would only happen with funds from shogu to make up for the missing parts.

I'm frustrated but not unreasonable. I wouldn't ask for you to take a loss. I don't hold you responsible or hold any resentments towards you. You didn't take my money for the GB or sell me anything. I can't see anyone blaming you for the way this has turned out so far. I hope it didn't come across as anything other than me telling you my opinion on the situation since you were the buyer. I can only go off of the information available and I'd say my opinion is pretty fair at this point.


Edit 8/16/17: Since @Shogu12 has been MIA on delivering some of our parts, money, and responses despite stopping by the forum to catch up on other more important things than his financial obligations to members I contacted @thisguyhere . If anyone else still needs these here's the pricing taken from his post. @thisguyhere said it's  "$34 for the complete set, with $3 shipping within the US, $10 Canada, $13 rest of the world. Also selling complete hardware set for $5 shipped within the US". It's not $22 but it's still a good deal. Since it includes the right sized hardware most of us would be spending close to that sourcing our own. 

Thisguyhere bought the mounts off @Shogu12 when he offered the rest of the mounts he had as a single lot. Thisguyhere had no part in the sales or money collection in the previous group buy and he bought these off Shogu12 before anyone knew Shogu12 didn't ship all the mounts to those that had previously paid for them. All that is on Shogu12 alone.

You're probably right. Using this calculator

center distance 60mm gives belt size of 255mm
center distance 70mm gives belt size of 275mm
perfect midway would be 265mm, the belts that were recommended to me by @Jammeslu

I am all for giving people some space to work, but there was a commitment made.  If the seller doesn't see this a high priority any longer, frankly TOUGH SHIT!.  The seller said he would supply the parts, 4 months later he got through this as fast as possible without giving a damn about whether he sent what was actually ordered.

This is going to be my last group buy for awhile, I've never come out of one being totally pleased and most end up leaving me pissed off.

Yes, I feel the same, I was in the EU Ajaynagra GB end of 2016 and it was a nightmare. Finally got everything after 6 months, but it seems hard to improvise yourself as a tradesman/commercial manger/head of logistics/financial director in the same time, especially when you have other demanding obligations elsewhere.
I would recommend any GB organizer not to put too much stress on themselves by committing on challenging delivery dates.

@Shogu12 Your forum profile shows you were online and reading this forum just 13 hours ago. Not cool at all. I double checked and my address is clearly included with my PayPal payment. I also sent you an email with it and recently a PM on this forum with it. There's also a PM from me with questions. With the information available I feel ripped off and I'm absolutely frustrated by the way you're handling this. I waited patiently with respect for your job. You're home now and I'd like what I paid you for. If there was a reason they didn't ship or a problem along the way you have all the information you need to contact me in at least 3 different places. It may not be fair but with my respect for people in our military comes an expectation for a higher level of conduct. With all I have to go by I'm left thinking you're just blowing me off along with the other members who haven't received their motor mounts.




@...Everyone 

I've been participating in group buys online for a while. I'm thinking it's been a good 8 years since my first. Everything from electronics to car parts. This forum is by far the most tame and understanding I've ever seen. I've seen people get chewed out for not responding to messages for as little as a few days. I think it's awesome that those running group buys are given that kind of understanding and trust here. However, I'm frustrated by how 2 of my most recent group buys on this forum have been handled. This thread is probably where I've been the most openly vocal about my frustration so this message is not directed solely at Shogu12. I don't think I'm asking for anything special or unreasonable when it comes to group buys. Just some very basic common courtesy and I'm good. The simplest of responses and a brief statement saying they're going to make good is all I ask when there's a delay or issue. I get they're doing it for free and I appreciate that. I just want to not have to wonder for weeks or months at a time if I'm being ripped off. 2 weeks of no communication and no responses while the organizer has been online is not ok. In my opinion if you take someones money for a group buy they should check in every 1-2 weeks for an update even if it's just to say everything is on schedule. When the unexpected happens more needs to be done to let people know they're working on it and haven't blown it off. Saying packages have been shipped then disappearing for weeks is not ok. Saying everyone's stuff will be here in a few days than disappearing for a month is not ok either.  Neither is a week. If you want people to be understanding with you as the seller you need to be understanding of those you're selling to. Some basic respect and a little thought about how most would want to be treated in similar situations and it should be all good. There will always be exceptions but is what I'm saying unreasonable or too much?

I'm thinking @Shogu12 is caught up in relocation and doesn't have anything anymore probably apart from money/postal receipts. I paid the 'own stock' higher price for mounts so not a huge favour?

I have not received my two mounts yet and due to my own late night mistake I overpaid by $12 or so(paid in euros instead of dollars), sure it looks a little funny offloading the rest of the mounts & disappearing but I'm guessing Jayme will jump back into this thread to resolve the issues sometime soon.

Not concerned about bolt hardware, it's easily got and cheap but I would like my mounts and the extra bucks.

It is annoying when a GB organiser signs into the forum and doesn't post/reply when things need to be sorted out...why do people do that?

Heads up because I had these same mounts from @fedestanco, the carriage bolt heads (the spherish side were scrapping against my wheel pulley. I did file it down from the installation day, but after about 3 months, the wheel pulley started rubbing against the middle carriage bolt. Putting another washer on the truck axle solved the problem but not after scratching the paint and little metal.

If I'm not mistaken, pretty much all the mounts that were shipped were shipped on a single day, and were received early August.

So timing of receipt for the ones who got them, would be another useful data point.

Ben,
I did not see too much insults on this thread considering the total lack of information. Considering it takes about two minutes to post something on the forum that will touch all the persons concerned in the same time, the excuse of "not enough time" is hard to receive. I think not to receive any response is actually worse than the delay itself.

Fair comment. It seems to be a common theme currently with the group buys that people get in deep and then just switch off when the pressure is on. A little update goes a long way to placating the baying mob.
The mounts are really nicely made but with inadequate hardware. Although to have sourced something like this in the UK at the price we paid I'm in a forgiving mood. I hope this works out well for everyone in the end.

To be honest, I don't reall care all to much about his feelings. He's been acting like a real a-hole with not answering PMs or forum posts calling for updates. It is under no circumstances acceptable to do what he has done, no matter how much "pressure"  one has. If he can post pictures of him going out on Facebook he can certainly take out five minutes out of his oh so busy day to give an update, at least that he's working through the backlog. People have paid their hard earned money expecting a product, instead most people have gotten nothing till now. The fact that he's shipping now makes it no better at all and posts appologising his behavior are a joke.

I am having a lot of trouble installing the mount in a way that my motor doesn't end up hitting the deck.

I really like how tight this thing clamps on to the trucks but It offers way less flexibilty for the angle
(please ignore the terrible motor orientation with those wires)

Any tips? Is my only option to get thicker risers? I just don't see how to get the mount to angle any straighter.

You can't see it at this angle but the back of the motor scrapes the middle of the board.

sorry, are you saying the remaining quantities I outright purchased from shogu is stolen property?

I only did that to make these mounts, that I really wanted also, to be readily available since shogu's fulfillment left a lot to be desired. 

I had to talk him into selling them to me. 

like I've said before, if I'm in possession of others that have already been paid for, yes we will have to remediate that. but how to reconcile these discrepancies, I don't know aside from hearing from the horse's mouth (shogu). for sure I'm not giving the mounts that I paid for away for nothing.

I don't think that's the case from what I understand @thisguyhere bought SOME mounts from  shogu, and since then everyone has received their orders from him. The mounts he's selling I would doubt are the ones shogu was supposed to sell you, until he says this is the case please don't make these allegations to one of the few honest sellers. In regards to what @Shogu12 sold you guys I have no idea since some random people are getting orders and he hasn't been commenting, I would say don't expect him to have sent them at this point and if u want to point a finger point it at the guy u bought em from.(which I completely agree is fucked up) but again nothing that @thisguyhere can do since he bought them fair and square

What I'm saying is that me and a lot of other people pre-paid for a product that wasn't delivered and was then re-sold to you.  

If I went to a small engine shop and pre-paid for a set if lawn mower blades, then that shop sold them to you without refunding my purchase price the that shop has, in a legal sense, committed theft because it's my property as I paid for it.  The you, as the recipient, having purchased the lawn mower blades are in receipt of stolen goods.

I'm not suggesting you are responsible for making up the orders that weren't fulfilled, hence my comment above. I'm saying that anywhere I the real world you would be receiving stolen goods but because it's on the internet it's a grey area. 

I personally wouldn't have purchased anything from shogu, especially the motor mounts, as it was common knowledge that he hadn't fulfilled his obligation. But that's just me, to each his own I guess...

I don't think that's the case from what I understand @thisguyhere bought SOME mounts from  shogu,

My understanding is that he purchased the "remaining" mounts from shogu, which absolutely means he is in position of mounts that were previously paid for.  

[quote="willpark16, post:582, topic:20795"]
please don't make these allegations to one of the few honest sellers.
[/quote]
I very specifically said that I didn't blaim @rwxr and never mentioned @thisguyhere.  So please don't make allegations that I made allegations as that would be taking my words out of context. 

I have not posted very much on this specifically because I'm so fucking pissed about it.  I, like everyone else on the planet, don't like paying for stuff and then not getting it.  That feeling is exacerbated when someone else has my shit and is selling it to yet someone else.  So forgive me, but I'll say whatever I want as long as it's logical and truthful.  As it has always been.

You can argue semantics all you want but that doesn't change the fact that **remaining** means all that is left or still existing. That means my goods that weren't sent were obviously part of what's remaining so he's selling my shit. 

I don't even care anymore, I just ain't gonna take being chastised when I was the one stolen from. You turned this into a thing by calling me out.

so when i first floated the idea of taking over the group buy away from shogu was the first time he disappeared into his deployment.

then, when he got back and sent out the orders months after they were expected, i figured he'd fulfill everyone's orders correctly without issues.

then after that, shogu hit me up to see if my offer still stood.  at this point i'd already received my initial order, a bunch of people on thread were confirming also.  i was operating on good faith that everyone's mounts had been delivered.  i could not have possibly anticipated all of these issues then.

it's easy to say i should not have taken over the group buy, that i should have known the mounts i was getting had been previously paid for.  i was not expecting this, nor am i sure is even happening.

for those who have not received their mounts, it is possible that it's lost in post.  and also possible, more likely, that shogu got the delivery details wrong and these shipments are just lost in purgatory.

i'm not here to fuck anyone over, i've fulfilled a bunch of orders by now, all taken care of quickly and without issues.  if i can fix the outstanding issues i would more than happy to, but not at my own expense.

That's kind if the issue right there....it's at MY expense, and everyone else that hasn't gotten the goods they paid for. I'm not saying you are personally responsible in a legal sense. I'm saying that you NOW know that shogu screwed a bunch if people and are unwilling to do anything about it.  

You could have offered those people a replacement at your cost and not lost a penny, but that didn't happen. I'm sure there are other solutions but like I said, I don't really give a damn. I just think it's a little sleezy to make a profit on a thing when there are people who have already paid for the thing but haven't received the thing.

yes, super shitty that people didn't get their orders.

but why do i have to pay for someone else's transgressions?

you make it sound like i colluded with shogu to fuck over a bunch of people, and then turn around and sell those mounts at a profit.

you're asking for a great deal of altruism here, maybe i'm a lesser of a person than you but it's just not something i'm willing to do.

but i do have a plan.

let's get a head count of all the missing orders.

then try to get @treenutter or maybe even @onloop to contact @Shogu12 officially to see if he can answer to the missing orders.

if we can get shogu to recognize that there's missing orders, then he can pay me to fulfill those orders.

what say you?

I specifically did not make a PayPal claim because I didn't wanna cause @thisguyhere or @rwxr the legal headache that would've resulted when it came to light that the "remaining" product had been sold without completing the initial order.

I never said he is selling the ones that Shogu might have sent me...you're actually casting a wild accusation at me which is incorrect dude.

...but he may well be unknowingly, given @Shogu12 has decided to blank the forum members and not provide any info. let alone a track number, who knows "what's what" beyond Shogu? (rhetorical). 

In in fact was active in making excuses for Shogu when he was on deployment since that was beyond his control, I even paid as F&F since his pre-deployment activity showed him to be intelligent in his CAD designing, dilligent in his responses & responsible due to his active service, that turned out to be a mistake on my part. 

In fact he represented the airforce pretty candidly in this forum and that should be fed back to the airforce in terms of their internal disciplinary...US members who got burned consider that possibility. Think Alextech - responsible adult~responsible organisation.

**What I would say is at the time of the mass selloff there was already a lot of grumblings and if I were tempted in taking over the remaining stock and making a few bucks I probably would have waited for Shogu to dispense with his responsibilities to original buyers including me.**

I might add at the higher price and given a mistake on my part I'm out  €72, I could have a pair of @WSB's mounts..which I do now(Series-0 -thanks) and intend getting more from a seller who actually cares about their reputation & how they handle themselves.

I got my 2 initially ordered sets. But my third set, which I have ordered still before the batch was sent out still not received.

I paid with PP F&F with the feeling this would be better for @Shogu12. But in the end It's still frustrating that this trust is shattered into pieces and no answer is coming after writing him days ago. I would be happy if I only get my money for the third set back. 

Hope he will come up with a solution. Hiding is not a solution. Neither for him nor for us.

Still nothing here in Ireland.

Jayme Steffen you're still checking in here, given the amount of people who have not received mounts, why not simply give out tracking info?

Maybe some people here screwed you over when you were deployed, is that it? Did they do the paypal refund thing then get their mounts anyway? Did some people even threaten you? Well I think there are plenty who would appear to have trusted you, been reasonable and have that trust & understanding shoved right back in their faces.

It's really not cool man to do what you're doing, and the internet remembers who you are when you think this no longer matters someone you know or want to know will see this thread and right now you are not smelling good....

@raadio13 I'm with you. The only way he would ever think twice about ripping someone off is if he has real consequences. I think the best thing we could do to get our money or mounts and switches is by contacting his commanding officer. Someone said they had access to his Facebook. If you could please pass me his info I'll take care of it. Being stolen from always feels personal to me. What really gets me though was that he blamed his deployment for the delays. He's shown no signs of remorse and absolutely no consideration for the people he took money from. The only thing that will make a difference here and in the future are real life consequences. It's not something I'm comfortable with and I've been going back and forth on this for a while. I can't think of anything else that will really matter. Personally I think he ended up using the time his post about being deployed bought him to get the cash out of his PayPal account. I'm not sure how long the holds are now but PayPal holds onto payments for purchases for a while unless certain requirements are met by the seller before hand. Plus they're only responsible for considering a dispute for a short period of time after payment. If the seller can clear the cash and stall a dispute long enough they're pretty much in the clear. It's been a while but I've seen the same tactics used on eBay and on other forums. 

Even though I didn't pay F&F and he didn't respond they didn't return my money. I can't understand why they denied the claim so I need to follow up by phone. I really should have taken my money back and moved on long ago. Unfortunately I wanted the parts more than I wanted to believe he wouldn't come through. 

There's still a chance if PayPal won't or can't help you. If you used a credit card or a debit card with a VISA logo, AMEX logo any other a credit card company logo you may be coved. Usually cards like that are backed by fraud dispute policies that are similar to their credit card policies. The next step for me is to call and follow up with PayPal. If that doesn't work then I'm filing a credit card dispute. I hope this helps some of you too.

I was also promptly blocked after, and didn't get a chance to reply.
Fact is that I never provided my adress, as I wasn't sure where the mounts were to be sent to. I also never got a tracking number, nor did I open a paypal dispute. Probably got me mixed up with one of you guys. 
I just might sent a message to his mum anyway.

So ive just been sat here reading the posts and have a strong urge to send messages of my own . . . I do . . . But i think i have a stronger desire to not let this guy annoy me more than he already has. Yes im only out one mount (£30ish) and i know people are out more ££ than me, but i am going to forget about it. i would much rather be £30 down than not be able to use this fantastic forum (or have to hide on it with a different username). 

In hindsight i would have paid a bit extra and purchased from other websites owned by members of this forum, and not paid friends and family :/ 

On a positive note, I have just got an urban carver with 2 vesc6 :) . . . (I think that has helped me muster up a forgiving attitude :) 

So @Shogu12 please enjoy a beer and a burger on me and no, i do not wish you choke on it.

I tried to reach to him through PM & Email but without avail.

It is one thing not answering because you have really No Time or no Access to a PC or Internet but he logged in here when already question appeared but he didn't gave a f* to answer these.

Now thinking that with not communicating with those people who paid for their goods and didn't receive anything you can get away (with their hard earned money) without scratches?

In my opinion you are not acting in your favor. You need to live your whole life with this knowing you screwed people over.

So for f-ing sake do something, show yourself to the problem. We are still the one who would like to get this Group buy to a positive ending for all of us.

If this is him than ... Man, thats ugly!
This piece of sh*t..

Usually I'm not that easily pissed of by someone but what happened and happens here is beyond my comprehension.

I have no words for that.

In meantime: How many of you didn't get the ordered Sets?

Me: 1

There's like 75 typos per line in whatever that is, even the time of day is a typo.  I wouldn't trust a single thing on that site.

Not one word.

Right?  I got one but not the rest, waited to long to get a PayPal refund. Lesson learned.  It's installed in my ointail, works great. Good design, terrible vendor.
