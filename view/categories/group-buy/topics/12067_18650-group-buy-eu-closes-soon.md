Hey folks,
I am going to buy some 18650 cells ([Samsung 30Q](https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html)) from nkon.nl. So i decided to make it as a group buy that we maybe can profit from the group discount.

I am located in germany.
Shipping can be choosen and calculated at a later time for each person individually.
I planed to buy the cells **this** year.
if you are interessted **write me a pm!!!** Then i will update this post with the summary. **This thread** is only for Q&A!

Me: 80 cells
@TarzanHBK: 80 cells

Current price per cell: **3,80€**

what setup do you want to build them? These are all low output cells, the max output is 15A, so not really healthy in a standard 10s4p for example

There are much cheaper cells with higher output in an pack like that.

Nkon = 90 cells a 3,95€
ES = cell a 3,59$ = 3,29€
Difference per cell: 0,66€
100 Cells = 66€

I would save at least 66€ and i could save more when i buy the removed weld cells ;)

## \#7 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2016-10-28T10:19:58.969Z Reads: 263

```
if you do the calculation on 90cells you also have to take the 90cell price from ES which is 3.79$

nkon goes as low as €3.65 with the right amount of cells.
Also you get a receipt and tax invoice - not sure what will happen when something goes wrong with the ES cells. Probably no warranty of any kind.

no go got that wrong. He like to get the sano ga which is ok to use at about 5amp before you start killing it.
so even in a 10s10p ga kit, it would deliver 50amp and who wants to carry a board with 100 cells.

So im wondering what you are about to do @DeathCookies :smiley:?

a hill and 100kg is probably too much for a 40amp regulated vesc.

and you´ll always want to have a bit room don´t you? Even on a 80amp battery im fearing of hurting the battery going full throttle :D

so which config do you like to go? 10sXp? and what other components? how much do you weight?

Do you plan to use this for a mountainboard? .. will try to get my wattmeter working to tell how much 6s 192kv and 4.33 gearing consumes.. So far, from theory it has been around 19-20wh per km..though, I need to do more careful tests as I have not taken careful measurement of average speed, the stops and some other stuff.

I also had the choice to go with sanyo's, though they also seemed way too weak for building a pack.. (at least in 4p configuration).


---

So I got my wattmeter working! Today when going against wind and pushing at around ~25-30kph my setup pulled ~60Amps / 1200watts. Max speed I got was around 35kph but I think the wind put quite a pressure on the motor / system as I could feel that it was hard to move forward.

I use Sony VTC 4, which are rated for somewhat like 23A, even though some labels say they are 30A. So it is hard to guess now whenever batteries were not able to push harder or is it because of 6s voltage.

---

I also plan to add a 3d printed fan to my motor, as the motor was a bit warm after this ride and I want to ''heat-proof'' it, so that I dont have to worry if it gets too warm or not (when not riding on best terrain)

First you go with low discharge high capacity cells - now you want the complete opposite. Why didn't you go for something in the middle?

Because i have read carfully the topic "[Lets talk about voltage sag](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lets-talk-about-voltage-sag-poll/12085)" and a mix of both worlds (capacity and discharge) would be too expensive.

I am currently using a set of jacob hubs and think that i will need more current than initially expected. 

I need to log some real world data for the battery consumption to plan my build correctly... but for that i am missing a uart plug (thanks to cutting costs in the new vesc series...).

If that is really your concern you should go with A123 cells instead.
How many cells do you want to use in parallel?
In my opinion you should just go with Samsung 25R - best of both worlds and cheap.

```
The whole argument about voltage sag relies on the fact of how much difference there is between actual consumption and current rating.
So deciding on which battery should come after deciding on the current you want/are going to use.
A battery with 10A rating at 10P will be perfectly fine when your goal is 100A.
A battery with 20A rating at 5P will be perfectly fine.
A battery with 30A rating at 3P will be equally fine.

You are not going to use 100A however as that would equal 100A*50V = 5KW (I assumed 12S, at 10S it would still be 4.2KW) - that is way too much and will just make you street your face.

I already have the motors. Now i Need to measure what current i use at max. 
When i have the Max value i can add 20% or more breathing room and now how much my battery should provide.

how are you going to measure that when you don't have batteries? Also you don't actually need to do this. You can just use the already established numbers: anything above 60A should be fine (remember a space cell has a 40A fuse as a comparison) - with Hub motors 80A will give you some breathing room. Anything above is ridiculous and the VESC rated at just 50A anyway.

i´d pick one of the common cells like 25r or hg2. Run them at least in 10s4p and you´re good to go. I´m planning hg2 at the moment in the next 2 builds. 10s4p with dual 6355 190kv. Both heavy rider at above 90kg and some good hills. I´m going with a 80A fuse and should be fine in every situation. There shouldn´t be any voltage sag

Currently I can ride with my dual hub drive (2x (11S LiPo + VESC + Jacob Hub)) test board. I am testing my stuff with LiPo Cells but i want to change it to Li-Ion. Before i can measure my setup i need some nasty "micro JST" plugs (the white plug in the picture) to use my hc-05 module...

Have you guys looked at Sony's VTC6's?
By far the best performing cell at currents above 10A. Voltage sag is minimal and heating only becomes an issue with continuous 15+A. 

The Samsungs 30Q and LG HG2, although great at handling the voltage sag above 10A, have issues with heat at any continuous discharge above 10A. Plus both of these have worse total capacity than VTC6s in my tests. 

If you aren't going above 10A/cell. I recommend the Panasonic GA's. They do not heat up any more than the other cells at these currents, but provide a whooping 10% increase in capacity. The trade being power as the voltage sag is real with these...

## \#45 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-12-04T09:23:15.781Z Reads: 117

I assume the second name for thesse panasonic GA cells are sanyo cells.. at least that's how I recognize a cell with 10A discharge and about 3.150 ah capacity..

Though, it looks like at least 6+ of these in parallel would be needed, perhaps even 8P to have a bit more room.

That would make a really nice ~18-22 ah pack, of course.. but with relatively big size, as a lot of longboard ppl probably make something like 3P / 4P

This is ai a continuous discharge of 10A

Not according to this graph, I cannot share my research (work related) but my work usually confirms Henrik's results. I will tell you that if youre running HG2 above 15A, you need some serious airflow over them. In lab conditions, they heat up from 25c to 85-90c during discharge. The spec sheet says max temp during discharge is 60c or 70c. Cant remember. While the VTC6 max temp is 80c.  

Below 15A, if what youre looking for is power then the VTC6 is it, as shown above...

I guess I did not make it clear: Personally I will never need that much nickel to get to 10m (which is the only reasonable amount). It is only worth doing if other people also chime in and we share the strips in the end. Keep in mind they are double the width - so you only need half the length if you cut them to size. I will only need maybe 3m. So we need another 7m until it is worth buying for me.

Alright I see, so i don´t think there will be enough people for the special nickel strips here.
nkon.nl is shipping them seperatly to the people, so i won´t have any problems with shipping.
Also i just asked DHL about EU shipping for over 30 cells and i will report back as soon as I get an answer. (I may be offering spotwelding cells and ship them to EU people)

yeah, you have to put special label, identify the goods etc. Our packs are made by a professional company with all the appropriate certifications/insurance; It's not like a DIY guy doing packs in his saloon  :slight_smile:

this increases spot strength as the current has to travel around the slot when spot welding.

I could chime in for the nickel strips.. but it has to be really low cost ( the shipping, for me to order it )

What's the fuss anyways about 10 METERS of nickel strips ? It is meters right? 

I think I could easly order 2 meters alone.. if I have to weld let's say 10 cell packs with 10centimeter in each run for each of their sides (so 20 strips x 10cm = 200cm = 2m)

mh okay.. that's is about half of nkon's original pricing if you order some batteries

Slots do sound really good!.. I've seen them being used on power tool batteries ;)

How about if a company (electric company) order some? Just asked my brother in law if its cheaper if he buys them right to his company.

Just to give a heads up on sending spot welded batteries:
AFAIK DPD is one of the rare companies that allows dangerous goods to be sent with them in Germany. However the goods need to comply with "ADR Kapitel 3.3 Sondervorschrift 188" which states: 
Max Energy of a permissible lithium battery is 100Wh

Any idea if i can use these without bms. Wondering how good quality these are compared for example to LG HE4. 
Or then I just buy smaller bms and bypass discharge.
```

That's what I will do.. BMS bypassing discharge. BMS which can handle 60A or more A discharge are pretty expensive I think..
