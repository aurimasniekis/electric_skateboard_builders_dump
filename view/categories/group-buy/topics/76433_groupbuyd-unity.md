Starting a new thread, for everyone involved in this group buy:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-unity-group-buy/67817/1

Enertion's about to ship the Unity, I think we can start collecting funds and shipping details so we can get these to you as quickly as possible.

I know this was said before:

[quote="thisguyhere, post:4, topic:67817"]
should be $230 shipped when they‚Äôre here.
[/quote]

But...

![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/528/tyler.jpg)

Price is basically $240, plus shipping, so $245 a unit.  Those of you with multiple units, there is no shipping added to each additional unit.  This is about $55 cheaper than getting it direct.

Please locate your name in the table below, and send funds to the appropriate person (me or @ksfacinelli).

You decide which type of payment (friends or family / goods and services) you want to use.  Prices are noted.

# Please include your esk8.builders handle, and full shipping details in the payment.

If yes, could I join if I'm from Poland? (how much would be the shipment?).

not sure, probably no group buy anytime soon.

enertion is demanding 100 units for the discount price, that's a $20k usd order, not sure if there's enough demand right now.

however, put you on the standby list just in case

Kevin is not that type of dude. He had plenty of chnace to run with away with much more money. He is pretty slow to respond, I don't disagree but give him time. He said he was trying to figure out best possible way to ship international. I bought two unities from him and he kept good communication with me. My suggestion would be to email him instead of a pm on here. But do as you wish.

Just a heads up for all - he was communicating with me a few weeks ago via email and I had no problems with him. I don't think he's out to screw anybody - as mentioned above, I'd expect there's some rather "extreme* extenuating circumstances going on. Maybe there's a forum vet that has his phone number or something

I would like to know who received his unity and who not.
I will tag all people listed in the google form even if it‚Äôs not actual. 
If I missed somebody, please tag this person.
It‚Äôs already over one month since @ksfacinelli has been online.
As i still believe he is a honest guy, I worry a bit that all is good with him...
If somebody has some contact data like mail or phone or live in Minneapolis and know where he lives it would be great if you could try to contact him and see how is the situation.
Maybe @thisguyhere you have some more information?

I had reserved a spot on his GB for 2, I also got one on Jlabs GB and 2 direct from enertion. 
there was a mix up with those, but have since been worked out and I have received the 3 units.
For the 2 reserved I haven't paid for them yet, because I was waiting for a response to PM and for the others to turn up before paying for more.

@CarlCollins can we get you involved in this before paypal does. 
@Frenchy has a unity order paid for and pending with @ksfacinelli. 
We understand things happen and just want to advocate the solution before it goes too far. 
@Frenchy if you will give me a day to look into this I will try to get your unity for you, or at least some answers, Cool?

@hyperIon1
We shipped Cory 2 separate consignments of Unitys 
1: His personal group buy 
2: Enertion Unity shipments to US customers

We have checked and confirmed that all of the 1st batch US orders have been fulfilled and the item already delivered 

Group buy is something which he arranged personally from his stock,
Non-officially

@Frenchy I am able to ask him about it but I am not sure he will get back to me.

P.S: I will ask him

This is pure speculation, but I think there may have been a genuine mixup on inventory and he might be trying to sort that with enertion. I was supposed to get mine from thisguyhere on the roster, but I sent my money to ks thinking he was the one collecting all money. He sent me a Unity as I'd paid him, I just think since he got the money he presumed I was on his list. So just from me, he would theoretically be down a unit. This is why thisguyhere had some spare that I think he sold to others at this point. It's hard to tell, but I still don't think he's intentionally trying to fuck anybody in the slightest. More communication would probably be nice, but if it is like I think, he may very well feel like shit about it and be trying to fix it behind the scenes with enertion.
