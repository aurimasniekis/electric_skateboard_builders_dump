## ENERTION R-SPEC 6355 MOTORS - GROUP BUY OFFER
**LIMITED OFFER  >**[ **NOW ONLY $99USD**](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/copy-of-190kv-electric-skateboard-motor-6355/)

As some of you already know Enertion HQ is in Australia, So I normally keep stock of motors in the Enertion HQ warehouse in Australia then ship them 1000's of km's to each of my customers.

However, this is very inefficient and adds to the cost of the individual item! Also, means higher shipping charges & also for my loyal overseas customers often means really high import taxes!!

So over the last few months we have been working hard to try to optimize our supply chain and we are now very excited to announce we have now established distributors in **Belgium & United States** that can ship to our customers much faster & at lower prices.

So now we need to stock up the warehouses with enough stock to meet the growing worldwide demand for the **notorious R-SPEC 6355 motors** that are well loved by many builders of EsK8 worldwide. [Check out all the user builds that are using the R-SPEC motor.](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search?q=r-spec%20category%3A10)


We have a large production order that's just started with our factory and to help us work out the quantity we need to send to each country we would like to offer the hottest deal yet - **Order your R-SPEC now at heavily reduced prices!!**

Very nice offer!!  Doubting if I should get one and do the @longhairedboy color stripping technique for mounts on the engine (blue messes up my color scheme). Or just get a black motor elsewhere..  ðŸ™ƒ you're making it very difficult!

US customer here - it's definitely not there anymore. 

Curious to know what happened to it as well since I just placed my order for one two days ago.

6374 is sold out... so you order could be waiting for it to arrive.

as nice as these motors are wouldn't a turngy 6364 be more powerful (larger magnet and stator) and cheaper?   a turnigy 6374 would be a lot more powerful and still cheaper.

Does you have the stator measurements? Get them and compare.

i've owned the tacon 110 (which is the same size as your 6355) , the tacon 160 (which is 10mm bigger) and the sk3 6374 (which is 20mm bigger).   The tacon 160 and the sk3 6374 were more powerful that the 6355.   

Your r-specs _**might**_ be a few percent better than the tacon 110  (no one knows if they're actually any better than the cheap tacons tbh) but no way can they make up the difference in 18% and 36% ,respectively, longer can size.

@onloop Makes sense that it's gone on the site then. I thought it was being discontinued already and gone completely...

I already received shipment and tracking information through e-mail. Does that mean that I'll probably see the motor in a different package later on?

Thanks. Any idea when they'll be back, and will they be available with the same kind of sweet deal for us Euro-folk?
