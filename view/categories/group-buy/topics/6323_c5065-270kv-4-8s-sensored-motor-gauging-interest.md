These motors are about $47 USD on eBay right now, with $3 shipping to Washington from China. In my opinion you have a very good price unless the shipping turns out to be >$20.

I would agree with you...that why I'm try to gauge the interest ... 

Don't wanna really make up a number to these people like 50 when only 10 people are interested in a 50mm motor

Need some real ammo

Are you referring to the shipping I would charge you in the US?   Not sure what you are saying here...

If your worried abt shipping cost ...I would only charge the exact cost it would cost to ship from Vegas

Edit: I see ur in Canada ... Not sure what the cheapest shipping option would be for you

Sorry, I'm pulling an all-nighter. Disregard that. What I mean to say is that it's probably cheaper for some people to buy from that one eBay seller right now, since their shipping is so cheap. Here's the [link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/C5065-270KV-4-6S-electric-Skate-Scooter-Skateboard-brushless-Sensored-motor-/172233379751?hash=item2819e8cfa7:g:eN4AAOSwnFZXVs2p).

@Michaelinvegas so I've never used a Sensored motor before, what is the advantage in going that route vs a non-Sensored motor?

Better startup torque.

Wow, major difference at low speed. When my motor eventually dies I'll probably use one of these, especially since my ESC has a sensor port...

It's a really nice price if they're good.
I could be in for a couple, but what Vlad said is relevant:
The shipping price from Hongkong to Ukraine stated on the ebay page is a mere 6$.

quite a few people on ES have had terrible experiences with NTM motors.  I, personally, would stay away from them.   Hobbyking currently has the  SK3 - 5065-275kv in both their east and west warehouses.   Why you would buy the NTM's when the SK3's have proven performance and durability?

 And Sk has 6mm shaft at those can sizes....

50mm are only good for flats ...unless u have a dual...
