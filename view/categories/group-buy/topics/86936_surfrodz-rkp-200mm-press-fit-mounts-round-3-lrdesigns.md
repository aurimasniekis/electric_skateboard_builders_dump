```
This is **round 3** of my sufrodz press fit mounts for RKP 200mm hangers.

* These come as a set of two, left and right.
* Motor to motor distance is 168mm, (cross bar length). So 80mm long motors fit.
* The mounts are set inwards of the end of the hanger 16mm which allows you to use the standard 70mm Surf Rodz axles. Though requires a pulley that has some internal clearance, like [fatboy](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/fatboy-pulleys) or @dickyho with a little grinding.  Pulleys that are flat on the end can be used too but you will need longer axles and extra spacer. 
* Holes are made to fit @marcmt88 motor plates, and now plates by @Boardnamics and @moon . 
* **Price is $54 usd** which includes all costs, shipping, paypal fees, currency conversion and packing materials. (Motor plates is separate charge once price on those is finalized.) 
* My Paypal address is lukeritchiedesigns at gmail dot com
* This time around I plan to order 25 sets pretty early in the game as I feel fairly confident I can sell them all. If one or two more people pay I will have enough money to give the deposit to the factory and start production. Should result in a much faster turn around.

More info and photos on the previous two group buy threads. Seems like everyone was very happy with the quality and design.

Its really cool that @Boardnamics and @moon are making motor plates to fit these mounts. Boardnamics is making 15 sets of aluminum mounts with idlers, and moon is making 5 sets of carbon motor plates. Though @SeanHacker has already snatched up 3 of the 5 sets. These will look something like the below pics. Prices on the plates is not finalized yet, will let you know about that later.

I am also working on some 3D printables that will allow other things to attach to mounts on the front, like rain guards or headlights.

This is what they look like fresh of the CNC.

So the new mount has a ctc of 112.5mm. Weight I cannot tell you for certain but based on the mounts Ive made in the past carbon fiber is pretty damn light

Motor plates are separate but still plent to go around.

Those are my gear drive plates

I can't figure out the length of the crossbars since I don't have the setup, maybe someone can tell me the length of their crossbars with this setup and the thickness of their plate

Yes it's final but if there's something im missing that it's fine to fix it, anything you want to change?

## \#52 Posted by: Mikenopolis Posted at: 2019-03-23T05:38:49.569Z Reads: 158

The crossbars length and sourcing is a mystery for me. Maybe @marcmt88 can share that info?

The only potential change is would there be a need for the slots to adjust motor position if an idler is used? I primarily use idlers so that the position of both motors are the same. I'm not sure how CF works, but having adjustable motor AND adjustable idler means cutting out more material, is that going to an issue?

Can I ask why in my mined I‚Äôm thinking you could resin a threaded insert in a bit of rod. I have no real knolage of the property‚Äôs of carbon fibre (apart from its light and strong and ridged) so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a weak way ou using the material or some thing?

Definitely include the rods. No reason not to have them since they protect the motors for rear mounting and also reduces the potential bending/stress from the motor‚Äôs torque

Some people will be getting their press fit mounts soon. 

I need to update the instructions as there is a couple extra notes gathered along the way. 

1. **Remove the grub screw.** I also like to fill the hole with hotglue to help prevent water getting into the axle and rusting it. 
2. **Check hanger for road rash.** If your truck is not brand new, check it for any rock dents or road rash on the ends that will be covered with the mount. These need to be filed down or it will be difficult to get the mount all the way down and also removing it later will be a problem. 
3. **Press on the mount.** Add a smidge of grease to the hanger for easier removal in the future. **Line up the circle on the back with the grub screw hole side**, push the mount on by hand. Press the mount the rest of the way in with the axle and a bunch of spacers. Do not use too much force or you could damage the threads, just as tight as you would do up the wheel. It only needs to be on there firm. If there is a small gap in the axle hole don't worry about it. 
4. **Screw on your prefered motor plates** with M4X10 bolts and your done!

So ordered 30 Black, 20 Silver. Leftovers are there. Same with the plates, had to order more for logistical reasons

A spacer between the bracket and the motor plate would solve alignment issues.  But your pulleys don't clear the brackets.

@JLabs

It was designed with the pulley sitting over the end of the mount a little to allow use of 70mm axels. Your pulleys can be used with some longer axels and spacers though.

For some reason I had in my head that the crossbar(s) only fit the long mounts. I got the short mounts so I didn‚Äôt request a crossbar. 
If there‚Äôs still one (a crossbar) available I‚Äôd like to get one. 


Cant wait either way!

Pretty sure @Boardnamics is still making some compatible plates? But I think he was swamped with other orders. 

Or @Moon's gear drive. How is that going by the way?
