Need some more BMS's so Im making another one
If you want custom specs just point that out and I will forward that to them

Last time the total price was about 60$ per bms **shipped i**f you order 2 or more shipping can be cheaper,prices may vary

Contact me for any questions

Currently only 5 spots available if there is a need I can organize more group buys since I also need a lot of BMS's

Also they produce them on order so its about 2 weeks after the payment for them to ship
Just pm me with the bms you need and I will ask them for price

**SPOTS AVAILABLE: 2**
