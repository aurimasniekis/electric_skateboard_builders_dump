Jehu's just posted a video about getting access to a crap load of news cells through some company going bankrupt. 

https://youtu.be/MaP2hfNil9A

Of those cells is the Sony VTC6. They're selling them for $3.5 a piece in 200 count increments.

They're bare and need to be insulated. 

Any need for this? They're slightly better performing than the 30q, a bit less sag so probably slightly higher capacity.

Yeah I'd be interested in some, but nowhere near the 200 quantity required.

I use 30Q before switch to vt6 much better a little less sag more power full more range also  
And they donâ€™t get the problem to get unbalanced easily like the 30Q 
Much better on any point 
I will donâ€™t go back to 30Q for sure 
Only problem hard to find them at good price

You're ordering 200 packs of 200, so 40,000 cells

30amp I do  believe, thats why they are sweet!!

I really would like 60 for a 12s5p AWD build I have coming up so I can get 35 batt amps per motor instead of 25 per like on a 30q 12s5p.

Itâ€™s more 15a (30a only for short period)

If you want to get more power, better use vtc5a (25a continues discharge)(or vtc6a if you can find them somewhere)

You should ask @thisguyhere. Jehu lives in LA I believe Idk if you can get 12 directly from him.

On the other hand if you are in SF Bay area. Come to me.

Not without external cooling which the 30Qs can do as well. 

I'll post something detailed tonight but in general the VTC6s are just a touch better in performance, not by a huge margin and they usually cost 50% more. I'd buy whichever is cheaper.

awesome, thanks for the heads up.  I am thinking I will stick to 30qs if this is the case!

It comes to about the same price as 30qs when you buy from nkon. So a touch better is still better.
