I didnt know this information until now

The enclosure has enough space to fit a 12S3P made out of 18650s cells a BMS for charging and dual ECSs. You could also get creative an fit a 10S4P. There is also a double stacked cells version on the works for a whooping 12S6P battery pack.

It’s possible. I don’t want to tread on anyone’s toes though. 
If it doesn’t make financial sense to ship the enclosures around the world I’ll look into it. 
I’d have to get my hands on a deck though.

@JLabs
Just checked your website and there the Tayto
is on sale too.
So basically it’s the same price like the group buy, which means if I would order from you directly I even come cheaper as I pay shipping only to me which is also more cheap than the shipping from England.
Plus, I wouldn’t need to pay import taxes as it’s price don’t exceed the import tax limit of my country.
Don’t get it wrong, but shouldn’t be there an advantage in a group buy?
I mean even if it comes out 1 by 1 from the price @moon still has the work to do and the risk that packets get lost etc.

Don’t want to complain, it’s already a good price.
just don’t make a sense to pay more and wait longer with the group buy than to buy directly from you.

Personally I dont like using inserts on the spud/tayto. There is only 1 or 2 mm left with an 8mm insert. I drill all the way through as seen in the picture in the first post. 

Decks are delayed at least 2 weeks, should have known dealing with ABEC that this was going to happen. Im trying to make sure it isint any more.

You can just buy directly from my website if your in the USA 

https://buildkitboards.com/products/bkb-tayto-31-deck

EU orders will be shipped to moon and then he will distribute. 

I may be able to get @moon boxes too if they fit nicely in the main shipping box. Just ordered a custom size today.

From what I can read here it looks like you are waiting for 1 more order to do the groupe buy?
I have already ordered 4 Tayto a long time ago I'm waiting for from bkb shop. And I'm located in EU. So if he ships all the orders here with my 4 decks to me you don't have to wait for one more order. Or have you already collect orders for a groupe buy to happen?

Hi

I am not sure if you know how group buy works but you joined my one a couple months back.

The decks are in the UK now so the wait shouldn't be long

Guys, I've got the stuff laid out on the floor and am working out what goes with what etc.
I've got a query.
There were 4x Single stack eboosted anclosures ordered and paid for.( @angeljmm, @taz, @FredXanadu, @evangreen)   
Now, one of these enclosures seemingly didn't like the idea of being shipped all the way across the ocean to a land with an uncertain future so it decided that it wanted to stay with Uncle Jared..
So what I'm saying is, do one of you guys want volunteer to either;

not have an enclosure and get a refund from @JLabs 

Wait for me to make an enclosure on my deck and send you one of those

Wait for Jared to catch the naughty one, smack it's bum, pack it up and send it over?

For the shipping,
I'm going to get some more boxes and bubble wrap tape etc and beg a donation to cover this.
Then I had the idea that if I packed everyones parcel, then I could send each individual the dimensions and weight and point you to the interparcel site. You could purchase your own shipping, send me the PDF of the shipping label. Then I can print it out, slap it on the parcels and take it to the post office/parcel shop?
For the guys that wanted me to make enclosures I will start the plug this weekend but there'll be a little wait as I'm flat out at real work which is inconvenient to say the least..
If you guys want to remind me who wanted one I'm all ears.

Photo from BigBen last week just thort I’d leave it hear for otheres to see as well. Just wating on a smart BMS to be built and see the sizes the encloser is untill I work out what size battery to make I’m playing with the idea of a 3P 9S T40 because of space restrictions. Any one got any real word exsperiance with these cells? Spec look as tho there a good choice over Q30’s but that doesn’t always follow to be true in pratis. (My main concern is the regen rate of 3p)

Imo for 3p 30T or vtc5a. Charge current for 30t is same as 30q (1.5a, 4a fast). vtc5a is 6a charge.

I’v started to come to the conclusion that the charge current is the biggest limiting factor for my needs of a small pack and your right in the VTC5a only other thing that’s compeating is the 40t has the same charge current but mooch thinks the VTC5a has a better life span at 1.5a
T40 has a better life span at 1a. 

Leaning towards the VTC5a as you sergested or just go with the q30 as there just grate value. Just seems strange we spend 1000+ on a board and try to save a few $ on cells.

Ha, was just thinking about that today.. 
Was looking through the pile and thought, why have I got so many taytos?
I'm off on holiday tomorrow. So have a list for when I get back if that's ok?

of course it is mister! put it at the bottom of your to-do list, lowest priority , it's really not urgent at all.

And don't forget to send me the paypal details so I can pay for it!

Really like the Tayto deck!

My setup:
- 10S2P with Samsung 40T
- 60A smart BMS
- Ownboard hubs their esc and remote
- 4A charger (2x2A standard chargers in parallel)

I've put some griptape on the deck but it's just temporary until I receive my new griptape.
I only need to finish my enclosure :hugs:
