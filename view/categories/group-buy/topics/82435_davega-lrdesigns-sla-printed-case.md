I am doing a short run of 10 pieces of my Davega cases. 

These are SLA printed and are finished with a epoxied in 1.5mm acrylic screen protector and stainless hardware. You just gotta add the davega. 

My case is designed to be 
1. Very tightly packaged around the davega
2. Robust. Can stand on it while riding.
3. Water proof. (Though still waiting on wet season here for testing)

@SeanHacker  contacted me to print him one, so I guess there is others who would like one too. Price is $45 usd including delivery. 

They come grey but if you want me to paint it black +$5. I have to paint before glueing in the screen. The paint will wear off if your stepping on it though. 

If your interested sign up here and send the money to my paypal, I already started making a few. Will ship them out as completed.

You can get davega kits here
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-second-batch/82070?u=lrdesigns

You can print your own too if you like I have it on thingieverse. Just note it was not designed to be easy to print on a FDM printer. Tolerances are tight and there a few thin wall areas. I think it can still be done if your printer is well tuned. 

The davga pcb need to be moded slightly to fit. Drill the mount holes from M2 to M3 and round the corners with some sandpaper. 

The angled base riser has holes to fit over the truck bolts "old school" spacing. And is designed to be held down with 3M VHB double tape. 

And it will fit 3 waterproof buttons from here.

Slightly of topic but I though I would ask. Would printing with flexible filament on a fdm printer give a simlar fit/finish? @lrdesigns

Would be cool looking! I have found flexible to be very challenging to print complex shapes though, so I would think is a hard print in flexible. And the clear screen might not stay in that well if the hole case is flexed.

@Irdesigns If I ordered this could you do a Trampa style mounting bracket???

One that would cover the whole front area of the truck part of the board?? :D

If I cant ping someone does that mean ive been blocked :rofl:

Maybe, I'm not really sure how to start though. I don't have a mountain board to check fitment. The base portion would have to be flat rather than angled so it would take up more volume to fit the buttons, might turn out a bit boxy. Or the buttons could be on the front and have it angle the opposite way. 

I have no idea why you can't send a PM? Your a regular. Is it just me you cant message?

Goodpoint. maybe the casing could be made in a siloutette style? Parallel to the lines of the board but not extending that far, picture of what I mean in paint =')

I would just really like your thing for a speed and battery setup, the feather remote for the estop and other features and then a metr for data logging :rofl:

Issue with my design is that it's only designed to work with the wide Trampa trucks as that's all I have. It won't work if using the inner spring position on the trucks which allow both. 
I've been speaking with someone local to me who's looking to add DAVEga to his builds which use the two position trucks so I will look at modifying it sometime soon.

waterproofing with hotglue
[/quote]

Use MG Chemicals Silicone Modified Conformal Coating in the 55ml brush-on bottle.  Hot glue sucks for waterproofing.  It cracks and breaks away, allowing a crack for water ingress.  Hot glue is good for some things but waterproofing isn't one of them.

Ordered a second one. Just to let you know, the base broke after 500 meters with the vibration, so i'm not recommending to install it with the base plate. I'm using industrial velcro now.

Same for me on both my cases. I snapped the corners off and sanded to round them out. Just using some loctite double sided tape. Works perfect.

How did you mount it exactly? Not sure I really get what happened. Its not designed to be bolted down its mean to be 3M double tapped down. The holes are just so you can still access your truck bolts. 

Also @SeanHacker how was yours mounted?

This is how mine is mounted with 3M VHB tape stuck to my reinforcing plated. The truck bolts do not hold down the davega.

![IMG_1773|666x500](upload://wx2AFv0L1wi2FtjBMHO1r3MXiun.jpeg) 

If they were not bolted down and it was just vibration I think maybe I could add some ribs to make the flat part of the base a bit stronger. What you think?

Same as yours at first. But vibration killed mine. I actually like it better how mine is now though. I just cut a 1/8in truck riser to size after breaking off the corners and sanding them, super glued it to the bottom, and used the double sided tape. Works perfect.

Well not 100%, no water got in the case where the davega is but some got in between the base plate / bottom side and got into the connector that connects to the wire that goes to the vesc. 

It still worked normally but when I booted it up it said unknown error and set my total trip distance to 9000km :laughing: then a random distance on each boot. Weird. :face_with_monocle:

The davega is attached to the base plate with 4 pieces of double tape instead of a full perimeter which leaves some gapes for water to get in. Does not help hitting big puddles at speed I guess.

![image|666x500](upload://iR8t5JhUZA7Ayi8WOGT7ZFKJ3li.jpeg) 

Cleaned out the connector with some alcohol and it’s good now. 

Temp fix till I redo the double tape. Also not hitting big puddles on purpose. :yum:
