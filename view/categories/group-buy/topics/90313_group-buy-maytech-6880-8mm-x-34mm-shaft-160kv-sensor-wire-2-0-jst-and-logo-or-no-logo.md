Ok Guys, 

 I have spoken to the rep.

 The 6880 motor can be made with a

* 10mm shaft machined down to 8mm x 34mm for gears 8mm wide.

* The KV can be customized to 160

* custom length phase wires

* correct JST 2.0 for the sensor wires 100mm longer than phase wire

* logo or no logo

We have worked closely with Maytech on the materials, connectors, procedures, and quality of their motors to address some areas that needed improvement in hopes of bringing a higher quality product to the community

This will be the first time these are made with this  can size, kV, and shaft

50 units MOR (minimum order requirement).  

Cost per unit is $140
shipping will be assessed at the time of payment depending on your location. 

We have an affiliate now in the EU we can ship EU orders to direct from the factory and only shipping to the final destination will be needed beyond order payment. 

Please let me know what you think (community)

Is this only limited to 6880 motors or are you able to mix other size motors? 

I'm interested in 6355 motors at 160kv.

At the moment this is only for the 6880 motors. 
I can ask about winding 2 6365 at 160kv and the cost. 

In order to get the desired 6880, we would need 50.

* 2 x 10mm shaft

In the EU

Is there import duties necessary to pay on top for EU or is that factored into that price? Aware that we need to pay for onwards EU shipping to our location, that‚Äôs üòé

Thanks

Are we still able to order the 190kv variant with this Group Buy?

When you say you've worked with them on connectors etc, I don't suppose you've managed to get them to not coat their phase wires with that God-awful enamel that people seem to be having great difficulty removing effectively?

Yes, the Phase wires will be regular silicone coated instead of the enamel stuff.

we can order just shafts. 10mm and 10mm to 8mm once they are made. 200 10/8mm will be made and 0nly 50 used if the GB goes well. 

as for EU customer, if shipped to the Brussels guy, you only need to pay postage from him to you. arranged once he has your stuff. 

we can add some 10mm shaft but would like to hit our minimum in the 8mm so the shafts can be made for future orders.

160kv isn't set in stone, im sure 140kv isn't that much harder or expensive to do. 

any export or import fees and shipping is included in the individual cost. so EU customers everything is paid to get the motors to Brussels 

other than USA and EU shipping and declarations will be appropriate for your countries extortion fees (low) 

We are aware of the Maytech return policy. We don't handle issues with these products the same way. If there is an issue with a motor or controller we try to exchange (if in stock) or handle any returns personally so we know its taken care of. sometimes the process is longer than expected. Production times and factory stock has played a part in the delays. 

Out of the last Group buy we had 6 motors with issues and to date all but one has been replaced. the last one will be replaced this next week. 
We replace these defective motors from our own stock or out-of-pocket until the damaged one is repaired. This can be dangerous because not everyone will send the return motor in and we will lose that money. We don't want to lose money but rather we do than our customers. 

To those customers with damaged motors please send them in so we can repair or replaced, thank you.

At the moment nothing is set in stone.

If Maytech will do 160kv at that price I can't see it being that much more for 140kv. I only have to ask. Now I guess anyone can do this (a Group Buy) and if someone else wants to do it please say so. Other minimums must be met to get these motors, if your willing to meet those then, please.....

I think we have worked out the major details in the process, lead times and shipping. Time gathering everyone is the killer and moving on a motor that everyone likes even more so. We will take 10-15 ourselves so it's really doable as long as we stick to the same motor and hit our 50 units.

so 140kv, and silicone phase wires.

Leight of wires

look for the E-toxx matrix helical package GB tread soon, I just finalized the prices on the Matrix helical package with Jens and will put that together tonight. 

This will be a hell of a deal on these drives. A set of helical gears, truck extensions and top blocks that would total $973 (860 euro) before shipping you can get for $700 (620 euro) in the group buy.

Details will be in the post for the E-toxx GB

Let me tell you these 6880s will just fit nice with an eToxx drive 1:6.25 with truck extenders on MBS, stance is very wide mind so in this application it doesn‚Äôt matter much or at all

A Turnigy 6374 just has about 6mm clearance, from the spec sheet all is good afaik

I thought you might be @Eboosted,  I thought you might stumble upon this too. 

Update

140$ each plus shipping, USPS flat rate charges for the USA, EU will go through Belgium ( responsible for shipping from Belgium to the receiver, no duties or taxes only post) and the rest of the world will be UPS or DHL the most competitive rate of the two.  

 I will have everything worked out as far as specs Sunday night. We have a window at the factory to get these produced fast and it will make it easy to do future batches of the 8mm shafts even faster. 

The goal is to hit 50 of the 6880 in the so far community consensus 140KV  with  16inch/410mm phase wires (silicone 12g or 14g) and sensor wire 20inch/510mm w/2.0mm JST connector.

No logo?, Its free and could be something to represent the community?

Phase wire size? 12g or 14g??

I have had both requested 140kv and 160kv 

I just can't see much difference in cost from one to the other, the big thing was the 8mm shafts. I may be able to get both custom KVs if we hit our mark. I will also ask about a slit order of 140kv/160kv

never hurts to ask.........

Hey mate :star_struck: !! **How did you do that !???**

You got an extender and still use self-locking bolt ??  
How can you use Fivestar with the shorter entender for Rockstar ??? :yum:   
When I ordered mine last year, it was to set 9" too, but Jens told me it wasn't made for, and Fivestar will not work...   
I was looking for Megastar just to make it work, but I would prefer the lighter and cheaper Fivestar I already got !!!

Can you run a larger motor gear to give same top speed? You will get better gear mesh and same torque if you can.

Standard Bergmeister wheel pullies are usually 60T, motor pulley is normally 15T, most people are using 12S these days, the diameter of Bergmeisters is 150mm

That being said, I wonder why you are choosing 140KV motor which would only give you 37km/hr (23mph). A 200kv motor should be perfect for 33mph
```

## \#42 Posted by: lrdesigns Posted at: 2019-04-15T01:01:51.035Z Reads: 122

Ok but 140kv naturally has more torque than a 200kv, if geared to the same top speed the wheel torque should be roughly equivalent for both setups. 

So the lower kv motor is an advantage as you can use a 20t motor gear instead of a 15t, which will give much better pulley life and less chance of slipping under hard braking. 

15t 140kv 36.8 kph

![image|548x500](upload://cZIEHtFJTytSFuY9VsjEaSkP8Ev.png) 

20t 140kv 49 kph

![image|589x500](upload://1mojEZU3GPR18pAu15Wjx0x4Qe2.png) 

15t 200kv, ok its a bit faster. 52.5 kph

![image|596x500](upload://b1KcPsVfdmO0XGiDzfXedQhXiEP.png) 

Maybe a 140kv 22t ? 53.9 kph Bit less common than 20t I guess. 

![image|586x500](upload://xOqVLJM7KIPU24xWcWzod6DIs9T.png) 


I would much prefer lower kv and larger motor pulley given the option. 

Higher kv motors I think are only better if you need maximum wattage as they have thicker windings.

```
Getting anything more than 16T is not that common, as in difficult-to-get because they aren't standard, yes you might get 20T, 22T pullies but never as easy to get and cheaper than regular 15T pulleys, remember you are also increasing weight and rotational weight is a big factor in acceleration and braking that's why lightweight flywheels help with acceleration in the car would where I come from. 

On the other hand you have thicker windings but that doesn't mean you have more copper, you can get more winding count and the same ammount of copper.

There's a pretty nice technical article around here where torque was compared between two different kv motors with similar weight of copper and torque difference was negligible

The 140kV is coming from us, who want to use them for our mtb. Torque is more important than speed in our case. That‚Äôs why we asked for this low kV.

Maybe to add here that gearing with 190-200kV wouldn‚Äôt work as we as well need clearance. Looking on a belt drive a 72th wheel pulley is already pretty low to the ground on 8‚Äú and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go below 15th motor pulley as well. Maybe ok with idlers but as I don‚Äôt have them üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So 1/4.8 on 190+ kV in this case wouldn‚Äôt really rock the boat üòÖ

Ok,

 I have an Update on the Currently forming GB for 6880 motors and the Etoxx drive. If you scroll up to post 33 You will see where I was reminded that a level 3 or above member can DO group buys. At first, I thought he was simply pointing out that NOT anyone can DO GB on the forum. Well he was not, he was eluding to the fact that I do not meet the criteria for this Level 3 event. 
Now In all fairness, I simply didn't know and it's not easy to determine with the info provided on your own profile stats and the vague requirement description given. 

Now, what did I just say?

We can NOT orchestrate GROUP BUYS on the forum because:

  

Now, What does this Mean? 
I must hurriedly read 218 post or treads? I really don't have the time.  I'm not sure and im not waiting for it to roll over or accumulate to the proper release point for level 3 access. 

What about the Group Buys? 

As far as I can tell it can be done through the Hyperionesk8.com website if properly set up. 

Cory@hyperionsystems.org

Benjamin@hyperionsystems.org

I will post information on the front page of the site with links to the products created for these buys. final specs and options and instructions on how to place the order on the website. 

Because of the Transaction fees from PayPal if used you will need to add 6% if you chose to pay this way. Furthermore, you have the same protection through your card issuing bank and website (Shopify) for fraud and disputes at no extra cost. Please consider this option for payment to save yourself some money. But the choice is yours. 

I will confirm info on motors 6880 on the webpage.

Etoxx helical drive prices 

2 kits to choose from:

Kit 1 

 (raw aluminum) Matrix II Helical drive 10/40 kit 

includes rear truck extenders 

 w/aluminum base plates  $670 shipped 

w/o base plate    $570 shipped

Kit 2

 (raw aluminum) Matrix II Helical drive 10/40 kit 

includes rear truck extenders 

 w/aluminum base plates  $770 shipped 

w/o base plate  $670 shipped

saving up to  $300 off regular price if purchased alone

these prices are solid and our MOR is almost meet. so the more the marrier. This is confirmed by Jens all payments have to be made before anything ships. 
some variants have production times.


Feel free to PM me with questions and I don't see the need to make a fuss over this with the admins, they are following the rules as we all should, I will have more topics to start and some really cool demo builds to showcase for Our MBS eMTB kits and pre-built line. 

I will start a topic specifically about them, prices and options. please look for it. Titled MBS eMTB kits

Thanks, guys It was a misunderstanding and I wasn't aware that I  wasn't level 3, everything is ok and going ahead as planned (tentative)
I have to confirm a few more things maytech. 

the etoxx GB will be posted tonight and the prices are sweet........

I will find out about having two different KVs but I think a middle ground is preferred versus too many variants, 

150kv isn't a bad middle ground for the size of the moto
