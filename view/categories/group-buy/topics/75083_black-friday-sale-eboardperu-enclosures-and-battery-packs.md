I never had any GB or sale on any of my enclosures so If I'm ever gonna do it what a better time than Black Friday.

Here is the deal:

I'm offering US$ 30 coupons on all enclosures and US$ 100 coupons on all battery packs, limited ammount of coupons available.

Enclosure coupon: givemeback30bucks
Battery packs coupon: givemeback100bucks

Coupons will be active from 00:01 Black Friday Night from 23 to 27 of November and deliveries will start in January, just enter the coupon code at checkout.

For a list of enclosures please click [here](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product-category/enclosures/), for a list of batteries click [here](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product-category/battery-packs/)

I'll throw additional US$ 10 coupons for certain enclosures I currently have in USA, but the list will be released during Black Friday sale.

Just wanted to let you know there might be a mistake on the 18‚Äù cruiser enclosure. I think it‚Äôs meant to be 15.2cm and it‚Äôs probably meant to be cm instead as currently it will fit in the palm of me handü§î

How many amps can this pack output at max? What's the size on those nickel strips?

looks like 12s4p 30q so 80A max. double 12 gauge wire is rated for 40A each. seems about right.

Cool I'll put it on my board and pull 100a then. Gotta win that uphill race.

Seriously though, I'm not doubting his ability to build, just wanted to verify the specs.

Just placed an order on a Trampa Enclosure, what are the chances that i could have it shipped out a bit before? Leaving for China and would love to have it before i leave so i can finalize the things in China. 

Thanks.

Hey man, all orders for Black Friday using the discount code are going to be shipped in January, they might ship sooner but I'll depend on the ammount of orders I'll get at the end of the sale.

If i were to pay you the discount i got back would that mean i could get it shipped before?

No. The Unity has a different layout.
