People who filled out the form, but missed out on the first round. Are you still interested?

@zyb

Includes just the heatsink and not the button. Same thing as Hummie but just for Europe

Includes two payments.

Cost of getting it to me in the UK (includes taxes,shipping). This will be paid in USD to the supplier. So it makes sense for you to send me the USD equivalent in your local currency , this can be done easily on Paypal. Goods and services payment.

Shipping cost (from me to you), paid in GBP… This happens when I am ready to ship

Tracked shipping can vary so please let me know if you need tracked shipping.

Untracked parcels are insured up to £20 for untracked.

Thanks moon - hoping you won't mind answering a couple of questions (and anyone else with an opinion!),

So I'm deciding whether to spend an extra £100 - I have a HK SK8 ESC 4.12 - never used as I have not yet finished my battery. I am building my first board, I would like to run it in FOC (I have a sensored motor but want the quietness).

For £92.40 I'd get a FSESC 6.6 which as far as I can tell will be a more futureproof option than my current ESC - is that true? And I can get rid of my Vedder anti-spark and just add a 12v switch directly to the ESC, saving space in my enclosure?

Is this group buy for the FSESC with heat sink and no switch?

Final question - are you based in London? ie could I collect rather than trusting Royal Fail?

Hi, not yet since I need to get 20 units which is going to be hard to reach.

I think I'm going to hold off for now - I haven't built mine yet so think spending more money before I know that I need it is probably a bit OTT.

Thanks for letting me know about it though - how many units do you need to make this go ahead? I'm still hoping I won't regret it.

Great! I'll keep a close watch on this thread and my email.

Well, I have seen some people trying it but no finished builds yet that I have seen. Might be a bit ambitious for my first project, but I figured that a good quality VESC can always be used on another build as well.

And i guess UK delivery is usually 2-3 max so not too bad. Since some European deliveries take up to 2 weeks.

I’m welding up a 12s4p with nickel to copper busbars, working on the p group prototype still.... it’s to go in the hummie deck I’ve got on order with @bigben. The major holdup is no welder yet!! 

On the esc front, can we specify heatsink not case?

Ok guys, this might fall through since I really don't think I am able to risk so many packages again. Like if I send a package gets lost and the insurance is only covering a little bit. I am totally screwed

Sorry my english is lacking a bit here,  but you are not going through with this anymore? Should I start looking for an alternative way to get an esc?

I've always regarded the risk of this to be on my side, wouldn't be able to make a claim through PayPal anyways I think (wouldn'teven if I could)?

Hope I don't come of as rude here, really not my intention! Just want to get a clarification:)

No Nothing got lost I thought someone else's could of been and so I tagged you to ask if maybe you lost a parcel since... You live in Russia. Wanted a quick question that does not gloom around, nobody lost anything here he just worried it could happen (again) because it happened before

ah ok, than all is good.
I usally ask for tracked delivery only.
I literally have problems with all my packs.
Always good to know where it got stuck and where to call or where to go to get my things.
Till now nothing got losted and I order a lot of things also from china.
But sometimes it´s a real torture... 
It very much depent on the carrier how the import and preccessing is handled as far as I can say from my experience.

I only got a refund for the shipping and partial payment.

Tho I gotta say paying in USD for you to get pounds (my bad there),  And then paying the invoice in Dollars (shipping + my balance due to the usd to pounds to usd thing) and now having to change that back to euro is going to sting :sweat_smile: But hey were all in it together!

We did some charity work for the banks :joy:
