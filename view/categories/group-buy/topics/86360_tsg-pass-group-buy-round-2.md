You guys wanted another GB for the TSG Pass helmets so here it is! The helmets are in stock at the distributor, so everything will be able to ship to you in 2-3 weeks. Hopefully we can get at least 6 of each size. 

The Pass is pretty much the standard full face helmet for esk8. Designed with aerodynamics and rider comfort in mind, it has a wide viewing area, featherlight construction, breathable vent ports, and an organic feel while tucking. It includes 2 visors for night and day (they swap in seconds!)

The price is $219.99 shipped in the USA! International shipping is ~$33.

There are also other items available as well! The superlight and basic protection set:

I am closing off the orders on Sunday March 10th at 10am EST

If you have any questions let me know! If you could share this around to get your buddies riding safe it would be greatly appreciated

If theres import tax into the EU, its significantly cheaper to buy from a vendor here already :(

I can definitley help on customs charges, but if the price + shipping is comparable to a local dealer its not worth the risk of them damaging in transit internationally.

It will calculate the shipping cost at checkout (or in the cart page). You can also change the currency to AUS at the top right of the website

So I purchased one right before the GB and it came in today.  I measured my head and it was 22" so I ordered a medium and I get that I don't want it loose but I think it might be too tight.  It is snug on the cheeks which is fine, but it's very snug all the way around. Not too uncomfortable after wearing it for 15 minutes but taking it off it feels like I would get a headache if I wear it too much.  Thoughts? 

I am thinking of returning it and getting a large with the GB

```
Depending on age, if you will grow at all I would go a size up. The helmet gets more comfortable as it conforms to your head, but it can only do that so much. You at the low medium size range, are you sure your head was measured properly?

Yeah I just did again.. right above the eyebrows, largest part, maybe 22-1/4 freedom units.  I can see that if it conforms a little bit it probably will give me a little blood flow.  Thanks!
