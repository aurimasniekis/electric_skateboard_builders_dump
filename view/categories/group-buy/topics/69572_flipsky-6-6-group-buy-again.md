im just doing the single 6.6 for the group buy as it gets too confusing.    the dual...its not much of a deal at wholesale and the single is a better deal.

with shipping it shows at 170$ minimum each 6.6 including the slowest shipping so going with the group buy can save about 50$ and im guessing probably faster.

```
after the last group buy and the other threads here related to the 6.6 I feel its safe to say yes they're good.    They also were talking to Vedder and getting his advice.  As far as I know he only had good things to say about it.   He was emphatic about using 3 shunts for sensing and the 6.6 has 3.   the 4.2 only has 2.   Looking at threads here about the 4.2 on the other hand it doesn't show so well

Hi,
I'm new to the forum and interested in this group buy, but I have two (maybe self-evident) questions. First, do I PayPal first and then add myself to the google doc? And second, since this is similar to the last group buy, I just want to confirm the fsesc here. @Hummie, could you confirm the plan is to GB the one in the link above or will it be the one with the built-in anti-spark switch (like from the other GB)?
Thanks in advance
```

I think they said any that was 12v or above would work.  and I think it has to be a momentary switch too right?

If it works with momentary switch that would be awesome.
With that in mind, I think that with FLIPSKY 6.6 auto shutdown can be implemented.
Can you guys confirm that momentary switch is being used?
Thank you.

Can I get one with the momentary switch at extra cost?
This way it will be plug and play.
I wouldn't use a capacitive touch sensor switch. One drop of water can produce a big problem I think.

$120 for single 6.6 with antispark
$100 for single 6.6 without antispark. 
These prices seems good to me. If I do a GB you will only save a couple dollars from shipping. Take them now from flipsky or I'll start a groupbuy after next week when y'all spend all you money on Black Friday and Cyber Monday deal.

but as this switch is anyhow sh*** and wasn´t included in the last GB, the simplify version seems to be the better choice.

YEh I tested, I removed the bridge and made the switch. Now can be my switch but basically it works but it's like it takes 3 times longer to turn on the vesc and now sure the vesc actually reboot completely. So I am still using a normal antispark switch. I know @mackann was using it with his 4WD monster.

what type of switch are you using? the push button or flip switch? also if you are using the push button did you wire it up exactly to their diagram with a 1k resistor?

## \#61 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2018-11-28T09:20:08.017Z Reads: 81

```
24V rated push button, yeh I followed their diagram, but I use 2K resistor because I though that it's better since they suggest to get the 5V from both of the vesc and I have dueal set up. (didn't try with 5V from just one vesc, should be better in my mind). Maybe the 2K resistor is the reason why it slows down the reboot. I though the resistor is there for the led light, but I can be wrong.

I looked it up. simplified version has the exact footprint as the regular just without the 3 FET switches on the PCB and XT90 is soldered directly onto the pcb. 

The price difference offered to us is only $5. Since the simplified version is already on sale. there would not be a lot of saving on those. 

The current condition with the warranty is that each unit will have a warranty card, and if there's a DOA unit you can send it in for replacement within 7 days of receiving shipment. I need her to clarify if it's 7 days after I receive it or 7 days after you guys receive it given that I can provide shipping info for @BarbaraZ. 

I proposed to test the units when I received them but she is not very keen on that. so basically warranty is treated as regular customer.

https://flipsky.net/pages/after-sale-policy

MOQ is still at 10 units.

Edit: she just replied to me that it's 7 days after you received the units and option for 10 gauge wire on the battery terminal is possible.

[poll type=regular]
* XT-90 on 6.6
* 10 Gauge wire

The build in eswitch did brake after a few days on all 4 single vesc, according to flipsky it was because I connected the battery without the button connected. Bought their antispark, did brake after first try, their anti spark switch don't work on 12s and 6.6, only 12s and vesc 4 or 10s and 6.6..
Ended with another antispark for them
