As the sensor plug is already a 2mm JST, wouldn´t it make sense to ask for 10cm longer sensor wires (or 10cm shorter phase wires) to compansate the phase wire lenght comming from the esc?

Would international orders have to pay taxes?

Edit 2: Most likely in for 2 motors depending on tax.

Edit: Does someone have a picture of the actual motor? And just to confirm, it’s not [this](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html), right?

If I’m correct the one with 30mm shaft don’t have a hole for a keyway.

I add „sensored“ to the title to make it a bit more clear, I hope. I‘m not the OP so better @barajabali will answer your question, but the motors should come with a slot for keyway as I understood.
Just this time it will be only 30mm shaft instead of 40mm like last time.

Oh, I am interested. However it depends on 2 things.
1. Customs charges (if @barajabali can declare a really low value on the parcel, then this would likely not be a problem)
2. How do they compare with other motors? (eg I am not impressed with the power of SK8 motors)

Glad someone else wants to organize a group buy for them. My experience from a local group buy I participated in was 10 minimum order and any size/kv we wanted, with keyways. I'm curious if you have a different supplier.

Or do you think it would be possible to get some with a keyway slot?

Just grind a flatspot and use the grub screw. I can even grind the flatspot for you if you want.
I just dont do keyways because theyre not standardized. All motors and pulleys use a different size so its almost pointless.

Interesting motors especially with sensors. Did anyone ever opened this motor?

I'm just curious if there is any difference to SK8 beside the closed can and motorplate, I'm pretty sure it's from the same manufacture.

Here is how the SK8 looks (not my pic, can't remember who posted it)

No grub screws or keys needed, it holds really well. It was designed for this very purpose.

Just did some math.

The hanger is 218mm and the motors are 170mm in total. Then there is 48mm remaining for space between the motors and mounts. 4mm space between the motors and then there is 22 back for the mounts.

Should be possible, I believe :grimacing:

Same here, I think the problem with everyone that goes from sensors to sensorless is they think it will just start normally if they only pull the throttle a little like they would when using sensored motors. When using sensorless I’ve found if I just give the throttle a little pull from a stop it starts up nicely and I don’t even need to push, this is the same for hills. I can go up some pretty darn steep hills from a stop like this too

I wonder if epoxying the PCB, Halls and windings and adding a stealthy 'filter' net to the air intake would be sort of 'investment' for the longevity of the motors. I read guys at efoil-builders do that for their watercooled 6374s. I pipe-dream one day making an efoil as well with the battarias, escs and motors already on hand:P This epoxying+filter would allow to ride in rain and thru water then aswell if the board takes it.

The motor won’t fit my build since it’s gear drive. I think the motors will hit the base plate when turning.

He said though, that I could buy the FatBoy 230 hanger and then they would fit. I already got trucks ordered, so I don’t think I’ll get them...

I think it might work for you, though. Since the motors will be further away from the base plate with belt drive, it shouldn’t hit it when turning.

Hope this group buy will succeed :slight_smile:

If everyone who committed, pays asap (i've pm'ed you all who need to pay) I will place the order the same day and just buy the difference to meet the MOQ myself. Should be something like 10 motors. Ill keep a lot of them, then just sell of the rest.

It looks like this will be the final tally

(8) 150 kv

(4) 170 kv

(13) 190 kv (most of these are unsold)

@MasterSpoon @xsynatic yes you can add hall sensors to sensorless motors. APS sold the pcbs, but they out of stock for 63mm motors. Might just need to write them a mail and ask about it.
https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/50mm/internal-pcb-with-hall-effect-sensors-120-degree/

If a outrunner is to tight inside for to add hall sensors, there are pcb boards to mout them outside. just have a short search in here and you will find what you need.
It would be something like this
http://e0designs.com/products/hall-effect-sensor-board/

One thing to be aware, get the right size board. Not all motors with 63mm are really 63mm. I think the sk3 is more slim as well.

Last option would be to use and AS5947 encoder instead of hall sensors. That would be even more precise than hall sensors.
```

@Andy87 Any idea what sensor boards the factory is using in these ? I have looked through this thread and the last one but doesn't look like anybody has been kind enough to pull one apart and show the sensor circuit.

@barajabali any chance the factory will sell you the sensor circuits so we can retrofit to Sk3 motors we already have ? or any chance you can pull one apart and take some photos of how the factory has implemented the sensors ?

Hey if anyone wants 2 of my 190KV motors I’ll sell my spot.

Had a loose magnet and needed new motors ASAP so I am getting in touch with my dude @marcmt88 to get some new ones as soon as I get home. He ships super fast.

If no one wants them now, I’ll make a separate post and sell em later for $110 each w/ free US shipping after I receive them.

Idk why but the dumb forum isn’t letting me post this message w/o additional text since I just sent it as a private message so I’m entering more text here.

Aware. I'm only asking for an ETA given that I originally asked if they would arrive for the 20th June for my own logistics and he said they should. 

"En route' tells me absolutely nothing so I'd like to know where in the world they are so I can figure it out for myself. It is not a crisis if they don't arrive on time, but I think it's only right that I get a straight answer to the question.

I actually wish Marcmt would make them slightly longer so you could elevate them from the floor a bit, especially given that they're designed for that specific truck.

But anyway, don't want to derail the thread...

Assuming they ride as good as they look, I may be in for 2 more for my other board.

Bit late now mate.

If there's an inherent error with how close the motor rides to the base plate why isn't it longer as standard?

He sells a pre-built drivetrain with 2 6374s, same issue. Ask me how I know.

EDIT: In fact I'll just throw this up so no one else makes the same mistake....and don't get me started on the motors....

No, the motor has to run so close to the baseplate corner it scuffs the edge of it in the turn..even with a 96a duro double barrel. This is on his 890 dollar pre-built drivetrain, so I feel like if the error is present there he should already be well aware of it. I don't feel like I should have to ask specifically for him to correct it as Winfly suggested. I've learned to live with the problem anyway (I bought a second set, afterall!)  

I quite the skid plate - might have to steal that idea.

The motors themselves are quite poor, that's what I was getting at. I had to buy a replacement as the sensor board failed on the first ride, then it started making weird noises on startup. Now another one of them is making a large electric "THHHWWWAAANNNHGGG" sound at a specific RPM. I've read somewhere that it's the magnet but I can't find the post now.

I'm aware, I already do on my other build. I have to pick every line so that I don't ride any bumps. Thankfully I live in Sweden where the roads and cycle paths are super smooth (for the most part) 

Maybe it's time for @marcmt88 to jump in and explain why he made them this short? And further, offer to replace them to longer ones that are actually fit for purpose?

@mikenopolis I personally like motor plates that are as short as possible so they have always worked great for me.  Its mostly an aesthetics thing as I mount them in reverse, but if I were to choose to mount them under the deck I would want them as short as possible so they don't hit my enclosure as my enclosure takes up most of the room under my deck

I have found the cnc'ed idler pulleys to be a bit odd though.  There is nothing preventing them from rubbing against the motor plate for either the delrin or the full aluminum ones.  I immediately replaced them by just using 2 or 3 bearings stacked side by side instead.  I got the bearings from Allied Electronics for cheap!

Honestly, I wish he would charge an extra few bucks and just include extra bearings to use as idlers instead of the pulleys he machines.  I paid about $3-4 a bearing to get ones that were the right size.  They are 5mm wide, but I just center two of them them using washers so they are right in the middle of a 12 mm belts and it has worked flawlessly for hundreds of miles.

Yeah those idlers don't work at all. I tried using washers so they didn't rub on the motor plate but didn't work either. I have four fabulous grooves in my plates from where they became high power drills during my first 10 min ride. I also switched to a true bearing idler, which has been problem free.

Again, I shouldn't have to do this. They're motor plates, they should be bolt on and go. I've emailed him about the fit issue so we'll see what he says.

I don’t think so. May sell them in my store but for more of a markup. Had someone not receive it and the refund hurt lol

Hey everyone!

I got two of the 150kv I won't be needing anymore, therefore i'm selling them. They are currently at Bara, so they'll be shipped straight from him (the US).

Price for both is $230 shipped in the US & internationally. Only splitting if there is a buyer for both :slight_smile: 

@ZackoryCramer you were looking for some, right? 

Hit me up if you're interested and we'll figure it out :slight_smile:

Have a lovely day everyone!

Thanks for letting me know, Any chance they will accept to sell you 2 with free shipping to make good on their mistake?
