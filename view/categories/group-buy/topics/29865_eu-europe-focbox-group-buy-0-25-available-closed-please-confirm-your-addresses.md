**EU FOCBOX Group Buy**

There are 25 slots available for shiney new FOCBOXES.

Price: ¬£98.45 + VAT + delivery.

There is a chance to save on the VAT if you purchase through an EU VAT registered company. If you can provide a valid VAT I will not need to charge VAT, or you can always claim the VAT amount back in the normal way.

Example of all in costs for a single FOCBOX order:

1 x FOCBOX				¬£98.45
VAT (20%)				¬£19.69

SUB TOTAL				¬£118.14

PayPal Fee (3.4% + ¬£0.20)	¬£4.22
	
TOTAL					¬£122.36


Delivery				         ¬£7
(approximate delivery cost, will vary slightly between countries)


I am based in the UK, so I will be sending out the packages from here once they land which should mean nice and quick delivery times for everyone.

* PayPal to be used for payment, please DO NOT use friends and family payments, it makes more sense to pay the extra 3.4% + ¬£0.20 PayPal fee for your own protection
* Items will be send via the UK Royal Mail, signed for service
* All GB members must have paid for their items before the Group Buy order of FOCBOXes will be placed.

I'm in with two FOC's

and i guess you order from Enertion directly, so would it be possible to add a Nano remote to the order ?

Or mybe even a Focbox/Nano-remote Groupbuy combined ?

AFAIK the warranty is 60 days from time of purchase. If a unit dies in that time I guess you could send it to me and I will send it to Enertion for replacement.

@onloop - is that something Enertion would be happy with?

What about premium warranty? Covers user inflicted damage also - 1 year and I think you had 50% off when buying Focbox at the same time.... would you look into this also ? As an option- would be cool to have one.

@MontPierre Great question, thanks for asking.

Good news! The Enertion extended warranty is available (to purchase) for members of the this Group Buy.

* People who wish to purchase extended warranty will be able to do so by purchasing the 1yr FOCBOX Replacement warranty as a separate product using their own account. 
* If they buy these before your products have been shipped, they will be eligible for the 50% discount off the price of the Replacement warranty. 
* If they choose to buy it later, it would be at the full price.

Great news! Thank you for checking ! 

I understand that buyer covers shipping cost to Enertion in case of warranty claim - what about shipping back to buyer after FocBox was fixed? Is it his cost as well or Enertion?
```

## \#13 Posted by: DavidBanner Posted at: 2017-08-08T11:16:51.105Z Reads: 163

```
@MontPierre here is the answer straight from the horses' mouth (or the Enertion website in this case):

"Shipping costs are not covered under the warranty all shipping costs are the responsibility of the claimant." <- this is the standard T&C for warranty repairs.

"does not cover shipping charges of replacement" <- from the Extended Warranty page
```

Cool. Now I'll calculate shipping to Australia - both ways and see if its not close to price of FocBox including extended warranty :) i have a feeling it will be very close. I wonder if there would be VAT added to FocBox on the way back for Entertion - most probably yes :confused:

Shouldn't be any VAT issues, but that would be something you need to confirm for sure. 

I know commercial samples, stuff for review is exempt, I've had some seriously expensive bits of audio equipment coming in and out of the country for reviews without getting hit with duty and VAT.

I guess market for esk8 is much smaller in UK. Shame. Well I'll monitor the progress and jump in with the payment before we reach 25 - just short on cash atm :/ as I just bought FocBox - my Maytech Vesc got fried on 2nd day of my board running. 

Second one will be for my dual mountain wheeled longboard. Also waiting for @trampa to get their new long trucks in stock and new 7 inch tyres :D

If I recall correctly I think he said in the thread the plan was to go to the USA and grab em, put them in his suitcase on the way back. 

Of course legally you need to declare this and pay the VAT, if not you are smuggling. If you get caught at the airport the very least you will face is having the goods seized and a fine.

> cause he managed to get them nearly 20‚Ç¨ cheaper per piece ?

‚Ç¨20 is very close to the current EU VAT rate :slight_smile: on a FOCBOX

I am purchasing through my UK company and will pay the VAT on import, I then need to add VAT on each order and pay that to the govt or they come and get me in the middle of the night and poke me with sharp sticks :slight_smile: (actually that would probably be much better than what they would really do if I were to be silly and get caught, they do not take VAT fraud lightly)

But yes anyone with a VAT registered EU company can buy the FOCBOXes and claim the VAT back or not pay the VAT in the first place. I am guessing there are a few folks out there with companies that need FOCBOXes for R&D or transportation purposes.

@jarzombeg that is really hard to say for sure because shipping can have delays, customs clearance sometimes takes longer than normal etc etc.

But here is my "best guess" of how long it will take if everything goes smoothly.

Day 1 - Order Placed
Day 8 - Order Received in the UK by me
Day 10 - Orders Sent out to Group Buy Members
Day 13 - 17 - Orders received by GB members


Of course the shipping to the UK may be quicker and I will do my best to get the orders packaged and sent the next day so could be sooner than that if we get lucky.

BTW, there might be a fee from courier company for taking the VAT payment. Not sure if that's calculated in. If not we can all chip in later but actually it should be fixed fee,  not depending on VAT amount. I think round ¬£10-¬£20? Depends on carrier enertion will use.

a quick message folks - don't want to overtake this thread. I've been riding few days on 10S3P FOC a FOCBOX. It actually works really well as a replacement for one of my VESC 4.12 - for an electric skateboard and seem to handle pretty well all the hard times I'm giving it.

IMPORTANT:

* I have assumed everyone is in the EU for postage reasons, please let me know via PM if you are in the UK and need postage - the two postage rates are on the spreadsheet.
* Please check your order details for errors and let me know so I can correct anything that is wrong

PayPal
* When making payment PLEASE ADD YOUR eSK8.builders USERNAME IN THE COMMENTS and ensure your address is correct.
* I have calculated and added on the PayPal fees, using friends and family means you are not protected.

Sons of leeches in PayBurglar actually charged me some 3% for something, some 10‚Ç¨, just for the transaction? <:7 heck knows!

Did they at least have the decency to put on a mask and hold a gun at your head?

I just checked, there should be no import duty, VAT is only 25% (i.e. about $57). Where does the rest of the charge come from? Let me guess they added a "handling fee"?
