Hey there,

so for the next 13h there is a sale on [these popular motors](products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv?utm_campaign=03212018+%24169+Single+Motor+Mechanical+Kit+%28MXVVmF%29&utm_medium=email&_ke=Z3VzdGF2LnZvaWd0c0BnbWFpbC5jb20%3D&utm_source=11.23.2017+Drip.Co+2386).
![c6474625967d152fff6f55c637b213b9_2000x|460x306](upload://hC61VasI4Q6qDlpSUpF9NcIerSl.jpg)

With the voucher code '20OFF6355190KV' they are selling for 70USD. 
If we get over 400€ worth of any orders together, diy offers free worldwide shipping so this might be a good opportunity for a quick group buy.

Edit: I was just told that using this Voucher will keep us from getting free shipping :confused: this means that a total of 40$ shipping will also be split among participants. 

EU import duties should be around 22% so **I can relay them to you for around 70€ plus shipping and paypal**. Same 22% fees apply for any other (not too bulky) diyelectric product.

As I said, this order would need to happen today, so please let me know if there is any interest!

|Item|€uros|
|---|---|
|TB 6355 190kv including 22% import duties|70
|Diyelectric shipping|35 / number of participants|
|German shipping tracked|6|
|EU shipping tracked|9|
|___________________________________||
|Paypal Fee in case of G&S|3%|
|Any other item|Do the math|


BTW... they still have 15mm Motor Pulleys for 15USD. Just not listed atm.
Not earning money on this - any unexpected changes to the ammounts will be charged/refunded.

Are these motors any good?

They're fine. Just use them and replace should they break.

Oh you mean TB Vescs are no good? Yes there are better ones. These ones from TB are cheap and work fine without FOC and below 12s I guess.

TB’s products are proven to be good quality except on-off switch. Most of faults are IMO user errors.

You can put them on any mount of your choice but I think this GB is not going through since theres too little interest.
