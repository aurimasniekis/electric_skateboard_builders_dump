Nice Jason! 

Thanks! 

Despite how awesome this is, a bit sad to not see 15mm wide, but still... that'd be asking too much if they never existed to begin with. Lots of 12mm builds out there and I'm sure this will be put to good use. I hope so at least üòÅ these look fresh!

do people actually need 15mm wide... ?  Maybe on mono drive?

12mm was always uber reliable for me.

Realistically? Probably not. I just have gallons of 15mm belts exclusively. Now that I think about it, buying new belts is hardly an issue.

How bad is it to use 2 thin belts on the same pulley?  Say you move from 9mm to 15mm so you use a 9mm and 6mm belt

No two belts are created equal my friend.  One would be too tight and the other too loose.  Thinking outside the box though like it.

I think that 15mm is actually by far the most common now. I think the belts are much easier to find/buy too.

9mm is almost nonexistent on builds now days.

9mm mold could easily be modified to make it 15mm wide. Probably cost about $1500 to modify the mold.

That's great. I think 15mm with the bearings would be our bread and butter. 

15mm pulleys would also work with 9mm and 12mm belts just fine if needed. Will also help to narrow this down to 1 part, which I think will help get a higher quantity group buy. 

If we can get these down to a reasonable price they would be the go to option for a lot of builds

That's a really great price but I believe this will be extremely difficult to achieve unfortunately. A forum member organizing a 5k 1000 delivery group buy in a community with 500ish really active users across 50 countries?

Especially because 15mm 40t appears to be the current standard, going on recent builds. Most people are using big ol' wheels now.

Is there flex on MOQ's? If not I would suggest that allowing vendors to buy large stacks would be the only way this can come to any sort of real fruition.

4k or 5k inst much money to some people, its a lot for others.... & these don't have shelf life.... 

anyway... the MOQ could be much less.  maybe 500... somebody needs to investigate it.

Are these molds locked into that specific manufacturer?

If other facilities could run the mold then you can get MUCH lower MOQ's. I know protolabs (in the US) has an MOQ of 25.

I've been quoted prices sub 4$ at 25 parts.

I don't think pressure is an issue but they definitely need to match the plastic due to temperature warping compensation in the mold.

They have a shelf-life -- in that these are old technology, don't have enough teeth, aren't 15mm wide, aren't metal, and don't fit kegel cores....hence they are less valuable in 2019 than they were back in the day, and much more difficult to sell.  So even though they may not spoil and become rancid sitting on a shelf, they still become less and less valuable as time passes, and eventually become unsellable inventory as current standard and practices evolve.

I think the biggest killer is that abec11 is essentially dead on the development side. No new wheels, limited color selection, limited availability, sub-par quality.

The grass truly is greener in regards to kegel cores.

I think that there is no longer a "premium" market for these anymore, there are definitely nicer pulleys for sale now. BUT I think its definitely a good inbetweener for budget boards or even anyone just trying to save a few bucks on their build.

If you could get two pulleys with bearings for $20(or even less apparently) I think there's for sure a market there. I think these are nicer than the cheapo universal no bearing pulleys(have fun aligning those) you can find on ebay and such. Not everyone is building $2000 boards. 

Plus, I love having backup parts and at that price you could just keep an extra in your riding tool kit.

So employ someone to make wheels. Chris isnt abec. This is a really silly statement people keep making.

Yes... Chris is Abec11. Abec11 is literally a one man operation in case you didn't know. It is not because a company look big that it is actually big.

I fully understand that is the case at the moment. I'm suggesting change and that abec is a brand now that doesn't need Chris' name attached to each action. ABEC doesn't need to cease operation because Chris is going though some stuff, he's a respected gent and I doubt anyone would mind if he let's someone take the reigns for a bit while he sorts things out.

That is kind of an arse thinking, do you even know what is going with Chris life... Or do you care? I know want your wheel, but I will honest there things in life that are far more important than wheel. 

I'm Sorry, but you can't judge someone else action, without knowing anything about them or their life.

A fully functional 12mm pulleys regardless of tooth count is absolutely valuable at 5 bucks a piece. There are so many builders that start out using 32 or 36 tooth pulleys, this would save a new builder a substantial amount. That's just one instance where they are valuable.

I think you have my intentions mixed up here. I want abec11 to be around in 2 years, choice is great. No I don't know what Chris is going through and I've not gone out my way to find out because it's clearly personal and none of my business.

You're right though, it's ultimately his decision of course. I'm suggesting that it's not 2010 and there are some serious competitors on the market now. If Chris wants/is able to return he'll need a market to return to right? If he wants to pack it in he's welcome to do that as well.

Please don't mix my business direction messages up with a lack of compassion. While I hope Chris can get back to it asap I still don't see the need for his company to be left behind, it seems mad after all the work that went in to building it.
