Found a source for these! Could get a set (4 x tires, tube, hubs) for $100 (or less)  for a groupbuy!

Tires are 6" x 2" similar to @psychotiller  [awesome wheels](http://psychotiller.com/product/6-billet-wheel-hubs) but much much cheaper (in price and probably quality :sweat_smile:) 
Hubs have 3x bolts I will design a 3d printed htd5 60t pulley to go with them $15-20 each.

Make sure they can handle the pressure needed! Pneumatics need to be able to handle pressures up to 60-70psi, so roll resistance is limited. Otherwise you waste a lot of energy on friction.

lol I'm sure these cannot hold that kind of pressure! But hopefully they have acceptable rolling resistance for the price.

High psi is not the only way to smooth rolling wheels. 
These are the holy grail to me.

Are they longboard truck compatible? The skike ones for example are wider (34mm instead of the needed 24mm if I remember correctly) and need to be lathed down to fit a normal axle.

It is not real friction but tire hysteresis that eats up all the energy.

Still working to get all the details.
You can see this board is using rkp trucks. 
It looks like hubs have some sort of adaptor to fit standard truck axles.

I think the small diameter and wide thread should help with rolling resistance.

yeah an axle extender would make sense.
rolling resistance is a b!7ch though - on my 5" skikes I basically need double the amount of energy per km than on the longboard

In this picture, they only have one bearing in the hub...Probably because they couldn't put a nut on the axle with 2 bearings seated properly in the hub.

@saul can you find out whether they fit on a standard longboard truck/axel ? Also, is the rim able to accept other 6x2 tires and tubes? Some of these small-run proprietary sets end up using atypical measurements and then can't accept standard replacements.

Sorry by simplifying. Hysteresis is the correct term. There are also some other effects that effect the roll resistance. It has a lot to do with the tire construction itself and the rubber used. We made some prototype tires reducing the roll resistance to a minimum. No more Steel....half the weight, 85 PSI rated, special rubber. They will not be cheap but they roll like a ninja. We just made the decision to produce them.  

A lot of the cheap tires from China use funky plastics instead of rubber. Usually these are a bit more glossy just like the image shows. They even copied our Trampa Treads Tire down to the detail. Quality is so shocking....

Anyway: Try these 6" tires and see how they perform.  If they perform, great! Hubs won't fit skate trucks.  

Would you like these? 125mm Urethane on Trampa wheels?

wow, I think this thread has turned into something very valuable! I like the big urethane thing wheels.. I assume that is the perfect middle ground between pneumatic tires and street wheels.. 

@saul the ones you showed looks quite interesting.. I wonder how they roll / are constructed, if they are mounted only on one bearing / one side of the hub..  Looks somewhat ok from the pics non the less..

I even wonder if one type of scooter 15mm pulley would fit these hubs perfectly or not.. as the pulley also has 3 screws... will try to give the pic of the pulley once I find it.

We can adapt our wheels to fit all axle diameters ( 8, 9.52,10, 12mm). 
But: Our wheels are slightly to wide to fit a regular Skate hanger (34mm outer side bearing to outer side bearing)
Big wheels like wide Trucks - otherwise wheel bite gets an issue. They perform quite well on the Carveboard. 
The Image was made in 2013! Now I can see an application for them.
I will do some design work next week and send it to the factory. 76a-78a would be nice....
The beauty is: You can use pneumatics and urethane wheels on the same Hub and all of the other gear would also fit.
The slave (wheel) pulley would need to be made to suit the application. No Problem! 44 teeth would be nice.
@Nowind Jens Spur Gear Drive would be nice to apply to them Wheels. I should have a chat with him.
That would be very lush....but expensive I Guess.

@JLabs Wasting 100$ on a set of wheels that does not perform is wrong. These wheels are probably made to fit sack barrows and the rubber quality is probably not good enough for the application because it doesn't need to be superior for the application it was designed for. I have seen many tires, believe me. The square shape points towards low PSI. High PSI inflation rates need a round section profile to handle the pressure. **It states: max inflation 20 PSI!** 
Try them, judge them and then you will see... If they perform, you have found a nice wheel that everyone can buy on alibaba cheaper than anywhere. I doubt it. Those tires are designed to be cheap and run on low PSI.
Tires and hubs are a topic on its own. How well you can inflate them depends on the hub and the tire. I can see that the screws sit very far to the inside, which is not good for high PSI inflation, especially if the hub is casted.

When MTBs came to market, there was very little choice. People were searching for tires and used what they found. You can find some 5 and 6 inch pneumatics these days.
Most of them are not good for the use on skateboards. The Hubs would also need to be made to suit the application. Problem: Invest is not little. A mould for a hub and tire is expensive and you can't buy small quantities. Some of our tires need to be made in batches of 10.000. 
I really like the 7". Its very good for urban use. Maybe a bit to bulky for a longboard but perfect for our street carver. We will soon offer a special, low roll resistance version.
In my opinion the boards and trucks need to be adapted to suit the pneumatic wheels. Such a board is a sort of SUV skateboard. Anyway, we will make the 122mm Gummies for our hubs. They are really nice for e-skates and roll resistance is little. I'll work out a way to fit them to caliber II trucks.

Hi Steve, did you get the long shaft?

Try the pneumatics first! Its such a beautiful feeling to ride on air. 
Untill I get a new quote, contracted the factory and molds are made, production finished, three month will pass by easily. I'll try to sketch up a timeline for the 125mm Urethane. I'm desperate to make this happen fast. The Superstar looks really lush with those tires on. 

The low roll resistance 7 and 8" pneumatic tires are ordered and will go into production now. We have no confirmed estimated time of arrival. Its a 100% fiber banded tire, special rubber etc. Half the weight, mega fast, high PSI rated version.

I haven't been home to receive mail this week, but I'll bet the long shaft is sitting in my mailbox. Thanks, again, for sending it!

Those new tires sound excellent; weight, rolling resistance, and punctures are the main reasons I got the Street Carver, rather than the Urban Carver. The new pneumatic tires seem to address my first two concerns. Will the "fiber bands" improve puncture resistance? A reality of e-boarding in San Francisco is rolling through broken liquor bottles!

I know, lots of rotten people around Mission District. I was amazed how many homeless are around in SF.
Punctures are an issue but high pressure helps. There is a sealant, fixing punctures the second they happen. I once saw that at a fair. The guy had hundreds of nails in a bicycle tire without loosing pressure. 

I would give it a try, carry a spare tube in case you fear punctures. Changing the tube is a 8min job. You will like the comfort of the pneumatic tires. Zero vibrations, off road capable, smooth.

I'm talking with them (at least, I believe them to be the same company).. and I got from them a price list of all the seperate components. One truck from them cost around 20usd but what was more interesting is the battery and the deck. Deck costs 200usd, battery (8.8ah and 11.6ah) - 150 and 225 usd.

On a side note:

Have not seen anyone using these remotes..(!) Trigger looks like it could be finnicky, like the evolve remote users have for their evolve's.

Cheap also but I believe there would be some shipping cost also, besides the item price

i've got a few people signed up for a set, still working to get more.

I saw other parts but they didn't seem worth it. the wheels are only thing that caught my attention. But i've been looking for more options and found these!!

they both need some longer axles, but nothing a dremel couldn't fix.
the smaller 32mm wide wheels are also 65psi and much cheaper, but the wide tread and alu hubs on first are nice! 
downside is these have higher min orders, but I can try for a sample.

Just random searches, years of internet research skills and then I got lucky a bit.
Almost had some nice 5" but they don't make them anymore. 

They quoted me for 500 wheels. Which is crazy. Hopefully I can just get a few sets as a sample.

They are pretty cheap tho. So if I can at least get them down to 100 wheels I think we could reach that.

The original 6" were only 50 min since they were "spares". üòâ

But I think these 6x2s are better. Higher psi. Nicer hub design. Tires from the source!

The thin wheels here are ok.

brake the deal, it is use on kick scooters but no good if hitting 18+ MPH.  Aliendrivesystem use them you can check that. 

The thick one looks promising to me. :-) 
but the hub look suspicious. Maybe too heavy and the availability it is something to have in mind. 

Nonetheless it is a good effort on the look for 6 in wheel.

I know I wanted them, but maybe I can find another source. they 5" x 1".

anyways looks like I can get a sample of the 6" x 2"
They are the same size as the first wheels, 30psi instead of only 20psi.
and the hubs look better quality.

@Bender @caustin @faust @monkey32
Should I move ahead on these?
they will need an extra 10mm on the axles to fit.

At 32mm wide I'm pretty sure that means they will require 18mm spacers once you account for the 2 7mm bearings. 
They therefore won't fit on a standard skate trucks unless you mill out 8mm very accurately so the 22mm diameter bearings sit deeper in the hub. You could potentially do 8mm one side or 4mm each side. I haven't actually seen them so I am making assumptions but unless there is a reason to believe otherwise I would say this is the default assumpyi

I am in the process of trying this with these:

https://der-rollenshop.sportkanzler.de/Powerslide-two-piece-aluminium-air-tire

I have one I'm my hands for testing but I need a very accurate forstner bit or similar to recess the bearings further. I did buy a "22mm" bit but it is too large in diameter to fit in the hub and make the bearing recess deeper. The bearings themselves do fit in the recess though, so i suppose it's actually the cheap forstner bit that is at fault. I am trying to sand it to the correct diameter but it is very hard metal. I may have to buy a more expensive bit and hope the tolerance is closer. 

They also sell the hubs separately for 21.5eur:
https://der-rollenshop.sportkanzler.de/Powerslide-aluminium-rim

They are in 2 pieces bolted together with 3 machine screws which should make attaching a pulley very easy,as well as changing tubes/tyres. 

The price is also very reasonable

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/d/ed087a663df85fad99ac61a47724fb91fe8bb5a2.jpg" width="666" height="500"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/9/39007c2705dd79965ff32f6314cb526962011ec3.jpg" width="666" height="500">
Seems like they could in fact fit a standard truck with the second bearing sitting deep inside the hub. That would also help and make for a wider wheelbase. Shipping is ridiculous though.

Edit: They'll let me know about the bearing to bearing distance tomorrow. Price for a hub is 5USD and tire plus tube is 4USD. Shipping via DHL to Germany would be 60USD however. If the bearing distance makes sense I'd be open to order more if someone wants any in Europe.

Edit2: So they do use a 20mm spacer between bearings which means they won't fit standard trucks without modification :cry:

Edit3: I asked for pictures of the axle without the hub to better understand how long it needs to be to make the hub fit. They sent me this: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/1/8144609b52d41bc637f76cf563e8a40f0e015c1f.jpg" width="666" height="500">

If someone got a stock of them.. would be interesting to perhaps try them out sometime in the future..

Im more concerned about the durability / quality of the rubber tire.. Though It probably should be way better than those skike or cheap AT wheels which are also for sale..

@Maxid do yo by any chance know how much 'ply' these tires got?

I think it is perhaps possible to look up ''Epic boards'' and see if there are any reviews about the tires themselves.

--

Anyways, if the tire can be had for less than 5 eur.. the durability probably isnt the biggest concern.. as these should probably overlast some other small wheels..

Well.. you wont believe but some analogue ''wheelbarrow'' wheels, which usually are a lot larger.. goes for similar or even lower price.. I think I saw some for like 5-8 eur a piece.. and these things are huge/massive..

Anyways.. I suppose this depends on the application very much.. as there is usually the writing on these wheels - not for highspeed use, just not sure what highspeed might mean for these wheels (wheelbarrow ones)

--

I know new / genuine Abec flywheels and some other brands cost close to 100eur to get a set.. and these are not even pneumatics.. but still.. we also got to see how low the price gets when you buy in volume.. so it is just a matter of low-selling products that rise the price so much for these regular mountainboard wheels/hubs etc, I believe..(and longboard, too)

Non the less, I would like to see how these wheels perform as it looks like they could be readily available if someone decided to use them.. and yeah, for that price, for new complete wheel set, it is quite a good price..

 Sorry about my rant here.. :D
I just remember looking at some wheels (dont remember which ones now) and comparing them to bicycle/motorcycle wheels and not getting the idea why do they get so expensive..

I would be a bit careful if the metal walls for the hub is 2mm or so. Someone on ES forum had similar metal hub and the center of it just broke apart.

Non the less, nice find. Though im not sure is that tire inflatable or not (tube), at least i dont know whenever there is or isnt any valve on the other side.

If I still got pictures I will later show what wheel I had found.. the rim/hub was made out of durable plastic but the tire's profile was a bit too wide and big for our needs..

--

@ppamment alibaba's link is quite good.. ( https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Baby-stroller-tyre-175x50_60390333478.html )

 Would be great if there were similar low-volume seller for all types of these tires.. they got some really small ones available.. too bad we dont live in china :D

Perhaps someone can look these up on TaoBao? I think there was a member or two on this forum, who knew chinese or at least knew how to order from TaoBao (if not even lived in Hong Kong or china..)

And .. if they do make evolve tires's now we can speculate at what price they really get them :D (For 4 tires only on Evolve Aus site - 79AUS).. but okay.. that's business and there's probably shipping/import cost on top of that

I meant that if it has a 20mm bearing seat, and all of our wheels usually have a 10mm beating seat, giving us about 7mm for the nut. The only way this wheel would work is if the axle was longer.

But you do see that they also just use a 37mm axle - which is what standard trucks have no?
Where do your 7mm for the nut come from? A skate bearing is 7mm thick - that gives you 7+7+10=24mm for a standard wheel and 13mm for the nut. These ones apparently have 7+7+20 = 34mm leaving only 3mm for the nut and which is why I asked them again how they make it work as apparently something is off here. However we do see that they manage to fit the wheel on there with a 37mm axle (admittedly it is a tight fit for the nut and not much room is left).
The 37mm for a standard truck I got from here - I did not measure my calibers:

What I can see is they posted a picture of their wheels on a truck, but not bolted. Then they showed a picture of a standard truck. Have you seen a picture of that wheel or any of those wheel barrow wheels actually bolted onto a skate truck?

that is because the bearing is recessed and sits deeper inside the Hub. This design puts most of the weight on that one bearing though so it is not perfect. but gives you a wider wheelbase which is nice.

There's no nut.  They just slapped it on there for a picture...the bearing seat is too wide for standard trucks. 
You may be able to put a 20mm threaded sleeve on the axle 
. It would sit between the bearings, so you would have to put a bearing on the axle first then the sleeve, then the wheel , then the outside bearing, then a bolt into the sleeve. The sleeve would also act like a bearing spacer.
Just a thought.TV

There is a nut and you also see how far the bearing is recessed. Don't compare this with the other pictures of the 10mm axles - that is a different hub with the bearing sitting on the outside edge. But again: i asked them how they manage to fit the wheel on there with a 20mm spacer - that can't be true. Let's wait what they say.

There is a second picture from a random alibaba seller:
you can slightly see the bearing's metal rim - because it sits so deep inside the hub

We are both speculating and I say no it is not. There are two different hubs out there and one has the bearing all the way on the outside and the other has it recessed.
this is a completely different hub with 6000 2Rs bearings (outside diameter 26mm and 10mm inside):

Apparently the tire itself was already extensively used on the "early days" all terrain boards with lead batteries:
The Gecco series boards are quite popular on the German esk8 forum and have been used for a couple of years now:

The tires and tubes itself are rather easy to find.. 

https://electricscooterparts.com/tires.html

(they are also on ebay, for about 10usd a piece)

--

What's best? - These hubs fit perfectly with this sort of screw placement, as this cog has:

(@Maxid thanks for sharing that Gecco board)

Though, the hardest part so far, is where to find this cog.. it is 65T, htd5, so it can be ''paired'' with 12 / 15 / 20T motor pulleys of 16mm widht.

I know this because im having that sort of cog (wheel pulley).. but just 16mm size one, as the one in picture looks to be 20-25mm one..

Thanks for the link.. that's basically the same place I found it.. but im not sure what wideness that pulley got.. it looks a bit wider than the 16mm I got now..

I remembered that you are not from usa, so this might be more relevant for these in usa.. but non the less, if you search for 6 x 1 - 1/4 tires on google.. there's a lot of results showing up.

I can't promise you - you have seen the pictures they have sent me and from I can see it looks like it should fit. However as @psychotiller mentioned, the way they mount the bearings is very unusual and could cause damage.

[quote]the bearing we fix it  to the wheel hub , only need that space.[/quote]

You see communicating with them is hard :smiley:

What would that tell us?
My guess is that they use a design like this:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/51c5a2498c32a38554512909612b9943d376638e.jpg" width="666" height="500">
but that puts a lot of stress on the bearings by leverage.
Also it still does not explain how they can fit 2 bearings and 20mm of spacer plus nut on just 37mm.
```

Well.. with the widht of the wheel I just meant just that - how much space does it really take up with all the bearings and a nut..

Anyways.. from the pictures it looks like the screw is sitting just fine on the axle.. There's not much ''over thread'' left.. but it looks nice and flush..So I assume they do get it working somehow.. with my guess is that perhaps their bearings are also a bit more ''narrow'' compared to regular ones lol :D

Plus im not sure how thick nuts you are using guys but Im having some ''slim profile'' ones, which takes up about 3-4mm.. Would need to measure them to be 100% sure..

And wrote that the axle is 37mm and each bearing is 7mm while the spacer is 14mm which leaves 9mm for the nut.
They also confirmed that the spacer is 14mm and not 2cm like what they told me earlier.
@OskarCastrone anything else i can ask them?

Edit: Spacer and Bearings are included in the hub price (5USD) :flushed:

Edit2: they also told me that shipping cost will increase with an added number of wheels. 12wheels would cost 100USD just in shipping. That is: ((12*9USD+100USD)*1.19+15EUR)/12=22USD per wheel
I HATE those shipping costs and DHL fees :angry:

The problem with DHL Express is, that in Germany they do the taxation for you with the customs office - basically they pay the fees with their own money. There is nothing you can do against this. Afterwards you will be asked to pay them back the money they spent plus an additional 15‚Ç¨ fee (I think it is like 10% of what they payed with a minimum of 15‚Ç¨) for their trouble.

The only downside is that they need a TB wide trucks or similar long axle truck. Also, they dont use the same bearings as regular longboard/skateboard wheels, the outer diameter is 26mm I believe. But all that I think for 80‚Ç¨ shipped with one week delivery is very good.

The 6 or 8 inch wheels? What pulleys do you use with them? Thanks

The 6 inch 3-spoke ones, silver version. I use pulleys from powerboard-dealer.de I am not sure where the pulleys are because they dont have the search function on their website but the name of the item in the email I received after ordering is "Zahnriemenkranz f√ºr MO-BO 800 Watt und 1300 Watt". They are 65t-HTD5M. If you search for that on Google you will find a buch of sellers, I saw it on ebay too but it was faster to buy from powerboard since they are in Germany, close to me (Slovakia). They look like this but the 3 holes dont fit, I had to make my own. But the 3 bolts in the spokes are a great way of mounting the pulley.

BTW: the hub is 2 halves and held together with the 3 nuts (plus axle nut when mounted on a truck) I did not find this in the listing when I bought them...

Thanks for the info. Did the 3 holes in the 65t pulley (in the picture above) almost align-up correctly to the holes in each of the hub spokes? And how did you make your own holes without the pulley wobbling on the wheel? It seems really difficult drilling them exactly in the center.

I took the hub apart and aligned the center of the aluminium pulley with the center of the hub using 8mm bolt around which k kept winding tape until it filled the hole in the center of the pulley. I then used it as a centering jig and marked the holes. It is important to drill them 1mm bigger so that you have 0,5mm free space around them. I then used the same centering jig I rigged up when the hub was back together and screwed longer bolts from the pulley, through one side of the hub that does not have threads and in it and into the side of the hub that has threads.

Cool, interesting technique. Do they spin without any noticeable wobble? That was my biggest issue until I managed to get some custom pulleys printed by Idea.

It took a lot of patience but I managed to make them completely wobble free on the first try :) was not even that hard. If I had a 3D printer back then I would probably print the tape and bolt thing to save some time and tape and maybe even get better accuracy :D

I messed up and got the 628 I didn't know about the diameter now I know they won't fit my trucks they are 10mm diameter. Any one know the number of the bearings which would be 24mm ODx10mm ID?

Bearings with those dimensions seem difficult to find. It might be easier to sell your 10mm axle trucks and buy a pair of Torqueboard 218mm.

I have a pair of tb218 trucks I just really wanted to use these rims on 10mm trucks specifically for speed testing

I found some but they cost around $8 a bearing that would come around $64 for a set too much may be later when I know there is no other way as for now thought of some 6901-2rs with a conversion spacer

I remember reading somewhere that the wheels have a max rating of 30 km/h so I wouldn't push them too hard. I've taken them up to 40 km/h but only for short bursts.

Nice idea. Some [10mm ID x 12mm OD (1mm thick wall) stainless steel tubing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/STAINLESS-STEEL-TUBE-12MM-OD-X-10MM-ID-1MM-WALL-316-SEAMLESS-MARINE-GRADE-/321817026501) could work well. Alternatively you could sell the wheels on the forum and buy a set which have the [correct 6000RS bearings you need](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/6X2-Inflation-Tire-Wheel-Use-6-Tire-Alloy-Hub-160mm-Pneumatic-Tyre-Electric-Scooter-F0-Pneumatic/32826704849.html). Airmail from HK/China will take a while though.

EDIT: I just checked and 6901-2rs bearings have a 6mm thickness, compared to the 628 bearings 8mm thickness. This could cause issues.

If the case of the 30km/h is true im probably going to use them on my kids board or sell them on the forum. They are still on 97mm flywheels and the streets out here suck. I did want to go fast like over 30mph but if these wheels can't handle that ill stick to the urban threads.

Did you use the original screws that came with the rims? If so what type are they because I measured them at 5.8mm but not sure if they are m6 or not?

The screws are M6. I kept the originals on the front wheels but needed longer screws (with longnuts) to hold the pulleys onto each back wheel.

On a side note:

Have not seen anyone using these remotes‚Ä¶(!) Trigger looks like it could be finnicky, like the evolve remote users have for their evolve‚Äôs.

Cheap also but I believe there would be some shipping cost also, besides the item price

 where to buy such a remote control? my remote contro stopped seeing the skate
