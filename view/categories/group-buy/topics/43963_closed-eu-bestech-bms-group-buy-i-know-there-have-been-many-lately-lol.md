So due to many problems with USPS I am still in dire need of a bms and can not wait much longer.
The following is not limited yet. If you have any suggestions concerning the selection of bms or cutoff voltages, let me know!
_

Offered choices:
HCX-D223V1 - 10s - https://goo.gl/59cbTh
HCX-D190 - charge only - without eswitch  - 10s - https://goo.gl/z7D9Gu

HCX-D223V1 - 12s - https://goo.gl/gZFY5z
HCX-D205V1 - charge only - without eswitch - 12s - https://goo.gl/Z7wSVu
_

Cutoff Voltages (conservative I think):
Over charge detection voltage: 4.20V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.10V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage; 2.80V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 2.90V+/0.1V
_

These prices are good guesstimates. Still waiting for Bestech to confirm and obviously in EU you never know exactly how much the customs office will make you pay. Not looking to make a profit so any changes larger than 2‚Ç¨ will be refunded/charged.

I will take a few and @Tomer is buying 3 so we got a small GB already. Would be nice to get some more orders to drive the fees down.

So this looks like the prices were about right, still depending on the customs charges. Would like to place the order this week still.
