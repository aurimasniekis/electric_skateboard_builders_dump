Since they are available to handle the shipping we could even arrange one EU/US group buy. What do you think?

He said that they will manage multiple shippings if required, so I guess they will be shipping separately from eu and us warehouses.

Only difference I see in this situation guys is difficulty in changing your mind whereas with individual purchases you could easily opt out and ask for refund.

So, best I let the confirmed buyers get together and run this thread ....

I would say somebody with a fast internet connection and one unlimited paypal account (to receive 5000$ usd in few days). 

I would also prefer somebody who has proven to be reliable in group buys.

If somebody fits in these requirements please volunteer below.

Bare in mind to organiser Enertion only accept credit card payment (not paypal)

Also check your cards foreign currency transaction fees. I got charged extra $32 for a tier 2 board (using amex)

Delivery charge is on top circa $50

I would absolutely love to as well, been dreaming about making this my first eskate and cant let dreams be dreams any more.

Unfortunately i live in the UK, not sure if that would be a problem. He said he can ship them separately and from different warehouses though so maybe it wouldn't matter.

Paypal is the best option for payments from the partecipants to the organizer. Then he will transfer the money into his bank account and will purchase on kickstarter with his credit card. (at least this is what I think is the best way to handle this).

Plus paypal offers a good payment insurance.

Problem with that is PayPal charges an extra fee for goods and services.  3%?   That's the only way you'd be covered.   Unless it's someone really trustworthy.  Like... No idea
```

## \#26 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-12-02T00:22:16.684Z Reads: 193

```

The other option is the group organizer ask for just 10% deposit from each group member, he pays for group buy upfront himself & gets all the boards delivered to him directly. Only then will he ask for the final payment from the other group members. Once money is received by the group organizer then ships the boards. This will only work if you are in the same country.

this reduces the risk.

Hi jason, that's a possibility but then everyone would be charged 2 times for shipping, and 2 times by paypal to transfer funds from participants to organiser and then from organiser to kickstarter.

I don't know much about the kickstarter platform, but on indiegogo you have something called a 'hidden perk' which cant be bought unless you have the secret URL. Here's an example that let you buy the Blink s2 for only $500 (you can type in "cache:" before the start of the URL to see the original message deleted by the author): https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/5f0119/acton_santa_special_prices_s1_299_s2_499_4wd_999/

Would it at all be possible for 5 people to get together who agree to buy the board and contact you, and for you to send them a secret URL for individual $899 prices rather than group?

The net effect would be the same (still need 5 people to buy 5 decks in bulk), but would avoid the possibility of people getting scammed or having to pay double shipping and double paypal fees.

Either way appreciate the second chance at lower prices, thanks mate.

Fee's are not incurred if you are using a linked checking account through friends and family, but the recipient would still be responsible for the 3% fee if you sent funds that are eligible for Buyer Protection. <-- This is only valid for 90 days from the day the money is sent.

But if someone is trust worthy on this site I would not mind putting in the extra $27

Looks like a matter of trust between all the buyers....

It seems you guys have enough to go in an get one pack....at the very least 

Need to figure out some equitable solution.....

Like I said ...I be changed my mind so those in should hash it out and not waste any time....

I will offer this as a solution......

I will act as escrow....if you want me to...but it will be up to you to determine the agreement... basically I will only hold the money and pay what you tell me to give to the person actually buying it....the balance will be held by me and paid once items are shipped....


It's the only solution I can offer since I'm not going to buy and you guys seem to not trust each other and seem to trust me .... I make no money doing this...the only thing I get out of doing this the satisfaction of getting the noobs on the road 


Your thoughts???? GO!!!!

Sooo it's hard for me to trust other people with my money.. 
so I will lead the group buy, who all wants in? 
You can send money to my PayPal account, 
And even with the small fee you will be getting it cheaper than buying it separately. 
Once Payments are received,  I will transfer money to a savings account that is set up specifically for the group buy, and then go ahead and process the group buy when all payments are received.   To ease yalls mind a little, I can give updates on the GB savings account by taking dated screen shots of the account on my phone. 
I would like everyone that wants in the group buy to provide their phone number to me so we can communicate in a group text, get each others information, and hammer out the details. Lets get this thing going so we can get this sweet board at a really good price.

The only problem i see is if the kickstarter is not fully funded.  I was totally on board 😉 for group buy until I saw Jason say "if the campaign doesn't get fully funded noone gets anything"  on his campaign video. 
Too much money for the risk, until it's fully funded. I'll just stick with my $1099 order. I guess the extra $200 is for peace of mind.

So who ever is putting up the credit card post up a list .....

And terms of the group buy between all of you.

What amount per person will I hold?


Only when you guys get 5 people you can send me the funds.

I get an email as soon as you guys send it....

Once I receive all the moneies ... I'll send the amount you all agree to the person paying.....

I will hold the balance for each of you...and let it sit till shipping or if the Kickstarter fails you get the balance from the person paying and I send back your deposits

So we have Enigmacpl03 @fedestanco Streetsurfer92...... it will only let me tag 2 users:( when will I be able to tag more than 2 users? Lol

Wouldn't it be easier if you bought the group buy though? I know you said you didn't want a board but you can just put down the addresses of 5 other people after we pay you. That would cut out the need for double transfers and reduce the likelihood of something going wrong. Cheers

@bucksd I have cancelled my Tier 3 order and from my understanding you have until April 2017 to cancel. In essence it is just a pre-order. As for the fee's I am not sure.

$952+ shipping charge too, I think it's $49, so it would be $1,001. I personally would like to not have to pay the PayPal transfer fee twice, and if we can do this without having to pay it twice, that really would be a lot better for everyone as the whole reason we want to do a group buy, is to get the best deal possible. But if that's what has to be done to be in the buy, I'm still in lol

@Michaelinvegas should definitely not have to pay anything at all, as he is offering a service to us.

Hi, my name is Fabian. 
I am very interested in joining your group buy but I am a little confused in how many people are in for the group buy. Let me know if there is a spot still available or if I could fill in a spot incase someone falls through. 

Is there a way were I could contact Mike directly? I will be making a trip from Socal to Las Vegas this month for the holidays and I could definitely drop off my share to complete the group buy. 

Mike, if possible could you private message me your phone number or email? Thanks.

Alright @Enigmacpl03, @Streetsurfer92, @yummyblobs, @Michaelinvegas, whats the plan?

Are we transferring money to Mich next week and he is making the payment?

How much are we transferring? 100% right away? Or like 20% down payment and 80% after shipping confirmation?

I calculate it to be $899 for the board.
+
Shipping is 334 Australian dollars. 66 AUS dollar or 49 USD each.
=
$950 USD rounding up (+ paypal fee we are each charged individually?)

anything I'm missing?

Also would Mich have to email Enertion with the kickstarter purchase ID and request 5 separate shipping addresses? Because i doubt that kickstarter has a form for that.

Just please be aware the exchange rate moves around...

So it could be plus or minus 961 ...

If is less I refund...if it's more i collect 

The final number will be the credit card charge divided by 5 

Also please note....

The shipping is for USA...Canada will need to pay extra unless they have a US address we can ship it to...so not sure how much extra a Canada 🇨🇦 delivery will be ...

@Michaelinvegas: awesome! Thanks for helping out with this. As I told you in pm I'm out partying atm so I can't sort the payment right away. I need to move money between my accounts and I don't have the token for my bank with me. Hope you're okay with me sorting everything tomorrow when I wake up. I'm not a nigerian prince, promise!

@onloop: could you add a $1 pledge to the KS? It's not possible to follow project updates on KS unless you've pledged an amount to the project.

Yup, I asked @Michaelinvegas if there was a spot for this group buy some hours ago, then I watched a hockey game which my team won and we went to a bar to celebrate. 
When I checked my phone a bit later Mike had sorted everything and even spotted me the money...

This forum and the people on here are awesome and the level of innovation, creativity and helpfulness here is just amazing!

@Eboosted: onloop changed the kickstarter so you can now buy 2x Raptors for 899 each.
Easiest thing to do would be to find a friend or someone else on the forum and buy a pack together. 

@Michaelinvegas did a great job of organizing the 5x group buys, atleast for me it was sorted in less than 24h with no effort from my side but paying but Mike and the others had been trying to work it out for a few days before I joined.
But since it's the same prices for the 2x now, you should be able to handle it on your own.

Looks like a little confusion on the group buy....

@rwxr is in Sweden....

So checking with @onloop if we can still help him here....

If not @Eboosted said he is willing to take his spot....

...... if @rwxr is out...I think he wants todo a group buy for his country so help him if he needs getting people if that should be the case

Hey, yeah, as Mike said theres been a little misunderstanding. Fault is on me. 

If there's not an easy solution to this, I'll give my spot to @Eboosted and I'll try to find someone to do a 2x group buy with instead. Preferably in sweden or denmark. Other parts of EU should also work if shipping is easily solvable. 

Cheers

Shipping might cost a bit more And working out what qty to distribute into each country might be harder.

To keep it simple It's probably better to do group buy with friends in the same country.

Ok, I am confused.. I thought you had to organize a 5x group buy to get the board for $899.  But I just looked at the Kickstarter again, and there are 2x group buys for the same $899 price.  Shipping per board is still about $50 USD whether you get 5x or 2x.  Actually it is $6 cheaper per board overall when you only buy TWO.

Am I missing something here?
.

_**2x Group Buy:**_  (AU$ 2553) / 2 = ($1901.39) / 2 = **$950.70 per board**

.

_**5x Group Buy:**_  (AU$ 6424) / 5 = ($4784.37) / 5 = **$956.87 per board**

The exchange rate will affect the USD price because it is constantly varying.  The Australian dollar price, however, does not change.  It's still more expensive per unit to buy 5 then it is to buy 2.

* AU$ 1276.50 per board at 2X

* AU$ 1284.80 per board at 5X


EDIT: 

* 2X:  AU$ 1206.50 + 70.00 s/h
* 5X:  AU$ 1218.00 + 66.80 s/h

Congratulations on organizing the 1st form group buy, I thought it would never happen! :smile:

So, I'm still interested, but would love a summary of how this whole process works, as it seems quite complex.

Also, I understand Enertion will ship to each individual in the group, is this correct? and how do we supply the address to them through Kickstarter?

Lastly, what happens if someone in our group drops out?

@thatfilmguy actually two essentially stepped out of the buy..but I hadn't clicked the button on KS
.....

But once I hit the button no backing out.

....

Basically I'm the bag man.... for all in the group buy.... you send me your money and address for shipping.... I pay for the KS and send them your Address....

Hit me by PayPal...u can use the merchant way but you pay the fee .... or the free way by friends and fam.....So theres an exchange rate that we need to deal with so the final cost will bounce around a little ....

That's pretty much it not sure what the 2nd group is doing ..... I know like yourself you aren't on the forum everyday and some of them are like that too.... so need to get the band back together and see what up

So, if I remember right there used to be two middleman in the process, you as the escrow holder, and a member of the group buy that the money is transferred to after the kickstarter is successfully backed.

Did something change?  Are you now the only middleman? If so that would be great!

I'm in for the $899 price plus fees, should come in under $1k which saves me almost $200. 

If someone wants to private message me, we can exchange info, maybe talk on the phone, and figure this out. I'm currently in Wyoming but will be in California when these boards start shipping.

Great news! I found our 3rd! I'm going to  send Jason a note asking for logistics. If he says we have to go through kick starter I'm going to ask both of you to send payment to me through PayPal. I will provide you with all of my info including my name address and telephone number. You are welcome to call me if you wish if that makes you more comfortable. You can also verify anything I give to you through Jason since I have bought many things from him before. I'm located in Marblehead, Massachusetts.i'm going to check if it's possible just to send payment directly to Jason. If that's possible then we won't even have to go through PayPal. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Hey, Thanks for the support!

Unfortunately, the group buys are only available via the Kickstarter & Can only be purchased by one person.

If i let people pay me directly & individually for group buy it is very unfair to those who had to pay higher prices per single unit.

hope that makes sense.

Ok. So as you can see Clement Jason has replied that we have to go through kickstarter. If we want to do this I'll need you to send me the funds and all your info. I will make the purchase from kickstarter and send you all the information. Please tell me anything you'd like me to do to verify any info you want. Please contact me via private message to arrange everything. I think we need to do this somewhat quickly since I think the kickstarter campaign ends tomorrow.

Armand,

Myself (jojosensor) and knuck887 are all ready to purchase. We've spoken on the phone already and really want to try and accomplish this. We'd love you to be a part of it so we could take advantage of the $899 price. Do you want to do this with us? I sent you the complete breakdown of costs. We can both send you all of our information. We want to make this as completely transparent to each of us as possible and make everyone feel comfortable. Please reply back to me with your interest level if possible. Thanks.

Just a quick update

The charges on the card are still pending

But based on the number I see it looks like it came under $950 per board

when things settle down and it's a full charge on he credit I'll have a final number for all of you.

So,some may get some money back and some will owe ...

I'll let you know where your each at soon

I hear you @bucksd and @Eboosted

I'll post up the list tomorrow when I have time.


But for now.....

This is what finally got posted on the credit card 💳 last night.....

So, your exact amount is your group number (either 3 or 5) divided by what was charged. (There is a total of 8 people)

So, the difference in what you paid me is what I either owe you back or what you owe me.

Like I said .... I have the girls So...I need to find a minute tomorrow to break out a calculator.

What do we know about separate shipping addresses? Also what do we know about what each person owes?

RAPTOR 2 PROGRESS REPORT
Posted by Jason Potter (Creator)
Happy New Year Everyone!
I would like to apologize for not updating on Kickstarter since the end of the Kickstarter campaign 40 days ago. It's been a busy start to 2017!
So here is an update for everyone!
Firstly, I took some time off for Xmas & holidays period with my little family, it was nice to have a break from work and eat some nice food and relax.

We also took a little trip to Kangaroo Island, it's just off the coast of South Australia. It's very nice. I took this photo on my phone.

Shortly after my Xmas holiday, I went to visit some key manufacturing partners in china. 

I was very eager to see the new R-SPEC GHOST motors that we have been working on for well over 12 months. We have sampled many motors from many Chinese factories over the last few years and this new factory has definitely delivered the goods. 
The motors look awesome! Testing so far is very good, we will now be working on final optimizations to get maximum performance. We still have some time up our sleeve before we must commit and place the final order so we will take the time and make little improvements. For example, We managed to further improve the mechanical design to save about 30% in weight without compromising performance. We will have our esk8 dyno built later this week so we can start running lab tests.
We will also be doing real life tests like hill climbs & sprints and of course making videos for our youtube channel.

As of this week, I finally got all the bits & pieces together to make a complete working Raptor 2. Before now I only had random samples & prototypes to play with.
This is the final look at a complete Raptor 2 as you will be receiving in MAY 2017 - I think it looks awesome and can't wait to start riding it.

For more frequent Raptor 2 updates please be sure to check out these sites below:
1. The esk8 builders forum
2. For behind the scenes photos, Enertion is on Instagram
3. For videos updates, Enertion Youtube Channel

Also, can you find out if we are in the first 30 units that will be shipped out in May as per his live facebook chat the other day or in the June shipment which he will ship out the other 470 units, I think we got early enough to be first right?

Michaelinvegas Can you find out where in line we stand because as per his website this is what he has posted..I hope we are in May..

"a 30 unit production ramp-up in MAY 2017, Then our plan is to build the remaining 470 in June / July. We believe the 500 units will be sold out before end of July! The next batch of 500 won't ship until september/october 2017."

Our summer here in Canada just started and winter hits us again in September so not much time to ride :-(

Yeah I still owe you money Michael. 

I'm impressed how you found the time to organize the group buy and still put money on your side just to help brothers on the community, thanks for that! 

BTW, as we were a group buy from the kickstarter and we don't have order number, do you know if we would get the boards on June/July?

At this point, you would need to go to enertion's website to preorder your board. They are still doing group buys, but it is no longer with kickstarter. You should receive yours at the end of this month or July. @Vishnu @Peeta

Part 1 of 2 - I went to a meeting in Montreal yesterday to have a look at and ride the newest, baddest and fastest electric board that is about to enter the market called the Raptor 2. Made by Enertionboards founder Jason Potter a guru of electric skateboards did an amazing job putting this board together from scratch..took him about a year but man is this thing something! I am on the list of orders to receive mine and have been waiting patiently since early Dec 2016. A full review will be done when I receive my unit so, we met up in Montreal with Jason's technical engineer Charles Alex for an amazing afternoon with pizza, drinks and of course a good hour of awesome Raptor 2 riding along a great parc in downtown Montreal. These guys are a class act very generous and kind people..was a pleasure to have met them. The Raptor 2 electric longboard is by far the best work of art money can buy with a top speed of 53.5km/h just recently achieved by a member and guaranteed 49.5km/h achieved several times by others. Shipping just started and I can't wait to get mine. If you want one just hit Enertionboards on Facebook and place your order it kills Evolve and Boosted and all the other companies out there.
