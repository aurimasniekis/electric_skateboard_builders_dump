After getting everything worked out its time to start collecting payment for the Unity's if we want to get this rolling. Preferably everyone can get the order in today. The target is 100 units, and I will cover what we dont get. 

https://buildkitboards.com/products/focbox-unity-pre-sale 

That being said, this is a group buy and purchases are non refundable I am not making any money at this and I cant go refunding people before the product ships. Expect delays, dont order if you cant wait until next year. At 100pcs the price is $215 shipped to me + 3% transaction fee ($7) and $0.50 for packaging ($222.50 total + shipping). **USA and Canada ONLY.** I cannot ship internationally cheaper than Enertion because USPS isint reliable overseas (except for Canada).

Shipping should calculate to $3.90 for one unity and $4.81 for two. Anything over that dosnt qualify for first class and is $7 flat rate.

**Payments are due ASAP.** If everyone can get the order in today it will make things go much smoother.

I have been working with @thisguyhere here to organize this so if you have any questions please let me or him know.

@JLabs, couple of questions.

will your standard $7 shipping apply to all orders?

do you need payments in by the end of the 4 day sale (sunday, i'm guessing) so you can get the bulk order in to enertion?
```

so for rationalizing buying multiple, can we count a unity as one esc? :slight_smile:

When you put it on the cart the website asks you not to add anything else to the order at this time. He will contact you once it's ready to ship to see if you want to include other things.

This is absurd! Shipping should not cost so much! How dare you !

But honestly, thanks @JLabs and @thisguyhere for getting this group buy together. Let's hope these 1st batch will work well...and that it gets to our hands by 2020

I’m getting two units totaling $450 shipped. If you think of this as FOUR FocBoxes it’s basically a bit over the Black Friday FocBox price. 

Time to go get my $6 coffee. (Yeah I’m one of those)

According to Jason's live stream from the 15th 21 Unity's are considered a small order and therefore don't qualify for better shipping prices?

It seems strange how linear the shipping prices are for these things.

21 Unities is a 5 grand order. For an order that large, packing 21 of them into a single box to ship should be inconsequential. @JLabs What happens if you don't get enough preorders?

[quote="DragonSwagin, post:54, topic:65080"]
packing 21 of them into a single box to ship
[/quote]

Clearly, based on the pricing ($354.71 for 21 pcs. to USA), they ship each one as a separate, tracked parcel.  
  
It'd be ridiculous for anyone to suggest that's the price of one box, and even more ridiculous for someone to believe it.

So if you order 21 pieces, you should have 21 different packages arriving.  Unless they are just pocketing the money.

@JLabs I am thinking about getting this for my Jetspud setup, but I already have 2 Focboxes atm...I am very interested in the Unity, especially because I feel that linking the Firefly remote will be lest risky on the Unity, due to the lack of a need for a Canbus connection. Would it be worth it to get the Unity instead?

It's not an absolute necessity but helpful. How's the connection with the receiver

## \#60 Posted by: Kit Posted at: 2018-08-17T18:57:56.599Z Reads: 182

Not sure atm tbh, I just placed the order - I got lucky to get into the Batch 2 order for the fireflys. It uses the UART connection for the receiver. I think the Unity still has 2 UART connectors so I should be also able to use @JLabs bluetooth module on the other connection. 

But I am unsure if there needs to be a canbus setup on the Unity, since they're on the same unit already.

I'm actually looking forward to the unity. Yea Enertion isn't pleasant to deal with, but from what I've heard from Jeff I'm confident it'll be quality. Seems like a lot of thought was put into it.

I've already reached out to Enertion.  They need the Order Owner to reach out to them to get an ETA.  So between you and thisguyhere, can you reach out and update us on the order you two organized and completed.  Thanks guys!

Not sure if any of you are following the other Unity thread but Moros posted that the initial round will be shipping in the next week roughly. Hopefully that means good news for us as it also says the next round won't be shipping until Feb.. :slight_smile:
