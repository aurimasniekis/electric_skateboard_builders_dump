As requested, you peeps wanted a group buy for just about everything. So here you have it. This GB includes:

**1. Wheels:** 83mm, 90mm, and 97mm. We can pick 2 colors, TBD later. Most likely black and orange
**2. Motor Mounts:** I have several designs as do others, we can choose what ones later. 
**3. Battery Packs**: 10s3p and 10s4p, BMS and charger. I will get a lot more info later. @ajaynagra has found, what I believe a very good manufacturer. I will of course be doing a lot of digging as these are important.
**4. VESC's:** The motor manufacturer that I use has actually started making VESC's. I have 2 on the way for testing and will post my results. 
**5. Pulley Kit:**  Includes wheel pulley for flywheels, motor pulley, belt, and necessary bolts. 

Not in the group buy, but still really good prices.
**1. Motors:** 6354 and 6374 available. Both soon to be in stock. Only $8 more dollars than the last group buy! Order/Pre-Order [here.](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/)
**2. Mini Remotes:** Pre-Order for below Group Buy Prices! The last group buy was for $33 and I sell them for $30! You guys bought them all out quick so I will be ordering more. You can pre order them [here.](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/2-4ghz-mini-remote-receiver/)

## How the group buy works:
I need to know what you guys are interested in. So please fill out this form if you wish to participate! https://goo.gl/forms/ifNgActnBrlUqFie2
After I see what is popular I will get final prices for the quantity demanded and then post the products on the eSk8 Market, and that is how you will pay for them. Why the eSk8 Market? Because management is key, if there are a lot of orders I will pull my hair out any other way. It also lets you guys have PayPal purchase protection.
## Timeline
Everything should ship in 2 weeks or so, after I close purchasing of the products. The only exceptions are the batteries and motor mounts as they are custom made. 
##Prices
As this is an extreme amount of work, I am making a few dollars off of each sale. I want to make that clear from the get go. The money will just go to buying more stock for my small eSk8 business [Polar.](https://electric-skateboard.market/store/polar/) Prices are not final, they may sway up or down. I will be sure to keep you updated. 
**1. Wheels:** $20/set of 4
**2. Motor Mounts:** $24/piece
**3. Battery Packs:** 10s3p with BMS $150 - 10s4p with BMS: $195
**4. VESC:** $82
**5. Pulley Kit:** $30
I still need to talk with Ajay more about prices as he is the one who is talking with some of the manufacturers. 
So there you have it, if you want to participate fill out this form so I get a general idea. You guys can edit your responses and see total data. https://goo.gl/forms/ifNgActnBrlUqFie2

Was about to submit, but I'm curious about the layout of the batteries. I was hoping to do a slim build.. any way to do one layer of 30 (10x3), rather than stacked? I don't know how most people here typically do their 10S3P builds.

@landonkun  @chinzw I will get measurements asap. We will have to pick one layout, and it will most likely be flat. 

@wmj259 The motors and vesc are in shipment, arriving early next week. I will be sure to let u guys know. You also have 87mm wheels, vesc, and a pulley set.

Okay updates for everyone.. The batteries are going to be in sleds and laid flat. 2 cells but to but 20 side to side (or 15 for 10s3p). Batteries will be in sleds and should have 2 layers of nickel strips. BMS will have a built in switch, and will come with a 2a charger.

## Prices for loaded packs: Battery + BMS + Charger + Percentage Display

10s3p: $185usd (non-final, but pretty accurate)
10s4p: $243usd (non-final, but pretty accurate)

I have roughly calculated the dimensions of the pack, the 3p should be: 132mm wide x 303.5mm long x 10mm high. Again that is rough, and not final but you get the point.. Batteries are USA only, unless @landonkun is willing to have them shipped to the USA and then take them back to Canada with him.
 
Let me know who is interested **for all items** because an error happened with the google form and I cannot see individual responses.

## Motor Mounts
What file do you guys want to use? I have my one piece, and Ajay is most likely using the mount that has a left and right version. Any files you guys want to share? Mounts will be sand blasted and anodized black (most likely).

Pulley kits are same as DIY and you can get some extra belts. Wheels are also available. The VESC's are coming Tuesday and I will be sure to test them out. Any questions let me know.

@JLabs, thank you so much for putting them together. I'm totally beginner and this seems to be the deal for my build. I am interested in buying:
 +  97mm Flywheel Clones
 +  10s4p Samsung 25R Battery with loaded packs: Battery + BMS + Charger + Percentage Display
 +  2 VESCs
 +  2 motor mounts
 +  2 sets of Motor / Wheel Pulley Kit (Belt, Bolts, Pulleys)

Beside the battery, are other parts still have accurate prices as you indicated above? And when will you have the mini remote available again?

Hey @JLabs,  Just want to make sure that people know that the mounts I made were specific to the SK3 63XX Motor which has a bolt pattern of 32mm,square and all other 44mm diagonal motors. your [motors](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/) are 30mm and 44mm bolt patterns so they WILL BE COMPATIBLE with the 44mm.

Edited this to avoid confusion.

What do your mounts look like to begin with? Is it [this](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pick-your-next-motor-mount-design/11891) because if thats the case @JLabs may as well go with the classic [enertion mount](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/free-enertion-simple-motor-mount-open-source/12846) that he finally made completely open source if we're taking about design A.  It's proven and yours are just remakes of it for the most part. B and C are remakes of [DIY's mount](category/electric-skateboard-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-mount/)

yes i went with this style so they use locknuts instead of tapping aluminum. (lower cost and more fool proof) but there are many more options if using tapped threads.

B  I give the credit to _psychotiller_ because he did that style well before torque.

But lately i've been looking into style F (keep scrolling) because of forces being applied and it would make other truck types possible(**_CRONIN_**) and insert style adapter are very cheap even in us only $3ish (x50+).

style C is nothing like diy or any mount i've seen aside from ollin's new mount that is using an adjustable idler with fixed ctc. which was released later, i wish i had my own cnc! :p

Did not realize you were going for a nut and bolt version vs tapped.  All I meant to convey is that the motor mount market is for the most part saturated.  Unless you can bring something new to the table (in regards to form factor,  functionality,  material savings ) then it's going to be very difficult to get others to want to make the switch to your product. 
@JLabs and I went all in with one piece models,  there are draw backs to this,  like you have to have two distinct sides so you have to have two files for machining,  might require more money,  higher order quantity,  won't appeal to everyone,  but there are other obvious benefits (fixed angles,  no need to mess around with setting up the mounts, better strength in the piece, much better ground clearance,  etc.)  and so when designing pic your point and design to achieve it.

[quote="JuniorPotato93, post:100, topic:13449"]
so when designing pic your point and design to achieve it.
[/quote]

since my background is in software(CS), I went after it with the mindset to fix as many issue while keeping cost low, and manufacturing in the US. since I've had multiple mounts break i wanted to make them stronger first. But also as adaptable as possible because one size does not fit all! lol x slot fits all motor sizes, enough angle adjustment for any board, and of course locknuts so you can crank it down without worrying of stripping threads! and just for bonus I added idlers, i bet these will catch on when Olin's mounts are released! 

I don't see it as a product, once its tested it will go open source. When  I started playing with these options for mounts were actually very limited (and overpriced!) The market has grown a lot in a few months tho!

i never really liked the lack of feel from calibers anyways, been running a Bear Truck on the front!

Thats cool. Just gonna remind everyone there's 2 separate files. There's a left and right side. @ajaynagra has both files. 

To do dual rear/front you need one of each.
To do dual diagonal version 1 you'll need 2 right sides to do heel side rear, toe side front.
Or to do dual diagonal version 2 you'll need two lefts for toe side rear, heel side front.

I should mention it was designed for use of a 255T belt with a motor gear of 15 and 36 wheel but there's play in that so one up and down works well too with the same 255T belt. I've even had the board 17:36 for a bit and there was sufficient play for that.

Point 1 - "Schedule 2, Special Provision 34" is this:

If you look at (b) it says the pack cant be more than 100wh.

The 10s3p pack would be 270wh correct? Which means it wont be able to be shipped. 

I'm gonna do a bit more research, i'm sure theres a way to get these shipped.

@mm6ix 

Hmm I found a thing in Canada Post's regulations that say the same thing.
But honestly, I don't see the average Joe post office worker at Shopper's Drug Mart really knowing too much about batteries. I could label it as a skateboard battery, and if they whip out their guidelines book and ask me if it's under 100Wh, and I say yes, it gets shipped by ground. I don't think there would be a problem, unless they really crackdown on that sort of stuff (which I'm guessing they only do for planes).

@JLabs 

Great, thanks! I also asked earlier about the possibility of getting extra belts. Is that also a thing?

Yeah I just called, Canada post twice asking about the battery situation, both times the customer service reps sounded unsure and provided different guidelines.

Personally I think we should be fine as long as we say that the rating of the battery is less than 100wh and to just add a dangerous goods label. 

Anyway, @JLabs you can go ahead and confirm my order for 10s3p and a vesc.

So just to help clear up confusion on how to order the appropriate "side"  for your set up. 

The motor mount file names are as follows.  Please use the file name when ordering. 

**Motor Mount 2. = Goofy Heel side, Regular Toe Side.**
**Motor Mount 2_Mir. = Goofy Toe Side, Regular Heel Side.**

## \#201 Posted by: JuniorPotato93 Posted at: 2016-12-11T04:27:58.760Z Reads: 98

There are 2 files because it's a one piece motor mount. One's a mirror image of the other. So if people say they want a right side what does that mean, without a reference it means nothing. So then you say well I want heel side, well again are you a regular or goofy stance?

So to avoid confusion the first file, for ordering motor mounts, use the file names so that you know what it is you're ordering. Motor Mount 2. is going to be for anyone who is a goofy rider and wants a heel side rear drive board. or if you're a regular rider then its a rear drive toe side.

The opposite for Motor Mount 2_Mir(ror).

These mounts,  due to the fixed angle,  do not mount backwards facing the rear of the board.  They mount facing underneath the deck. 

If you want a Gt style rear motor mount for now you'll have to use a mount like @psychotiller's which can be mounted in both orientations. 

If you want a single piece mount for that you'll have to wait a bit.  I was gonna make this mount open on thingiverse once I'm done my exams and have time to model somethings over the break. But you'll also have to get it made which may be costly for a single piece.

Oh OK got it. But I thought even if they were angled differently it wouldn't matter  just flip the way its facing and the side its on. Wouldn't matter the design. Specially if it's like the one's in the pictures from the beginning of this post.
```

## \#208 Posted by: JuniorPotato93 Posted at: 2016-12-11T19:42:52.265Z Reads: 91

```
So you'd think so but it's a little different because you're flipping the angle relative to the center plain of the hanger,  not the truck itself.  The mount is angled  about 25° downwards of the 55° plain of the caliber II.  So you end up with a relative angle of about 30 degrees.  So you flip that and you don't get 30° off the back of the truck but rather 80° upwards.  Which most definitely will collide with your board.  

The design change you want is actually quite simple and once I'm done exams I can change the file or @jackw also has the files if he can do that for you too if you wish to get those machined yourself.

I ride regular (left foot forward), and this means on a single-motor setup, I should go toe side, from what I understand.
Does this mean I should get the left mount, or right mount?
Wasn't sure if that was left/right looking at the top of the board or the underside.

Went to shop to order, did not find any description of 1023p and 10s4p batteries, and a little hard to scour the forum thread here.
Any further information than 10s3p is 132mm wide x 303.5mm long and 20.2mm high?
Does that make 10s4p 400mm long?
Confirm BMS has built-in switch and 2a charger, but BMS is 60a or 80a continuous rated?

Anything else to know now that finalized?

Thanks!

Sorry man I have been pressed for time the past week and just threw them up there. The batteries have 'spacers' so Space cell dimensions should be accurate. The batteries have a 77a BMS (if I correctly recal I know it's higher than 60a) with a built in eswitch, and charger.

M4's will fit the motor mounts as that is what motors take. Can be socket head cap screws or pan head, it wont matter. I mount mine with a washer even to increase the contact area.

Forgive the dirt but you got tons of room.  I put on huge washers,  you obviously don't need to.

The mounts are designed for 50 Degree Calibers. If you compare 50's beside 44' you will see that the missing 6 degrees would result in less space between then mount and the board. It's the same thing with enertion's mount. You put that on 44's and you will be touching the deck.

## To the guys who ordered Pulley kits:

Would you be okay with a 16t motor Pulley? I have checked with 3 different suppliers (the only ones who make the kind of Pulley we need) and they are all out of stock and have ridiculous MOQ (300-500pcs). One manufacturer is doing a 16t run and is allowing me to add on to their other customers order. So is 16t ok with everyone? I don't know any other options (unless someone has a 3D model of a 15t 12mm HTD5 8mm bore timing Pulley).

Ah, that's great news! Regardless, I certainly wouldn't request to cancel after you've paid, of course. 

Though I do believe that the 25R cells are spec'd at 20A max discharge, so 3p would yield 60A and 4p would yield 80A max discharge, right? What's the current limit on the BMS, by the way? 

Thanks!

Just wanted to update everyone. Everything but the VESC has been ordered. There are not enough VESC so we are waiting a few days for the next round to be made. The forwarder has started receiving packages! 

The first battery will be made Tuesday and I will have them check everything over before proceeding with the rest. 

Shipping is way more than I anticipated, it's going to be over $500 and as much as $800. I'm not sure what to do here, Ajay and I need to discuss on how to proceed. 

Happy New Year, and thanks for not spamming me with messages. It's much easier to get things done when I'm not replying to people 24/7, so thank you and enjoy your holiday!

Just wanted to give you peeps an update. Everything but the VESC is ordered. CNC is well underway, and most of the other parts are arriving at the forwarder. Battery production is in full swing. The ball is definitely rolling, and still good for the timeline.

Edit: VESC's are not ordered because they don't have any, 11th January is when the next production run is finished.

How do you not use FOC for more than 10 minutes? Bench testing??? :neutral_face::neutral_face::neutral_face:

Question: 
Is it possible to use (assume here that I am running dual motors) one VESC in FOC while the other VESC is in BLDC? 
It would just be that turbo effect one motor kicking in while the other is slow. Right?

Haha I dont know man if they are bullshitting me or jlabs. I just provided a translation.
Probably the statement the gave to me is a bit more reliable since I asked it after I received the vescs and after I told them they worked.
Plus, the fact that no warranty is included makes it (the statement) even more reliable since they were just giving me a friendly suggestion, and not promoting their product.

Yes I know the discharge wires are ridiculously long, I will most likely trim them. And yes, I know the wire length for the switch is too short, I am working on fixing it. This was the sample pack (not production run). I am getting final dimensions today for you peeps.

In inches, 10s4p;

L 12.5

I had a nice chat with UPS, and I can ship ground without any additional requirements (beyond lithium stickers and no fly paperwork). I calculated $18.01 to Chula Vista, CA so if you are closer to Pennsylvanians should be cheaper (for 10s3p dimensions) Then it's $3.00 for a box and necessary stickers. This is for domestic shipping. This does not include shipping from China to me.

And just to clarify for everyone else. I only charged $6.80 for shipping (domestically from me to you) because that is the smallest amount for the small orders. In the Europe GB Ajay charged everyone when they paid for shipping. I was unsure how much shipping was going to be so I waited. I will get in contact you if additional payments are required for domestic shipping. So if your total for shipping for a battery is $18 and you already paid $6.80 then you would only owe $11.20. I hope that makes sense to everyone. I stated this before but just wanted to be extra sure that everyone was aware. 

Thanks for your time and patience.

Still waiting battery tracking (FedEx)... Aparently there are too many packages being shipped out of China so they are backed up a bit.

## Shipping Arrangements
***
I have found that USPS makes a Flat Rate board game box hat fits 1 battery and still has room left for other stuff! I think it is by far the best option, and it's only $18.75 for con US. 

Let me know what you guys think.. If you ordered a battery + other goods (depending on size) you would owe $11.95. 

If you bought other stuff (say a mount and Pulley kit) that fits in a flat rate bubble mailer, so you owe no extra shipping (as you were charged $6.80 at checkout)

Let me know what you guys think!
***
## Also, in almost half of the orders the additional shipping was not paid. Please send that asap!

Does the pulley fit onto the wheels that your also giving? Do they clip in or have to be bolted?

They are bolted, designed by @JuniorPotato93
The Flywheel pulleys should fit the wheels, there is always a small chance you may have to shave off some black andoization for it to fit.

I think mm6ix is having his battery shipped to the border for me to pick it up, so I'm thinking it might be easier if you just ship our orders in the same box and he pays the difference in shipping?
Unless shipping isn't much cheaper combined, then just keep them separate.

Look at what just arrived! ;) 

These look absolutely beautiful. Testing has commended, I still need to make the wires shorter, but other than that BEAUTIFUL! 

I also received the pulleys and mounts. The pulleys do not fit in the flywheel clones that are apart of the GB. The 'teeth' that go in the wheel are about .5mm to wide and it dosnt fit. I took it to the lathe and trimmed a bit and it fits perfectly. Let me know if you just want me to send you your Pulley as is (@JuniorPotato93 files) so it may work for real flywheels. This isint Juniors fault, but I just don't understand what happened. I will post pics later..

I'll take mine reworked, I don't mind the bare aluminium on the portion that mates with the wheel.  I'm very sorry they came out slightly  oversized for all those affected. @JLabs, the real flywheels should have the same sized core so I think it's best they be brought down .5mm to ensure  everyone can use them when they get them. I don't know how many pulleys that is to rework but if it's a significant amount I don't mind donating a little extra for your time.

The mating portion of the pulley came out. 5mm too large regardless of it being used on a genuine flywheel or a one.  The hub diameters are the same and as such these need to be reworked to 40.0mm to fit in any wheel..  
Let JLabs mill it down right and concentric because if you don't have a lathe and try to fix it yourself your pulley will be off center and cause you uneven tension during rotation which can result in a pulsing sensation.

@JLabs, I'm confused. I thought you said that they dont fit flywheel clone, but will fit the original fly wheel. I do have a set of original abec11 flywheel. If thiß is still true, then yes, I can use the pulley with my abec11 flywheel.

I got a few more orders out tonight.. Bad news (and a small book) inbound:

I 3d printed the retainer caps for the flywheel kits, as I was only provided 7pcs of useless 1mm caps from the CNC manufacturer. This really wasn't a problem, just a few hours on the printer. When the first batch of 5 came out I was getting ready to ship a few more orders, and then something caught my eye. The bolts that I had for the pulleys were really short, so I measured, and they are barely long enough to go through the wheel by them selves, not including the pulley and cap. So I need new longer bolts. M4x50mm were ordered, and M4x65mm are needed. 

Now, I am not one to pass blame, or accuse people of anything. I am just going to lay out how Ajay and I did the behind the scenes stuff and let you guys know why there are errors.  I took care of ordering remotes (3 types), vesc, chargers, connectors, BMS, motor pulleys, belts, battery monitors, anti spark switches (which were not even aprt of my group buy), and most importantly the batteries. The batteries took the longest and most communication to make sure we crossed our t's and dotted out i's. Ajay had wheels, CNC pieces, and bolts.  Everything that I had to take care of was at the forwarder 1-3 days before crunch time (the few days leading up to CNY). I had been on Ajay asking for updates on CNC and wheels for weeks, and he said that he was emailing them. A few days before CNY I took matters into my own hands and emailed the CNC people (they got back to me in 5 minutes) and said that the pulleys would be ready in 1.5 weeks (after CNY). Now, Ajay had sent them the full payment 1-1.5 months before, giving them ample time. But, they were constantly reminded or asked when the ship date was. Im sure this led to them taking their grand old time. I then very politely said I needed them shipped tomorrow, and got them to move it up a week. I then had to pay another $88 to get the stuff shipped from China as the other items were already shipped by the forwarder. Now for the wheels.. I had been asking Ajay for updates again and again.. They finally were able to ship the wheels 2 days before the other items had to be shipped by the forwarder. 1-2 days shipping was ~$125usd as they were far away from China. I was not going to pay that much, so took the slower option that had them arrive the day after the forwarders CNY break started. I luckily built a very good relationship with the forwarder and she came in on her 1st day off of CNY to receive the wheels and ship them with the other items. While I am by no means saying that these delays are Ajay's fault, I thought that they could have been easily prevented by better communication with me and with the manufacturers. 

I then received the pulleys and come to find out they dont fit. So I fixed the problem, by putting them in the lathe. The cause of this problem is still under investigation. I then only got 7pcs of the completely useless 1mm outside caps, so again I fixed this by 3d printing some proper ones. (I could bend the aluminium caps by hand). Finally, when I thought most of it was over, the bolts are way to short... I just pray this is the last issue. Im not sure how it happens, but it did. 

***
Anyway, I have learned from this experience, and needless to say it will not happen again. I cannot apologise more for the delays, as I should have gone about this differently. This will be my last group buy. I am deciding to take my business ventures in a different direction than Ajay, which is perfectly okay by the both of us. If your down here to the end your a real trooper, and again, sorry for the delays. I would also like to take a minute to thank @JuniorPotato93 for the pulley files and for helping me through this.  
***
In the end, I do not want to blame or discredit Ajay in any way. He did most of the upfront work finding suppliers etc. This just seems to be a means of CNC tolerances and miscommunication.

I want to add to that with regards to the Kegel and Flywheel pulleys. I did provide a file for the pulleys and they are the exact same files that are available online on thingiverse with the exception that I had to make them CNC friendly meaning no fancy curves and accounting for the tool nose radius which is not something you have to worry about with 3D prints. Here is what I sent Ajay yesterday in a private message after I had spent some time looking at the data provided and re-examining both my files and destroying one of my own flywheel clones to extract the hub from it.

"After reviewing both my files, the measurements and pictures JLabs presented and destroying one of my own flywheel clones to get a better look at only the core I've reflected and come to a suitable conclusion. That is, the CNCed files came out as they were intended with a little bit of extra material but from looking up CNC tolerances I figure that's probably well within the tolerances for those CNCs.

The source of the real issue here is that the 3D printed files fit.

What I mean by that is the files when printed have always come out about .1-2mm mm larger than they were intended to from what I measured on my printed flywheel clones but they fit anyways. So I never looked at the mating portion of the flywheels again. I've only ever focused on changing the pulley and the sizing for different wheels.

But what they all have in common is that they are made of plastic which has a lower young's modulus of elasticity than aluminium. So sure the files are slightly too large but you and I would never realize because one you line it up and push they slide in tight anyways. So the plastic prongs or studs will flex and follow the tapered surface. But we can't see it happen, the rest of the pulley is blocking the view.

When we made them out of aluminium it no longer flexed as easy to allow it to slip on anyways. So what I thought was a perfect fit in a 3D printed file is actually an interference fit and so when we changed the medium of the pulley it kinda all went to shit.

The aluminum did not bend as much as the plastic does to allow the pulley to insert fully into the wheel. This would have only been detected by CNCing the file which is unfortunate that it happened this way but with JLabs measurements of the CNCed pulley and with the destroyed flywheel I know have I remeasured all critical dimensions and fixed the file for CNCs."

They were 50-60% when shipped. When you plug the charger into the wall there's a default greenlight on the brick, you actually charge the battery you need to turn the switch to the on position and then a red light will appear on the charger brick (it is now charging, fan will kick on). When the battery is done charging it will return back to green.

The switch needs a constant power supply of 5v or 12v. A UBEC may be your best option.

Also, I do not recommend modifying the battery or taking it apart.. Big sparks and safety hazards persist.

No worries on that topic :).  Just checking if I could do the switch thing.  Other than that I shortened the power lead cables, and I will have to resolder the power charge cables after I mount the charge port.  Looks good so far though.

If it is not delivered in 15 days I can file a claim. That's why I added the extra insurance on everyone's package. I tried to match the value of goods, but could only go up to $500.

You get less cooling but more protection from debris. In my tests I found no difference in the temperature of the motor.

@Surfer mentioned that it would be nice to have a pulley cover for the motor mounts. The wholes are there for them already, just never made them for myself.

So what do you guys prefer, I can put up several styles too.

There's plenty of clearance inside for the pulley and mounting hardware of the motor. The pulley cover bolts on with 2 M4 X8mm or 6mm socket head cap screws. 

So what I'd like to know is which one(s) do you prefer or they all about the same or you dont really care its just the cover.
There's 2mm of clearance between the wheel and the cover. The plan is to make a 84mm version for 80mm kegels, then 87mm version for the 83mm flywheels, 94mm version for 90mm flywheels and a 101mm version for 97mm flywheels. Just want to see if you all want more boxy or curved looking covers. Once selected I'll upload the covers and the motor mount, as well as a version of the mounts I made for chaka's 5064 motors and DIY's 50xx Series as well. These current mounts fit all 63XX motors.

All of these are 3mm shell thickness

**4.5mm fillet**

Just installed the 10s3p enclosure from @psychotiller very tight fit but it works. If it was an 1/8" taller the fitment would be perfect  the BMS makes the fitment tight I believe. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/c/cc8dfa80db345f23e14798e1d0be517e615c787e.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Not sure, depends on how you choose to ship it. UPS is going to be expensive but will take less. USPS will cost les but will most likely get lost.

get lost ? wuut?. well in that case doesn't sound like an option. UPS + the 299 wout amount to how much ?

Edit: ahh you are located in US, damn. that will be expensive..... Why is there not such a thing in Europe .(

I would say max 399 total, hopefully less. Shipping would be muuuch cheaper if you go with the 3p as I can fit it in a much smaller box!

I think I might purchase one. How easy would it be to cut one of these battery packs open and reposition the bms to reduce the profile?

If necessary, you could but you would need some pvc shrink wrap to close it back up. You also void any/all warranties by doing that.

But yes, it can be done. But I do not recommend it unless you know what you are doing.

After a call to USPS and a 2 minute talk to their billing department before getting **hung up on**, The package was only covered for $50.00 of insurance. 
Appearantly **it was our fault for underinsuring the package and not their fault for losing my package and failing to fulfill their service.** POS's

I am going to need you to file a claim now. If I call again I will piss on them even more. Or if you have the receipt that says $200 of insurance I can use that. I'm being told the package only has $50 insurance.

Hey @JLabs i wanted to know if it's possible to charge the batteries with a 4amp charger? Would it damage the bms or battery? Just asking because i have a charger rated for the same voltage just higher amps wondering if it can be used incase of emergency

Quick question about the battery from the group buy, or batteries in general. 

I received my 10s3p about a 3 weeks ago but have not charged or discharged it since receiving it. Could I possibly damage the battery by doing this? I probably wont start working on my build for another month and just want to know if its okay to let the battery sit for that long.

Generally it's okay unless it's for extended periods of time, try to keep it around 38v. If it's not there i would just charge it a bit until it's there. Damage will only be done if the pack goes under 30-32v which is not likely.

The percentage meter reads 19%, so that should be safe right.

If you hit the button on the back it will switch to voltage mode and give you a precise measurement.

Quick question for you folks... anyone who was in this gb, how are the flywheel clones holding up? IMO they road 20x better then my Otang Kegels... So smooth, but do they last?

I only have about 50km or so on mine so far, and no previous build to compare to, but so far they are holding up! Now that the weather is nice here, I expect to be riding nearly every day, so that 50km will rise quickly :sunglasses:

Great, be sure to let me know. I'm debating whether or not to place another order. They are certainly smoother than the generic clones purchased off of eBay.

Also where do I download the Software, can't find it anywhere.
