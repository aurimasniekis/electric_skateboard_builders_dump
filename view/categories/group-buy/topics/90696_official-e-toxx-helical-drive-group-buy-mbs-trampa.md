HEY GUYS, 

I have been trying to put this together for a few months now, the official E-TOXX helical drive group buy. I have worked out a deal with the Most Kind and Skilled @Nowind for his BADASS Drives and not just the regular gears, the helical gear upgrade is a standard on GB kits.

Now, If you have been on the forum for some time of just a few months I know you have seen a kick-ass build with these drives on it. Trampa or MBS helicals are not cheap and the quality of the drives are second to none. Quality materials and skilled machining speaks for its self.....
 

We have worked with Jens and come up with 7 kits that can be purchased in this group buy.

Ok, with the price you see above it includes shipping directly to you from e-toxx when ready.

We do have a MOR (minimum order requirement) 

PM me with your order choices for final prices and invoicing email. Please include your name, forum user name, the shipping address, email, etc. If you don't want to post personal info on the forum please email me at cory@hyperionsystems.org.

MBS, you can do all the rockstars and 5star hubs, 7 and 8 inches, not sure about the 9in tires. trampa hubs as well. 

Trampa drives will accommodate the superstar line, Im not sure what tires are available with trampa,  Jens has adaptor plates for some. He is offering a either/or on the gear ratio, 1.4 or 1.5

I will check compatibility of wheels tomorrow when i have some more time. 

right now.......

Sorry about that, I must have missed it. The last few days I haven't been able to respond much, due to a sick child but im back in the shop the rest of the week and im hoping to pull everyone together on the etoxx deal. 

If you have some guys wanting some drives please gather them up and we will make it happen.

If to watch it with voice, my all day favorite is the moment when the bearing falls out + the happines which follows after.:smile:

Every time I go back to the ettox website I come back to the conclusion that it is a hefty price. 
I hope I get my motor mounts pulleys etc sold. Then I can order this ettox set :see_no_evil:

Ok, I have been completely swomped at the day job and family stuff. I want this thing to go down and we have 2 weeks to pull it off. to get the prices described above we need 14 orders and not all the same item. so it can be for 14 of any of the sets detailed above. 

Looking at his website again they have added some cool shit im sure can be added to the GB. 

I was not expecting this to be a fast turn around GB, hell I dont think they exist.  I did, however, expect it to take some time, patience and effort.

And with a holiday at our door again, getting sick of being told when to celebrate, it will help us solidify the ones really interested in a drive.

So to help with the collection (some have emailed with request) if you have followed up if you haven't sent one yet do so now to Benjamin at benjamin@hyperionsystems.org and you can be added to the invoice list. once we hit our 14 unit goal (money collected) we can place the order, all orders will be shipped directly from Jens to you, no middle man that stuff, No.

Just an FYI on the group buys we do. They are not done through the business website because we dont profit from it and it would be considered a loss in profits in the books. So we use Paypal invoice as goods and services so everything is protected and all fees are included as well as shipping from Jens direct to you. Once you confirm your order via email to Benjamin or me we will send an invoice notification from paypal and this will be your tracking and receipt, the invoice number will also become your order # for jens so shipping info can be shared.

Unfortunately, you can be awesome until you aren’t.  I hope they come through for you

I think we're fine ( I'm in this buy as well, in addition to a complete build) 

Their 'lack of responsiveness' is the only issue I have with them, but it's unavoidable with someone who only does this on the side. I've heard it's been quite a busy week(and weeks prior) for Ben and Cory between family and work so we just have to have faith 👍

I know I'll get it eventually :P

Sorry guys, We have been dealing with a few things, day job has been slamming us, Benjamin has been juggling a lot of work in the Caribbean  and its time consuming and communications have been none existent on some of the small islands. It's not paradise when you go there to work.

The GB

The group buy has changed several time over the last few months, From the original numbers of 10-14 down to 8 then 6, so some time has been eaten away dealing with that. When we started this we had in mind that the group would be small and easier to complete, but with vertigo hanger shortage, to people changing their minds, and going back again and again to Jens with a lower number. 

Website

Yes, out site is down pending 3rd party mitigation over ghost orders ( orders placed on the site and monies captured (PayPal) but the order closed and archived before the order was filled) 8 of those, plus the almost 1$ increase over all other shipping rates, 2 bank charge backs (fraudulent orders last $ and product totaling $1500 that the system didn't catch (we pay for fraud protection) refused to cover because it was over a month old) and finally the Maytech motor GB we did ended up costing us a bit. We replaced 9 motors, before the damaged one was sent in. Out of that 9, 1 was sent in. We also lost a shipment of 10 chargers from china. 600$
And unfortunately we have been affected by the unity shortage so it's not been a great year. None are excuses but just circumstance and we deal with it. 

We have struggled with what to do with the website, weather to use a different platform w/similar issues and cost or combine the use of the 3 things we utilize the most (forum, PayPal, and social media) Wed pages do not cost as much as a platform that takes payments, orders, emailing, shipping, etc. We discovered that usps, ups, Fedex charge on average 1$ less than platforms unless you pay for the biggest package. 
Volume, from the beginning we wanted to supply reasonably priced parts and batteries, builds came in later (custom). In order to survive using platformed websites is volume. When you don't sell a product that can be produced in volume it is difficult to reach the #s. 

We don't scam or cheat anyone, we are just like everyone else trying to make something of our passion (esk8) and most sacrifice a lot to do so. 
We think the changes we are going to make will be a better fit for us, we strive to deliver the best possible product at the best price. In order to do so with out the volume we have to trim everything that is a waste, and maintain what we can do now. In the future there will be more opportunity for growth and a movement to selling complete builds gallery style ( like a theme build or something we have wanted to build ) show case them on a website and continue to stay low key. Until the time is right.

Benjamin and I have worked hard to deliver a quality product from motors to batteries, we back it even when it cost us. We would like to think we have help bring change to some small aspects of the industry and as we go through our trials, we have deep understand of other in the storm. This forum, users, and industry have taught me patience on a level I didn't know existed. I have witness all the melt downs and bashings and delayed products that drove people mad. 

 We will continue to build the best battery possible, partial builds, complete builds and  take orders as we always have, from the forum or word of mouth using PayPal and social media. Our Webpage (gallery with contact info)  will be up in a few weeks once we have gathered a good amount of Customer pics and we have a ton to sort threw ourselves, parts will be limited to a few different sizes of motors and some escs, battery builds and customs builds.
