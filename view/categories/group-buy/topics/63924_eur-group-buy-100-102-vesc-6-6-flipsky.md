Like this. They will also work with out the switch, so if you wanted to use a Vedder on a duel setup. Just leave the switches unplugged.

Yes, we have done extensive testing of the flip 6.6 units. Both units. The fully enclosed and the one pictured above with just heat sink. 
The fully enclosed unit was tested in Vermont and in Texas. In both regions north/south USA the units showed higher temperatures during normal  operation more so in hill climbing. In the north it is less due to climate. Texas heat and humidity punish anything sealed or partially sealed. Then you add an enclosure, it creates a heat envelope ( double ) with no ventilation. 

Now the stand alone with fined heat sink. 
That unit is geared for a more hot humid climate. It preforms well inside an enclosure and doesn’t have the overheating issue. It also makes it more size friendly. 
Once you get setup and the correct version of vesc tool it’s like most esc units. The true test will come in longevity and of course that takes time.

It’s not necessary to use both 12v. But as you can see their engineers supplied the diagram. 
It’s only to engage the function and as long as the switch it’s self ( pushbutton ) is rated for 24v it’s not a concern.

That’s a great question. One I am having trouble giving reasons for Esther way. 
It really boils down to preference. 
The anti spark switch function on the fsesc6.6 is bypassed if no switch is plugged in. Note the switches they supply are dinky and feel fragile in your hand. 
Space would be a factor. 
I like being able to change a fuse if it blows. So that’s one for a Vedder or external switch. I also like a bigger pushbutton switch compared to what they supply. ![image|375x500](upload://3xlJBX2snsltuq4uI1km5atui8Q.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://8hX121XI55yYr59ivh4erkGJ7Gm.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://f0QwO10Kl1XuPPM471xkLcWK9XD.jpeg)

Most are duel rated. AC/DC
 The 12v denomination usually is for the led. 
Most pushbutton self latching buttons are 5-10A/ 30-60v DC. higher for AC

I have not tested the limits for the ERPM. 
And I’m not aware if they have removed it all together. 
But I will ask the rep. 
For the switch I believe so. You will have to wire it differently from standard because of it being 4 prong and 3 wire. I have some pictures of the switch they use and how it’s wired. I will post for you.

Guys, 
  From my perspective in the industry of esk8 diy I can honestly say that flipsky is coming strong with products that will rival that currently holding top spots. I say this because flipsky  listen and learns on this forum what people wanted and made changes. That is the way to approach products that are still being developed for the esk8 industry.  Excellent customer service and response for someone. Listening to your intended customer base and being able to make changes that don’t take forever with the ability to produce these products will set their place in the industry.

OK.

So far there are 59 units in demand.

I was thinking I split it into batches of 20~ so its controllable for me and just lower chance of things going wrong in general.

I have plans on placing an order sometime next week.

But I need to find a way so that I can split these numbers up.

Should I make a google form or something similar, and the first 20 that fill out the form and pay are included in the batch.By this I mean, you fill out form, and then I send a paypal request for the funds.

So first come first serve?

Also I need to verify paypal fees. I think 100 euros should cover the first payment.

Secondly, there are  people who are ordering more than 2/3 pieces, are you really comfortable in using untracked shipping? When I go to the post office I will have proof of postage, that's it.

Done! The only thing if you can figure it out whether the ERPM limit is gone. That would be great. Which is gonna be the final price since almost 60 units are gonna be ordered? Maybe we can get better quotation... 60 are quite a lot. Even just the push button included or some additional discount. Thx man!

A lot of small payments might Trigger warnings even more.
and In the end It's just the total sum of the month.

(Tbh 20 by 20 just sounds scary, coz some people here wanna buy 5. and then you'll have confusing numbers like 22)
```

---
## \#57 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-08-07T21:15:47.314Z Reads: 217

```
The discounts don't go down by much. If I order 51 its $90. Yes I know that eventually 60 are going to be ordered but I don't think they are lenient on those quantity discounts. I will do some convincing but in the end it is only $3 

Maybe I can get the button included for fractionally higher - but not everyone might not want that, but as I said I am probably going to order using 20 batches. 

Final price is yet to be confirmed its going to be like 102 euros though.

I made @DeathCookies be my little test, and he overpaid by 2$ per vesc just because of paypal fees. But in reality I charged him 100 euros but after fees it costed him 103.5 euros a vesc. Because I charged him $116 him because thats what 100 euros is.

So I will reduce that down a couple dollars so maybe $113.5 and that should be whatever, the next person who pays will absolutely confirm the price. 

@Blitz thats why I said around 20, it might get stale and it might be difficult getting to 20 in the first place. Which isn't really a issue. As for warnings and such, I am not worried about that I just want things to be managable. If it goes over, it really doesnt matter too much either

@rey8801 I asked them about that, I didn't get a proper answer. They said
> Our 6.6 can reach 150000 ERPM

150000 is plenty though, thx

The push button was just an idea in order to get a bit more out of the deal. Not mandatory for sure. About the order of course do as you feel more confident. Although I order big amount from China for different purpose and for custom doesn't matter whether is 20 or 60 since is gonna be a slightly bigger box. What will change is that you will have to pay the fixed custom fees 3 times instead of one if you order batch of 20 each time. Different is you think that 20 can go through outside the "radar", let's say :rofl:

I'd sell 2x LM5109 based VESC 4.8 prototypes (100v driver so no overvoltage error + single sided PCB FETs so it is damn easy to put a heatsink with thermal pad or else on the back of FETs, basically a workhorse if handled properly) + custom ported Ackmaniac 3.100 FW, for starter. I need to check what's next. Maybe a 33.6v 6A charger but I might keep it for now. 

One VESC is brand new unused, logic board and powerboard need to be plugged (via the included cable or via soldering the headers together) ; it has the old 2.18 stock FW.  

Other VESC (my test unit) is assembled and loaded with Ackmaniac FW.  But I messed up a bit with it when repairing a resistor I blew with the iron tip... USB port needs either reflash with ST-Link V2 or I blew the arm processor (don't think so though). 
Before that it was properly detected, did spin motors and responded to commands through VESC-tool. No error led blinking and power led is running stable, hence the USB reflash theory. But I didn't verify that myself. 

Both controllers provide Boot and Reset buttons physically (and the "damaged"  one does responds to reset button). They're from Rogier Wolff (rew on Vedder's forum), he runs BitWizard.nl and is a helpful guy.

There is one thing I‘m interested in this group buy.
@moon do you take any commission for all your work?
Don’t know how other people see it, but I think 2-5€ added on each esc to honor your time you spend for communication, repacking, labeling and sending out to us wouldn’t hurt any of us.  
What you guys think about it?

Why we can not pay with a bank transfer and save the fees. So you can add a bit more for you. I know that PayPal offers more protections but they seem have a good reputation.

You have to check your ratings on the pushbutton self latching. Most are duel rated. AC/DC the DC is always lower. ( for the switch) 
Usually printed on the side or bottom around the prongs. 
Now for the LED. Witch is rated from 5v- 24v also indicated on the side of switch housing.

You can order at the end of the month, so in other words yes, but your order isnt included in this batch.

So basically if you can I will order for you. Since you can only pay at the end of the month I can only order then. I can't front the money for people for obvious reasons :slight_smile:

So should I cancel the invoice ?

Fill out the form again when have the money to order. Thanks

Now..

@rey8801
@rob.in.space

I sent you an invoice, but I have cancelled it because there is a chance Paypal will put these two payments on hold too. I dont know if there is a way to check

Don't know what to do. 

Transferwise is a possibility but only just made the account and waiting for verification. Or I can carry on with these orders and then hopefully by then all those stupid paypal issues are resolved or decide to use transferwise

@rob.in.space you might have to wait since sending the cost of 4 escs friends and family might not be the best option, depends if you trust me.

And then wait a week for delivery. A couple days for processing on my side

No issues @puuhapet thanks for paying. Not to say it won't happen again but a good sign. I think they put a hold last time because I must have issued about $1000 of invoices and they all paid very quickly :sweat_smile:

Paid. No issues. 

Shipping from warehouse Wednesday. Out of my control so don't moan :slight_smile:

Fedex shipping 5-8 days. DHL 2-7 was slightly more expensive so chose the cheaper option

Package insured for $2000 (cost $12 extra so why not)

@akira I will PM you about the payment now. 

Thanks guys

Thanks @moon 

Sorry if this has already been asked. If no button is connected, and the vesc gets power, does it then start up like a normal vesc ? Or do we need a button  together with this flipsky vesc, to get it going.

Is it to late to join this batch, if i fill out the form tonight ?
```

---
## \#171 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-08-10T11:21:50.763Z Reads: 117

I think the answer is

You dont need the button to get this working. If you don't have the button - which no one has since I didnt order it the vesc will operate like normal
```

I have seen that diagram. But i dont understand why nothing happen, when you mix two supplys together in one parallel connection. If one 12v supply fails in one vesc, what happens then to the other ?

On my understanding the supply wire is for the led to work on the momentary button. By using one rated for 24V instead of one at 12V you will be able to get current from both the VESC. I do think that get the current from only one is plenty enough. I think that if one 5v line from one vesc fails then the other one is enough for the momentary button to work just fine. @hyperIon1 what do you think about it? Thx

I will just make a direct connection between the two vescs not with a connector in met ween. I do not see the reason to have another connector. Anyhow I picked it up this one.

I liked that it's only with the circle and not with the to run on sign in it. 
I got 24V although is still not clear to me why they get the current from both of the VESC and not only from one.

I should already have the JST connector to the VESC but ti be sure @hyperIon1 do you know which 3 Pin JST it is? PH?

Hola! Does someone known how these VESCs handle temperature. I know they have a heat sink but I would like to know the temperature range. I am testing new hubs and I get the vesc temp up to 75^C, while with the same setting with my previous hubs I got 55^C at most. IT's also true that this hubs pulls way more current even if the setting are the same. Thx

All packed up.

10 Canbus cables, 27 ESCs, and my personal stuff all came nicely packaged.

Import bill wasn't large so no complaints there.

Starting to run out of tape but I am sure I have some lying around somewhere.

Next thing is to start printing shipping labels

This is so weird - I bought the labels for basically everyone but theres some languages such as german which have letters ( ß) that have obvivously confused the system.

Printed labels for most people except @Andy87 since post office is going to be closed until tuesday, and when you buy online they expect you to send it the next day I am pretty sure. So I will buy your label on monday.

Hi,

The tracking for most people was automatically sent to their email (I am assuming so because I hadn't sent some people tracking and they already had the tracking links)

I advise that you track on a computer since the mobile websites hides information

Is this correct wiring for the switch? The ESC had no connector and the green and blue were soldered together in the pcb. When the ESC is on the output from the switch connections were 12V.

Still have to make it but this what I have https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eur-group-buy-100-102-vesc-6-6-flipsky/63924/40?u=rey8801
In the schematic they take 12V from each vesc when I would rather cut one 12V wire. Therefore you need to use a 24V push button.

I believe it was a crappy switch and people didn’t show to much interest. It’s great for a single set up. But when doing duel it clouded issues. 
It can be reversed and a switch added. I believe everything is still there component wise. Just no jst and the pins are jumped.

Guys, you can simply use a loop key (cheepist) 10$ or Luna switch 35$ or a Vedder 35-45$
After examining the units I have. It looks like it’s just a matter of wicking the solder bridge away and soldering in a jst connector.

Guys I am at the time to decide whether use the built in anti sparks. I was wondering is someone using it on regular base? In case of dual vescs, did you use a 24V switch and wired to receive 12V from each vesc or you cut on the 12V wire? To me it should work as well. Thx!

Hi man, sorry to call back this question, but I was making the push button. I followed you diagram and the one on Flipsky website .

![image|690x487](upload://93HWb4olDAWQnEx1eeMWHJDrPaZ.jpg) 

I used a 2KOhm resistor since I am going dual vesc and a 24V latching type button.

I see that on the Flipsky diagram the C and negative are connected, whiel I do not see it in the picture you posted above.

Here my wiring. Do you think is correct?

Moreover I used a button that holds the position once you press it. Is it correct or should be on thst always came back to the original position?

I’m pretty sure it needs to be a latching type switch. 
Monitary only makes contact when you push it. 
Self latching push button stay in contact.
