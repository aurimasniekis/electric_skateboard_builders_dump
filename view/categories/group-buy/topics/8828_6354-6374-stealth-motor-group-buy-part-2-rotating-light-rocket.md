After the overwhelming response on the last 6354 / 6374 group buy, I have another 35 6354's available. They are going to be the same spec as the last buy, but **with silicon wires!**

So here are the specs again:

190kv sensored 6354
180mm **silicone** power wire length / 180mm hall sensor wires (120 degree)
4mm bullet connectors
8mm shaft with keyway
0.2mm stator
N42SH curved magnets
NSK ball bearings
30mm AND 44mm mounting holes (works with TB and Enertion mounts)

The silicon wire added $2 per motor so the price is $61 and the shipping as follows:

**1-2 Motors: $6.80**

**4 Motors: $13.45**

**International: $57** (max 2 motors, message for more than 2)

If you want to see pictures and up on the first buy:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/59-6354-6374-190kv-sensored-stealth-motor-group-buy/7955?u=jlabs

Message me for PayPal info. Make the title like this to make it easier: 'Forum Name (x#of motors) Ex: JLabs (2x 6354)

If there is interest in the 6374 let me know, there will be limited stock. If we go over the 35, I may be able to get more if they are not sold out. I have 35 reserved currently.

It was not worth the additional cost. Gonna stick with the 4mm. The motors come with female bullets.

$61 per motor, it went up $2 for silicon. 

$61*2 + $6.80 shipping = $128.80

Male connectors are soldered on the motor wires, and 3x female 4mm bullets are included in the box. So you get a set of male and female.

Semi-off topic. For those of you who have changed out your connectors before, do you usually remove them and resolder the new ones on, or do you snip the wire and solder on?

## \#22 Posted by: JLabs Posted at: 2016-09-03T18:11:16.428Z Reads: 287

```
The only difference is the bullet connector size, these motors use 4mm and DIY uses 5.5mm. $61 compared to $90. That over $30 savings with shipping

So, you would just have to solder different connectors on (if wanted). In my experience all of my ESC's have used 4mm. And if you are using a VESC you can solder on the included female connectors.
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: chris.hunt Posted at: 2016-09-03T19:03:18.159Z Reads: 280

So the VESC DIY makes is 5.5mm connectors and other companies make 4mm ones?

yea the vesc i just got from diy had 5.5mm, i cut them off and put 4mm bullets because thats what all my motors have.
 i think my first one didn't have any connectors.

Our motors also have an extended stator, upgraded retaining rings as well as a few other modifications so bullet connector size isn't the only difference. But these motors are a great deal nonetheless.

@chris.hunt - You could just solder an adapter to change 4mm to 5.5mm as well.

Basically just buy this

pop out the wires that come with it, pop out the wires on the motor, and place the wires into the new header. I find it easiest to use a pin to help pop out the wires. You need to make sure the order of temp, 5v, and gnd cables are right.

This was what i did but with a 5 pin header instead. 6 pin should work cleaner

**I also have some FVT 120A 6S Sensored esc's, and some 12s 120A non sensored esc's**. Let me know if u want to pick one up and I can ship it with your motor.

## UPDATE:

Motors arrived today! I have tested them all and have them repacked. I also have most of the shipping labels printed. If you did not receive a message with your tracking send me a message and I will give it to you. (You did not receive a message because of an improper name). Here are some pics:

How would these compare to the rspec?

As someone collecting parts for my build would you think the 6355 would be enough for me being 225lbs on a mono build or would the 6374 be a better option?

with that weight it will lack torque with the 6355. Always better to get the big motor if you¬¥re riding single drive.

Yes, what @TarzanHBK said. A 6374 would suit you much better.

Hey, if you guys don't already have mounts for these I could make one if you send me the hole pattern.  I can make one in all aluminum or aluminum clamp to calibers with a 3/16 stainless arm. I'm currently making them for 50xx motors here [motor mounts](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-mounts-45-00-free-shipping-ollin-and-30mm-dia-hole-pattern/9859/9)

If you did not get your tracking # message me. They should all be sent, or I am sending right now. Also, I was testing the motors and came across this..

They are just surface scratches, nothing affects the actual performance. This is what happened to only *one* of the 6374's. If you bought one and would not mind receiving this one let me know. I also have a new 6374 left from the last group buy if one of you would like to switch out. But to be honest once it is mounted you will not even see it. I also contacted the supplier and they were overly apologetic, and said they would send a replacement if wanted. Any way, I need a 6374 er' to nominate themselves and either swap or claim this motor.

I've been eye'ing your mounts and @JLabs' motors when/if he does another group buy. If you guys worked something out for the mount bolt pattern, I'd be more inclined to purchase from both of you. :wink:

Ok, 74's should ship tomorrow. All of the 54's were dropped off at the post office. 2 - 3 days (from tomorrow). Also for the 74'ers. I just received the FVT 6s and 12s esc's. Let me know if u want one and I can ship with the motors to save some monies. Here is a quick picture.

No, it is from a different and more reliable manufacturer. It is the same product that @ajaynagra linked. Price for the 12s is **$115**.

I though diy opto 12s was the same as maytech. 
What makes this better than maytech? 
does it have a programming card and throttle curve calibration? 
Does it have the same overheating issue as maytech?

No, DIY does not sell anything from maytech that I am aware of. The esc is more reliable, it has almost zero failure rate. It does come preinstalled with esk8 firmware (throttle curve). It does not have over heating issues like maytech. Of course if you run it in an enclosure with no ventilation at max throttle it will get warm.

I just double checked using the search on this forum and its the general consensus that Maytech is a rebranded FVT 12s and both suffer the same issue. How do you know they are not the same?

I think you are talking about the sensored variant. This is the unsensored version. If they were not reliable then DIY would not sell them and more people would be complaining.

I beg to differ. DIY will not sell bad or unreliable parts. If he does then he has to issue refunds and his reputation of having quality parts goes out the window. Trust me, I know what I am doing. I would not sell these if they were junk, because all that would do is hurt my reputation.

I use the 12s ESC from torqueboards and it works great! Are these directly from FVT as the airplane ESC and then you are loading on esk8 firmware?

I was using DIY 12s opto esc's non sensor. 
They worked good  but then I tried Vesc and the Vesc imo is better than anything else out there. 
Best throttle, Best brakes, most efficient.

Vesc for a street board, TB 12s opto for an EMTB

I've also used this esc on a street build before, and it really is good: just not as good as the vesc. 

For the mountain boards though you need more power on demand, and if you use a vesc you will have the risk of blowing the drv, overheating, and going past the 60amp limit. 

@barajabali (super reputable member, makes hella sick custom batteries) will tell you the same thing
