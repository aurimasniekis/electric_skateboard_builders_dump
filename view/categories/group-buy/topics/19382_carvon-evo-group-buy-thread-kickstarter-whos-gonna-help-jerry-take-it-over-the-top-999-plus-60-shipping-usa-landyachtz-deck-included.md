Are these including the Landyachtz board? Also is shipping included in the $999 price?  Is there a spec sheet of the equipment being used?  Delivery date?

Some pics with the Landyachtz EVO deck and Shred Lights. The built-in wedging on the EVO wedges your front truck 15 degrees and de-wedges your back truck 15 degrees. The wedging in the front adds turn to the truck, while the de-wedging in the back adds lean â€“ the result is increased turning in the front and increased stability in the back.

I've always enjoyed my Carvons but I did a little mini review if you want to know my thoughts on the V3's which are technically dual direct drive rather than hubs.

I'm currently riding the v2.5 and it's fantastic. Smooth and very responsive. Minimal resistance, consistent power, and fewer failure points. Given Jerry's history, I have no doubts that the v3's will be a substantial upgrade.

I have 4-5 eSk8 builds lying around, so when I got Carvon v2.5s from Jerry awhile back they sat in a box for months.  I was not sold on the hub motors alternative (had one build but the torque was really lacking so sat on shelf), but wanted to give them a shot.  Now that I installed them recently on a build and rode for a few weeks, really wish I had done that beforehand!  The torque is way more than I expected, even with 97mm uro, and top speed not lacking either (even though lower KV than v2).  This sold me on hub motors being more of a future than I had anticipated, as I had tried them for more off a stealth profile in NYC.  Direct drive even more so, I expect the Raptor2, Carvon EVO/REVO, Ollin Direct, Hummie, and other next generation hub/direct drives are going to change the equation so worth trying.  I urge you to find someone local to borrow/trial, they really need to be ridden to experience!

It's funny, people are worried abt the torque ...and it pulls like a freight train on duals...

And def beg a try on someone's board if you can it's an amazing ride

Actually that is a good, point...one time one of my hubs wiring dropped and I had to ride single hub, really showed me the big difference.  Same speed roughtly, but really weak torque acceleration in comparison.  I am 190lbsb btw so really do need dual, but was surprised at the magnitude of difference on torque, so caveat there on single.vs dual.

```
It's a huge difference...I know there are are a few nay sayers out there...prob because they had the higher kv motors....and yeah un-sensored with a high kv....not a good combo for anything low speed.....but the 2.5 version really gives it a nice rush of power that you can feel....
And now with the addition of that replaceable wheel thingy ... it makes it really sweet ... no need for proprietary thane...I guess that's the deal breaker for me on all the new hub motors out there. For me it matters, for others it don't.

Deal of the century.  Raptor2 is a deal as well at these price points. Will be interesting to compare the new completes once delivered. Even the ACTON 4wd will be interesting to some at same price points. Gonna be a fun summer for sure either way.

OK. You convinced me. I just added the extra 100$ to my pledge for the Landyachtz EVO deck.

BTW: I might be in for a group buy in EU. I could save the extra 100$ for the deck, if I understand that correctly.

@Pantologist nope I don't get paid for this, I just enjoy all things video + technology :+1:

@caustin thank you sir!

@Papperlapp I've been a fan of Landyachtz since my Dinghy deck and the EVO deck is a really well thought out design. I tried Venom stiff bushings for speed runs and soft for the carving and the deck performed admirably.

I'm worried most of them aren't even doing proper testing...Either way they're like one time use boards since spare parts are impossible

Just in case anyone needs a little extra encouragement/push, please read the update from this past Tuesday:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/carvonllc/carvon-next-generation-electric-skateboards-longbo/posts/1836767

I changed the highlighting of the first paragraph below as it applies more to this forum.

**"We no longer will sell the V3 motors and any other DIY parts** so that we can concentrate on building your boards.

If you notice, we also have increased the **retail price of EVO to $1999 and the REVO 4WD to $2999**. We wanted to change the retail prices on the Rewards section, but could not edit them because someone pledged already. So if you know someone who is interested in our CARVON boards, pledging in our Kickstarter campaign now would give the most discount."

He's fully funded and doing me a favor for all of you ...

It's a big savings off what he has it retail and can pretty much bet that this is as low as you will see it for a long time....

@skyblaster hit me with money out of the blue...that's cool...

If your in...then do as he did and shoot me the funds...as soon as I get 4 in (I will cover @Blacksheep till he gets back) I will hit Jerry to re-activate the KS pack and get it 

If let's get this done for your guys!!!!

For the individually purchased units from Kickstarter, now at $1199/each, I don't think they stated who makes the deck.
This group buy however uses a Landyachtz EVO deck. From the Kickstarter campaign you would need to add $100 to get the Landy deck.
