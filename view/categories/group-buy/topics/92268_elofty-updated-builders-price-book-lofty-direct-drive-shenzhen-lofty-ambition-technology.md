> “_In China, when you’re one in a million, there are 1300 people just like you._” - Bill Gates

**April 30th update - new price list, below thanks @Winfly and Kenna**  

China is the world's hottest market right now - and is widely-predicted to remain the fastest growing major economy for the next decade, and beyond.

We believe that our entire community benefits when we introduce you, our builders, directly to prospective suppliers in China.  

When we all work together, our products will be better, safer and more cost-effective, for all our riders and their fams.

Yet working with China can be hard, and _especially_ when facing language and cultural differences.  It takes trust to build a true business and stuff moves pretty fast over there.  It can be hard to keep up.

We're trying to advance things and connect you guys in, directly.

We've taken the hard part - negotiating a price list with a Chinese supplier in Mandarin - and posted a B2B price list with small-batch discounts for you, below.  No glitzy pictures, this isn't marketing - this is a business-to-business introduction to introduce you to Lofty, so you too can benefit from your own contacts in Chinese esk8.

In full disclosure, we are not compensated by any means for making this introduction or negotiating this pricing for the community, and we've bought everything we have at the full retail or eBay price.

We're just customers like the rest of you.  

You order from Lofty directly, you pay Lofty directly, and you receive goods from Lofty directly.  All pricing includes shipping to your door, and everything ships immediately.


Credit goes to @Winfly for leading negotiations in Mandarin, supported by testing from @mishrasubhransu, @sofu @landonkun and others, community leadership by @BillGordon and to the rest of the team in the eLofty thread, elsewhere on our forum.

Finally, this special "Builder's Price Book" **is only open until Wednesday, May 15.**

Here's the supplier contact information:

* Supplier name: **Shenzhen Lofty Ambition Technology Co., Ltd**
* Supplier contact: **Kenna Yan**
* Contact Phone **WhatsApp/WeChat/Skype: + 86 134 1186 8423** (corrected thanks team)
* Supplier website: http://www.elofty-skateboard.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=60 and https://lofty-skateboard.com/collections/direct-drive-motor 

To order: please use WhatsApp, WeChat or Skype and reach Kenna Yan, directly.  (No we are not babying you with a form - go meet Kenna and build your network lol).

Kenna is super nice so introduce yourself on WhatsApp, tell her you're from the Builder's Forum, order what you want from the Lofty menu, and pay with PayPal.  Your products should arrive in a week.

Without any further ado, here is your special pricing that expires on Wednesday, May 15 for the Lofty Direct Drive:

* retail supplier catalog is on their site, above
* **all builders receive 30-ct. pricing, even if you buy just 1 item, until May 15th**;
* if any category goes into 50, 70, etc. you will recieve the difference credited back to your account towards your future Lofty purchase;
* the drives have been tested to 58kv
* axial, Kegel-compatible, TKP or DKP only;
* newest generation - improved epoxy for better impact and heat resistance;
* integrated temperature sensor;
* 3.5mm bullets (comes with female bullets so you can swap if you are not using a Unity or FOCBOX)
* optional DKP baseplate (drivetrain hanger works with your Independent TKP baseplate);
* 85mm or 90mm "Boosted Lunar" wheels (cheaper in bundle) - 90mm strongly recommended
* "extra wheels" means additional set of wheels packed with your drivetrain order (saves shipping to buy +1 wheels)

Price list expires May 15:

![image|603x353](upload://uNSJv3mQ0aW1fuJiZWaekGNLspv.png) 

To provide you an example of my discount for what I am purchasing in this buy, personally:

**2WD + DKP baseplate + 90 MM wheels** means:

* $499 retail (on Lofty's site)
* $469 direct on eBay (direct from Lofty)
* **$417 in this buy**  (direct from Lofty)

If, by some miracle, Lofty sells 100 drivetrains by the 15th, I (along with everyone else who purchased a drivetrain) will receive a store credit for $22.

(what we call a true-up in B2B pricing).  Pretty simple.  

For the entry-level TKP drivetrain for $279, you will receive the drivetrain hanger with motors; you will need a TKP base plate.  

Here's @mishrasubhransu's solution that's proven durable:

## TKP setup

I paid a total of $22 for all the things needed for TKP setup.

1 X [pack of pivot cups, bushing and nuts](https://www.skatewarehouse.com/Thunder_Bushing_Rebuild_Kit_100D_Black/descpage-TUBLBU.html)

2 X [base_plate](https://www.skatewarehouse.com/Independent_6_Hole_Baseplate/descpage-IN6HBPL.html)

I want to say thank you, again, to everyone from the https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/elofty-direct-drive/77910/1060?u=topcloud thread that made this journey possible.  Every piece of information, good and bad, helps us all.

We're thinking about expanding this to two more industry-leading companies: Xinda (China) and walking you guys through every step it takes to make your own decks and enclosures, and Tay Guei (Taiwan PRC) to show how custom motors are made.  AEND for wheels (Texas) can be on the list, too.  

If you think this series about showing the business aspects of esk8 and dealing with suppliers is interesting and valuable, please let us know below.  

Go forth, esk8 moguls. :) Thanks again.

Does the DKP baseplate become TKP if the part in the middle is removed? If that's the case there is no need for an Independent TKP baseplate.

Since RKP is not an option and many people's decks will not work well with DKP can someone summarize the implications of running TKP in this system? For example, you read a lot about TKP not being stable at high speeds, does it apply to this? Also, using truck angles is one able to make the TKPs be stable and carvy at the same time?

@topcloud Great job on presenting the information and thanks for organizing this. I have a couple of comments:
1.  I wonder if people would want to know where to get the independent baseplates from. The setup below worked for me. 
2. Also the 2WD and 4WD pricing is inconsistent because the  4WD is priced higher by $10 when compared to 2X 2WD even though the 4WD package doesn't have 2X front trucks. So people would just buy 2X2WD and throw away the two front trucks. Lofty would also have to bear extra shipping cost which can be avoided. I guess it would be in Kenna's interest to reduce the price for 4WD by removing the cost of extra shipping and the price of 2 front trucks + $10. 

## TKP setup
I paid a total of $22 for all the things needed for TKP setup.

Correct, my friend.

The wheels are more expensive when sold alone, only due to shipping.  The price difference between 85mm and 90mm is only $1 or so.

These direct drive motors work with all > 90mm Kegel-core wheels.  My personal favorite 90mm Kegel core wheel is surprisingly the Lofty wheel itself, even moreso than the Labedas.

ABEC cores are not available... yet. :)

Do you know anything about their 105mm airless wheels? I'm curious if we'd be able to get a deal on those too. I'd love to try them out on one of my belt builds. The Skullboard 105mm wheels felt like a great size, but the hubs just didn't have the power to push my big self around.

Ahh damn! Thank you for letting us know. I'm raring to get these on my hands, but rather have temp sensors and 3.5 bullets. 

I'm still interested in the 58 Kv version though, as I'm going for a 4WD build with pneumies. Will the next batch still be 58 Kv? Will there be a group buy? I don't want to overload you with questions for Kenna, so let me know if I should talk directly with her.

Thank you for the amazing job!

Just an heads up, but I’ve been using these DD for a while now. I’m roughly around 300 miles and I think they’re fantastic. They super solid and I think the standard KV is perfect. Good torque and decent speed. I wouldn’t get one with higher kv.

Quick update:

* 58KV with temp wire is under production and is available today, at the above cost;
* new and different KV will be available at $20 more, yet will take them time to produce (TBD)

Thanks again to everyone who's contributing knowledge and experience, here.  Appreciate you guys.

[/quote]
To further clarify, they(KVs different from 58) will be available at the cost mentioned above only if the the Minimum quantities is hit, if not then it will cost $20 more than the advertised price. 

As for different KV, she(Kenna) said that 58KV is good for hill climbing and braking. It's apparently a lot better than with 75KV in 2 wheel drive configuration as per their tests. That's the reason they settled down on 58KV. A good balance of speed and torque. 

That being said, @Winfly, is looking to order a 75KV sample to see what setup it will work best with. Wing, anything you want to add?

Production of current 58kv will be done at the end of month. And to clarify, we can only get 75kv Elofty if we order at least 30 of them. Not accumulative with 58kv Groupbuy. I'll see if I can get Kenna to send samples

Top speed without sag:. 
58\*42\*3.14\*0.09/60=11.47m/sec= 25.6mph

Rear world speed will be lower based on battery sag, current draw and charge %

Wouldn't using 36V (nominal) be more realistic? Then there is also efficiency (85% works out well for me):

`58*36*3.14*0.09/60*0.85`= 8.359308 m/sec == **18.7mph**

I'd be happy to be wrong but this method gives me pretty spot on max speed figures on belt systems.

Hitting 85% of the bench speed in the real world with a load would be ideal and occurs with a motor sized to the load but this will perform under that percent with the big wheels and small motor.

Since my other board made some trouble with random jolts, I took the plunge and threw together a board with leftover parts and the e-lofty direct drives. I ordered the drives with hangers and 90mm wheels.\
I wanted to use them TKP and ordered Independent trucks, sadly they are not a good fit. The Pivot pin enters the pivot hole just a few mm because of difference in geometry. @mishrasubhransu has a photo of this on his build thread. Then I ordered chinese Gullwing DKP clones which look completely similar to the ones from e-lofty. Even with those you can not just remove the top hanger to do TKP. Again geometry is different and the pivot won't stick properly. I ended up using them DKP. I swapped all bushings to Riptide Kranks and now the trucks are stable and carvy. Not all bushings will fit because of odd sizes used from the Chinese manufacturer.\
Sorry I don't took pictures because I was in a hurry.\
Today morning I gave the drives a 20km spin with Boa 100mm wheels. The Drives are dead silent, quieter than any hubs I used.\
With 20A -12A battery 60A -80A motor they perform ok but torque and low speed brakes are a bit weak. Somehow I have to admit that DKP with good bushings are more fun than I thought. And the Boa wheels are awsome. 
I will drop a Metr. Record for reference. 
https://metr.at/r/ws2dx
The record says 43km/h topspeed with a 10S battery but I doubt that. My Wh/km usage was 18wh so for me the efficiency is average. But the  Meepo hubs would consume the same with 90mm wheels.

They fit somehow, but the pivot pin didn't penetrate enough to make me confident. 
With the Independent baseplates you can only use street bushings because of the short Kingpin, even with the yellow ones, 98A I got wheelbite. With good downhill bushings DKP is more stable.\
We have to find a fitting TKP baseplate with a long Kingpin.

When I find time I will take the hanger to some shops here to see if there is a fit. Replacing the Kingpin for a longer one to accommodate for taller bushings is easy.\
I am going to raise motor amps to 80A, battery to 25A and see what that does regarding torque. With the Boas the ride is buttery smooth and a huge improvement compared to other chinese hub board offerings.

I have used it primarily like a hub motor upgrade and maybe that's why I like it so much. Others coming from dual 6374 builds are probably right that it doesn't compare, but at $300 it's hard to argue against it as a value upgrade/budget build candidate.

Reasonable expectations are more frequently met.

The Goods:

* New motors will come with motor sleeves? For protection. Not sure how they look like yet.

The bads:
* Somehow their engineer insisted that adding temp sensor will mess up the motors so they won't be adding it. 

So to sum up, new batch of 52kv will not have tmp sensor but comes with protective sleeves and 3.5mm bullets.

Not significant but it's good to have. They will be using higher temp epoxy this time (I assumed, because she said they worked securing the magnets and temp resistance.) So if things goes well it should never be hot enough that Vesc will need to throttle down to protect the motors.

However, at some point I noticed one motor stopped working. I just opened up the board and noticed one of the solder connections came loose on that motor's phase wires (I had swapped to bullet connectors). I soldered it back on, but that motor still doesn't work. I have verified that it is not an issue with the ESC. Any ideas what else I could try here?

Kenna is insisting the 58kv will hit 30mph (48kmh) on 10s

I am not so sure about that, but I think I will just give them a try. 

Maybe down the road I'll try the 75kv too and then just sell the drivetrain I don't prefer of the two :)

Do not want to affect your judgement but 60Kv won't get at that speed on 10s. I have used 60Kv meepo hubs and they got about 43kmh 90mm 12s. Now I am using my DD and they are 75Kv and at 12s 97mm I hit above 55Kmh. With 60Kv motor you will need 12s and larger wheels to get there. To me if you want higher speed wait the 75Kv version.

Just for reference that I am not guessing values :grin:

Maybe you have to check the main thread. I think people report like 40kmh on 10s. Like @BillGordon @DAddYE @mishrasubhransu have them already I believe. I just do not want you to be disappointed on the speed. Kv and speed as you know are really connected. maybe with 12s and 110mm wheels will get up some decent speed. @Winfly could give it a try with a charged battery.

On mine the motor efficiency I find predicting better the real speed is between 90-95%. If that is the case for this DD too, then with the setup just mentioned you should get around 45-46kmh, not bad.

I am really confused now. I  am supposed to having the 58kv version, bought them before the group buy started. I just gave them a spin on the bench and the Metr. gave me those readings.![Screenshot_2019-05-15-20-28-03|281x500](upload://vdoSPuaNQPjlhgyVy6ZKwvI9Zr1.png) ![Screenshot_2019-05-15-20-28-25|281x500](upload://aOuI2Kzooy09khyfjgRMAfcRgZe.png)\

It's not 100% in line with what the calculator says but close.\
I do hit easily 40km/h with them on 10S battery but thought maybe the 18 pole count is incorrect.
![Screenshot_2019-05-15-20-48-30|281x500](upload://t1NvFWqdKgPRzp89EtaRlZTKb9v.png)

Edit* I must have the 75kv version and the calculator is used with 75kv, 90% efficiency.

I think you definitely got the 75Kv. Same values I get so... I think that if you stay with < 110mm wheels 75kv is better. For AT the lower the better.

Yes, even with the 100mm Boas they get warmer then the 60kv hubs I used. 110mm wheels with this drives would be too big for me. With the 110mm wheels Torqueboards Direct Drives are the best match I guess.

do not want to say that it is not true but are you sure the metr settings are correct? I see you use 10s and 50kmh is a bit too much also for 75Kv. I was getting that speed with 90mm wheels with a 110Kv motor. Maybe double check the poles count ecc...

Yes I can confirm with 10S, 20magnet poles in Metr. and 100mm wheels topspeed is around 40-45km/h ish.\
At a small decline or with backwind 48km/h might be doable.\
I tried them with 30A battery and 80A -80A for each motor and they got fun and torquey, but on hills 6355 geared setup still beats them.

Thank you @kenna for getting my order out so fast. And even tho one of the motor stopped working after 1 test run Kenna sent another one and was here in a week. Great customer service. 

 I got the 58kv ones and they got torque. I didnt test top speed yet but bench test from unity reads 24mph on 10s2p and 90mm wheels.

At this point, i am frustrated. A month later and I'm still out $300 with no clear indication as to when my product will ship. I ask directly and get vague answers... Why?

I guess what I wanna know is, is anyone else dealing with this? Or just me?

They also said they are getting 6 inch wheels soon. Kenna = good customer service but there's language barriers that make it difficult

I've ordered two drives but now Kenna is saying they cannot ship them with temperature sensor wires. :-|

Last week, Kenna promised that I would have the tracking number this Monday. I still haven't heard back from her until now. I'm getting pretty angry with how this is handled. I ordered and paid a drive with 58kv motors. I was told it would be shipped in two weeks. After to weeks, Kenna told me the 58kv won't be available. She offered 72kv instead and said they would ship "after tomorrow". That was on June 2. I hesitated but agreed at last. Now it's almost a month since when I placed the order and sent the payment (May 15) and I still don't have the tracking number.

yeah, I still want the drives, but will want a discount on that because I won't be able to get the temp. wire so that's what I'll be discussing with Kenna

Good to know I'm not alone. Really wanted a set of these so I hope it all works out. Do you happen to know what went wrong? Why they aren't shipping out?

Even @torqueboards mentioned some problem with sensor wire in his direct drive. Very curious what's going on.

I have a bunch of thermocouple that I bought for putting in my battery pack(DieBieMS would read those). I am thinking of jbwelding them on the hangar closest to the motor. That should give me a good enough estimate.

For Vesc to know temp of the motor, so it doesn't over heat and burn out your motor. Imo not important unless you are trying to race these direct drives.

Yeah, I've never gone out of my way to connect a motor temp sensor if it wasn't already available. There's very little chance if no temp sensor causing an issue, there's a large chance of cutouts at speed with a bad temp sensor implementation.
