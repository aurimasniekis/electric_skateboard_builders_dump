So, Mr @Hummie  has had a really nice looking deck made and is currently doing another group buy in this thread.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-wood-and-carbon-decks-group-buy/43245
There seems to be a little bit of interest getting some over here in the EU.
Myself I'd like one and will take another to build for a friend.
From speaking to Hummie, it looks like if we get enough interest we could get our part of the order shipped directly here for the original price (there or there abouts) Then there will be possible import duties and shipping from the UK. (or you could pick up or meet on a ride?)
I will be making an enclosure for mine and will sell and can send out with the decks if anyone else wants one. I'll make a single stacker version for mine but will consider fatter if there is enough interest.
So a brief re cap.
Pay hummie the money.
Wait.
I'll receive them, see if we get hit for import taxes. 
Split the charges and ship out at cost.
Option to wait again while I make an enclosure mould then pay for an enclosure and get it shipped at the same time?
Interest so far I think is..
@TarzanHBK
@ShawnyP
@L3chef
@stewii
@Jumpman
@bigben
There's 6 of us with a possible 8 decks I think so far?
I think this will be a slow burner but will be a great looking board if it all comes together..
Right, now off to pay for my decks.

Thanks for doing this!
I paid Hummie for 1 deck. Most likely I buy another one in a couple of days.

Sharing @thisguyhere 's awesome picks of the deck.

Planning mine out for rear dual 6374 using @psychotiller’s enclosure. You guys should get this beauty. The cut-out is basically half the height of an 18650. Looks sleek IMHO. ![image|666x500](upload://pZ6einUcYBMjruCCKNZTezw1RKH.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://ex3aXPn8rqbPTI3gEuzaEeiEgVr.jpeg)

I wonder if this deck would work with the evolve trucks and have enough space for AT wheels and not only 97/107s. Would love a deck with space for batteries and lots of clearance underneath.

one plus is the board is stained and not painted so if you wanted to sand down the head and tail for more clearance to get them to fit, if even necessary,  you could add a clearcoat afterwards and it'd look as good as new.

Giving the distance marked in red, I think ATs on Evolve trucks should fit. The trucks extend outwards and it looks like there is enough space for the 7” wheels.

![image|666x500](upload://7tzMLa55EJlzL7e84g1uD9eNWuL.jpeg)

I’m interested in one as well, just not sure about logistics... @Hummie  @bigben . If it’s $120 (plus any potential import fees) for one deck, and that price includes shipping to @bigben, I’m down for one. With a slim enclosure it would be a great deck.

not sure on the shipping cost direct to ben.  i'll ask them for the cost.  it should be similar if not cheaper with china closer to eu then usa, I think.
with the deck being stained wood you could get a power sander and sand down to make the wheel fit if you need to.  shouldn't be hard to put a new spot of clearcoat there and youd never know if you hadn't done it.

I think I paid somewhere in the region of 100 dollars for shipping 4 sets of wheels from Ollin boards to the UK.
Where are the decks from? These decks should ship direct from China and the shipping to me in the UK is included in the price. Shipping on to the other EU destinations estimated £8-£20 (crosses fingers)

That looks good. I'm almost 100% sure the deck will fit AT on evolve trucks. The trucks being DKP extend further away from the deck compared to normal RKP trucks. The wheelbase is longer and even if drop through mounted, the clearance should be there. If not, at least 107s should work just fine. I guess I'll find out when I get my deck in the UK.

Edited: where did you get that grip tape from? I need one in my life :slight_smile: (looks like stock GTX one?)

Getting close now...
If you all can send me a pm and let me know where you want yours sending and the PayPal you payed Hummie with so he can check. Then if you want an enclosure made or hang on and see what i make for them? There's definitely import charges but fingers crossed it won't work out too badly. I'll know more on Monday.
Then I can work out shipping and duties and they can go on their way!

As the decks have a slight curve and the cut out follows this, do prospective enclosure buyers think they have the ability to make packs with enough flex to take this up? 
I can make the enclosure have a flat base rather than follow the deck but wouldn’t look so slick.

## \#93 Posted by: egzplicit Posted at: 2018-05-22T08:18:48.562Z Reads: 277

Should be easy, packs should have some 10/12AWG wire connecting each parallel module to the next. That gives you loads of flex on the pack and keeps it safe in case pressure is applied.

I agree that following the deck shape would look way better and even give you a few more mm in the middle for more clearance. The deck plus a bespoke enclosure will make for a slim, production looking product. Looks are important:slight_smile:

I think it would work with a D150 bms bypassed for discharge. It’s only 70x50mm and I think there are 50mm available in between the focboxes and the cells of a 10s5p based on @bigben picture. A 10s5p is 450mm long a 12s4p is 432mm long so even more space between the focboxes and the pack.

If the enclosure is flat then that’s no problem but it’ll look a bit odd so I think the enclosures will follow the line of the deck. (A little curved)
So whether you opt to stick it to the deck or rest it in the enclosure it’ll still have a bit of curve.

If the enclosure is made from glass fiber I don't see a problem with securing everything to the enclosure. But with abs it's better to mount the hardware to the deck due to abs being somewhat fragile. Thats just my oppinion anyway..

The slim enclosure I have is kydex...I think? I velcro-ed everything to the deck and the enclosure is just a cover.

I've used ABS before with everything attached to the enclosure and after a while the areas around the holes start developing cracks, never doing that again. I can't wait to see the @bigben enclosures since those are so much more durable.

It pryed out pretty easily since I can get my hand to grip to the other half of the pack and I don’t seem to flex the pack while doing so. 

You don’t have to use too much, just enough to take weight off the enclosure if that’s why you are doing it.

So,
I've started making the plug for the enclosure. It will have 25mm of internal depth and follow the slight curve of the deck.
I've sent out 1 deck but am I right in thinking all the others want a single stack enclosure?
I'll pop a picture or two up when i get something half respectable.
I'm going sleek with no lumps or bumps for specific buttons, ports or gauges. I prefer all that topside.
It's been a little slow this week as I'm still in the process of moving house and setting up the new workshop and have a few other enclosures to make. I'm pushing the good nature of the boss to use the facilities at work so I'm hoping to be able to get a bit done over the long weekend..
The import duties came to a very bearable £6 a deck.

Not sure of the room in the routed out part, how much width is left for the enclosure flange? More than enough?

If so I'd like to tickle a little bit and fit 13s4p, so ideally the enclosure would be a bit wider than the actual board cutout in order to enlarge it...posdible or asking for trouble?

Hard to visualise, afaik it's 590 x 140 so stock you could not run 13s lengthways with a serious change and associated weakening.

I think the layout per your pic with 50 cells is the way to go

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hummies-wood-and-carbon-decks-imported-into-the-uk-eu/48322/90?u=banjaxxed

For 13s4p only 2 more cells needed in total. Trying to image how they would go together. There is some extra space beside the 10s bms you have but the 13s bms I have is about twice as long 

A slight ~2mm bump at the motor end would maybe allow for the bms to sit on the cells and allow pretty much all the regular cell configs?

I guess you used the wires for the board flex.  I ended up using lipo hardpacks but was going to do 18650 and found it fit with just strip of nickel or copper and with the 4p group all solidly connected and then between the groups of 4 having the strip bend around backwards and then out again to allow a bend point there.  I think its common isn't it to bend the strip 90 degrees and down the side of the can and back up again to the next p group?

Basically it depends on the timeline. I've bought an psychotillers arc v2 that I recieved a while back. But change my mind with the setup I planed, and now the enclosure is ~2cm to small for my build. So either I modify the arc enclosure or buy yours..
Honestly I would prefer a glassfiber enclosure..

No worries Ben, what would that look like? 

Presumably a dual?
Any sealing for that or simple channels?
6 wires or 8?
Was planing to run Hummie's hubs and as such no sensors (maybe an after mod)

I was going to just drill and grommet. Maybe some channeling with a Dremel router to further flush them in & probably use one of the channel risers coming from @Alphamail .

One drawback is space utilisation, unless you know exactly what ESC in use, the channels may not line up exactly, meaning the phases will need to bend and the ESCs would need to be pushed away from the back of the enclosure to allow for that.

I think I'm good actually, just a vanilla for me thanks.

But if not optional it's your decision and I'll get what I get & not get upset :)

At the current rate of exchange the decks worked out at about £90 after import duty going on what they charged last time. Then postage at about £12 depending on the service and if you wanted an enclosure from me I charge £45 for those.
All in about £147 with the enclosure.
I'm getting a fair few sent over so should be a reasonable supply.

I’ll be waiting for your payment instructions and look forward to the shipping details. 

I already had a deck here for a build but it just seems to be more and more work. Getting this hummie deck with a sweet enclosure of yours done would save me a lot of work and have a beautiful finish which I can’t match.

So, there should shortly be a google form..
In the meantime I'll tag the interested parties. Some will be left off because they're local or have set up the google form!

@Highwon
@rojitor
@WillzPro
@linsus
@sayekim
@Hatman30
@catweazle
@amazingdave
@L3chef  
@Eretron
 3 more to follow on the next post!

I apologise if I've forgotten anyone.
There are a few left so if anyone wants to jump on board let me know.
I have 2 enclosure moulds ready to go, The single stack gloss and the satin. £45 each   
I'm close to working out two other versions, single stack with phase wire shields, and a double stack version. (still a little way off with this one.) They will be £50 each.
The boards come in at £100 plus postage at cost at the level of service you request. (Cheap and cheerful or fully insured and quick for a little more.) I've stopped using Parcel2go as a service and found interparcel have been pretty good. Recently sent an entire board to Corsica for £18 (skipped the insurance..)
I have included in the price getting custom boxes made and miles of bubble wrap and tape. I got tired of the hours I spent last time constructing boxes out of tat!
These prices are based on friends and family payment which I'm not sure if that's allowed so they may have a slight increase to cover the charges?

Anxiously waiting for the google form to order the deck with the double stack enclosure and want the finish that gets it to me fastest. That would be the Superman finish right?

Damn that would be awesome. Anyone here in eu that can airbrush the Superman logo on it? One that sort of fades away into the enclosure.

The double stack will be a little slower.. Still need to get it made and prototyped. Airbrushing on the enclosures is good with car paint as they are fibreglass. Just key them up, prime them and you're good to go!

So @Moros has done sterling work  on the Google form. This is all new to me so bear with me.
Here is the google form, this should make things easier...
All the enclosures will be made to order, the wire channel single stack and the double stack have the moulds still to be finished. The decks are ready to go, I would assume most people would want the decks to be shipped with the enclosures?
The prices are as if I was being payed in F+F as this is close to what they owe me. For goods and services payments (what I believe is encouraged) please add money for the relevant fees.

This was made for a mate of mine who wanted a complete flat deck.
Because the enclosures are fibreglass the first gel layer and subsequent layers can be pigmented in almost any colour. I'm set up for black but do have access to some other colours and can source at cost almost infinite colours.

Do you have pictures of a full set?
How does the enclosure get fixated to the deck? Are there pre-drilled holes and wood inserts or do you use something else or is it DIY and up to me?
Whats the weight of the deck and enclosure?
How long is the deck in total?

Hi @Maxid.
Sorry I've had my first day back at real work today and it's been madness...
I use furniture inserts, normally M6 and about 10 per board. The bolts I use are normally button head dome.There are fancy fairing washers that I have used on some boards but don't have a good supply of them currently.
The foam I use I get from a supplier who cuts it to size but some use draught excluder or door strip?
The board and enclosure don't come pre drilled but it is something I can do with time.. (a commodity I don't seem to posses..)
The deck is 1015mm long.
I'll just dig out some photos.
Don't worry about the questions, I'm snowed under so might seem a little slow, I don't mean to be!
Ben

bigben uses M6, no flange, softwood.

psychotiller uses m4 no flange hardwood.

m4 looks kind of tiny, but psycho attaches everything to deck. Seems quite strong enough, especially the hardwood knife thread version.

m6 looks gnarly huge :) bigben lays everything in the enclosure.

m5 -- ezlok doesn't do this size?

I'm tempted to use 10-32 to match the skate hardware. It's close to m5. I'm trying to keep all hex heads in metric only, so phillips or torx if I go imperial. madness... especially in my on-the-go toolbag.

I prefer truss head screws to spread the pressure.

Other tips from testing and from use. If you don't want to drill a through-hole for the insert, might be good to grind/sand the insert down a bit, so it doesn't have to go so deep. Epoxy the fuckers in, especially the softwood versions with the thick wings. I'm not sure about needing loctite on the screws.

The hammer-in versions might be good too with epoxy.

I've got m5 on my evo with everything inside the enclosure and not attached to the deck. Feels crazy strong with 12 screws. I'll probably go m6 on this deck however for convenience because sex bolts are way easier to find for that size tapered head (that's fender washers for people who don't want to be FABULOUS)

ive seen it done and maybe it was a thread on endless sphere.  i think it was pretty successful.  recessed into the deck and glued in.   but i think they did it will the magnets actually connecting and maybe glued to the enclosure so there wasnt material between the two that would weaken the hold

 i dont think magnets effect signals unless maybe right beside the trans or reciever.

Just a quick update. I’ve got most of the simple enclosures made but they need trimming. 
The wire channel enclosure’s mould will be done tomorrow. I’m happy with the plug now. The first mould I made I made to narrow. Possibly ok for some 14awg motor wires but who uses them??
I made a battery for my own board and got round to assembling it. 
I used a gloss enclosure. 
Surfrodz 
Sixshooters.
Focboxes. 
12s4p 30q
6374 motors. 
I drilled the charge port into the edge of the deck and passed an AS-150 outside as a way of a switch. 
Hm10 Bluetooth for battery level.

I took it out for very tentative ride. Did 4-5 mies and don't seem to have used much battery. 
I took it very easy but still seemed to hit 27mph without breaking a sweat. Very stable but stupidly tight carving circle when you push it. Just ridiculous.

I have a lot of trimming to do but when I've got that done I stick up some photos and do some billing.
Special shout out to my Dutch and Belgian brothers. Next Monday I will be travelling to The Hague?Den haag. Would this be any use for any of you for me to drop them off on route??

So I met up with @sayekim and @Surfer in Holland to give them their decks and one of the enclosures. 
We went for a blast along the seafront and had a chance to all swap boards which was really fun. 
Finally got a chance to try the raptor and some speed drives
Really great to meet you guys and see other builds in the flesh. 
Good luck with the builds and hope to see you guys again. (Forgot to say but probably going to be in Belgium a fair bit this Winter.)

Yeah it was fun and the deck looks great. Really glad I got it now just waiting for that double stack enclosure. 
Completely forgot to take pictures. 

Your board is a fantastic build. I wish it were mine. I’m very happy I got to try it and also @Hummie that deck is an absolute joy to stand on. It is so very nice and wide and the wheel base is very long too so I can get a very nice wide stance on it. 

I seriously have to consider a belt drive with 74’s. The torque is amazing. Best yet. 
 
If there is another group ride in Belgium I’ll be sure to join that and perhaps you’ll be there too.

Translucent more than transparent. I made a blue translucent one so lights would show through.
There are some very clear resins but it's the cloth or mat which spoil the optics. It would be possible to make a clear acrylic one though.

Polycarbonate is translucent n super strong but harder to thermoform.  I’ve seen it cold bent.

I just did a quick test with 12s7p, diebieMs, and dual flipsky 6.6 ESC, those are just boxes made to see the footprint of the elements...

I guess it's gonna be a tight fit with all the cables, remote receiver....

I don't know how deep the double stack enclosure is going to be, but maybe it is possible to stack bms on top of ESC, that way even an 12s8p could be theoretically possible...

The plug is made but there’s a little blemish on it so I want to re do the last coat. Beginning of next week should give me the chance to get the first one made. 
Then I can asses the exact space. Aiming for just under 40mm.

I have 12s7p vt6 and vesc 6 on this deck the only thing is my bms is the 150A from battery support was to big and I decided to make it on the top to the cell but with the bms you are going to use it should be ok 
I make my enclosure and is around 1,7 inch I think bc of the bms on the top to my cell

First double stack out of the mould. 
It’s about as slim as feasible. 
Still needs a little trimming. 
I’ve tested a triangular stack of 18650s and they fit with a little wiggle room. With a foam seal it should be snug with a well built pack. 
Sorry to everyone who has been waiting for these.

Do they use pollycarbonate? If they do and could make something the size of the enclosure that would be super cool! :sunglasses: :skateboard:  

I am reluctant to use a full enclosure because I can't see if any water got in after a ride. I ride in very heavy rain as I live in a tropical country and commute.  Water always gets in eventually. I would have to remove all the screws and check after every wet ride.  

I have been considering making my own polycarb enclosure but dont really have the space to build a thermoforming machine that big. 

The shape of your hummie deck enclosure is so sexy. I would buy a hummie deck just for the enclosure hahah.

As it rides at the moment it's actually ok. Pretty fast top speed but I feel that I'm a bit of a lump for them with hills. I think it would go pretty well in a 4x4 configuration.

Mines got a 12s4p with fat boy antispark and tiny bms. Works well with abec 97 or 6” nummies. 

Going to go large on the enclosure, make it 8p and add a diebiems.. that’s on 6” nummies only probably.

You remove the focboxes out the cases and attach the pcb onto the heatsink, with screws and thermal tape etc

Then you make a cut out on to top of the enclosure for the fins

And then make holes to on the enclosure so you can secure the heatsink with screws



Probably a good idea to have ben explain with pictures

Can you guys ping me a PM if you're still interested and if you'd like an enclosure and which one? Also What sort of shipping you would like me to look at, (Cheep and slow or fast and inevitably a little more expensive)
This is the interest list.
I have some enclosures made but I will inevitably need to make some more.

Only thing I’d do differently next time which won’t be too long from now, is to be sure to drill the holes at more of an angle. 
My washers aren’t completely flush right now but it doesn’t matter for the enclosure is sturdy as fcuk and tightening them down really hard doesn’t break it. You might here it crack a little but that is just the fiber glass or magic spice he’s using that’s giving way a little. 

I really love the strength of this enclosure and it doesn’t mind a bit of flex at all. 

Well done @bigben

Oh great. How much?

Who am I kidding, put me down for one.

I have the heatsink on my current build for the escapes but I haven’t cut the enclosure to mount it. 
The enclosure is too pretty to make holes in it. 
I guess I will eventually when the heat reaches us here in the summer. 
The escapes do reach over 70 if I push them really really hard now even with these low temps so it will be necessary I think.

Haven't done anything with the deck yet. Holes were just for phase cables, charger port and on off switch.

Phase cables seem to be the issue as they are sticking straight into the deck as I drilled at the wrong angle. I'll try and tinker with it tonight and if that fails I'll have one of bens.👍

Or do you think I'm best off just getting a new enclosure from Ben rather than trying to line a new enclosure up to mount holes on the deck later on??

Get one of @bigben ‘s  enclosures. You will not be disappointed, they are awesome and with the wire route version there’s no phase wire drilling to go wrong!

Finally got the Hummie deck thanks @bigben
The finish is Matt but feels more unfinished rather than a good Matt finish some imperfections. Is this how it's meant to be?

I will be applying some grip tape but not covering the whole lot, but for the areas that are uncovered I would prefer a nice shiny/gloss finish. Any suggestions??

Some love it but I was a fan of the gloss..

I think they are labeled wrong and are to be used for li ion. It says it balances at 4.18. Then again it does say 36 volts. I am sure you can ask them for a li ion version. 

Otherwise get this one and be sure about it.

uh too bad :confused: I think I'm going to wait because I wanted Hummie's deck for the "hole" on the bottom of it, to provide an easier build. It's gonna be my first build so I thought it would help. Plus the BKB is way too short for my riding style and I'm pretty sure that this landyachtz deck is far more expensive than Hummie's one ... If you had a price and a pic for the landyachtz (and enclosure) it would be very appreciated :smiley:

With 12s4p singlestack enclosure I wouldn't call the hummie deck an easy build.

Its a very very tight fit. Needs special small bms and you really need to nail the layout of charging port and on/off switch - charging plug and on/off switch in my build are not just randomly placed, it was simply the only possibility. In my case with the unity you have to deal with the motor to unity adapter plugs, short unity motor leads and I had to cut the cable tail short to even fit the truckplates of torqueboards direct drive... so a little bit of dremeling on bens awesome enclosure was needed. Turned out great though!

Maybe the switchblade is the better option for your first board.

In the end I'm planning on just buying a lot of cells and make my own battery packs to suit my needs because it seems pretty easy to me (I've got basic engineering and 3d printing knowledge so it's okay, I will find out how to do in time needed).
But the thing is that I don't really like the design of the Switchblade... even if Ben has it on a very nice price (it's the lowest I could find on the internet btw)
@bigben would you be able to make an enclosure for a 35" landyachtz Battle axe ? (for exemple, 'cause i didn't know this brand and the design is sick)
