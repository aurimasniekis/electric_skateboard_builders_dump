Hey Guys,

Would anyone be interested in a group buy of these awesome Steez remotes?

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f79e23512fa8122292989baf3ecabde24aa49be3.jpg" width="567" height="500">

Looking at about £50/$70 for the remote, receiver & silicone cover.

Just gauging interest but would be aiming for a target of 18 people, so pls reply if you want in!

Cheers, Jack

for an extra $40 usd, yes.

I would down for 2, maybe 3. Jason was spot on about these remotes. Never had a drop out, feels great in the hand, and throttle control feels great. Personally, I like it better than the torqueboards remote.

unless you can get them for 50GBP or cheaper it wouldnt be worth it.

You know what, If these were a reasonable price I'd get one.

as it stands I could have two nyko kama's or like 9000 GT2B's for the same amount.

@lowGuido £50 isn't unreasonable for the price of 2 GT2Bs you get a dedicated skate controller with cruise!

I felt that way also, but I said fuck it, i'll try it, and I don't regret it. Even for $110, its worth it. Battery life is like, 20 hours+. And it feels great, stick control feels way better at high speeds than trigger IMO.

But for $70? That's a good price.

Oh and most people are a lot less scared of dildos than guns! ...Maybe ;)

@Luke Not sure how its only 13% different for you, this is £50 Enertion's is £70 thats 33% and int. shipping from Enertion is like £15 so same as this. 

Just FYI I'm not trying to take any business away from Enertion or others, just trying to make this remote more accessible for people who don't have the cash!

i would but i JUST ordered a couple more for builds i'm doing. Next time!

Also these remotes rock! i love them. They take some tuning with VESC but once you dial it in they're wonderful, and cruise control is a little weird because its a signal loop and doesn't actually maintain speed on hills, but on flats its a lot of fun.

I have a video, but it's not very good. I'm gonna try to take a better one this weekend, and actually post a build thread about it. 

And so I have my numbers right, this group buy would make these $87 shipped to California? No chance the price could possibly go down any more?

Agreed. That's an actual issue these days. I painted my badwolf white for that very reason but I still feel like I'm getting looks. Then there's making the actual skateboard look less .... alarming.... with wires all over the place, bulky battery packs and small gauges with red digital numbers on them...

@Maxid I think the VAT allowance for Germany is €22 but I'm willing to turn peoples remotes on before sending them out as then they are used items and attract a lower market value, probably somewhere in the €20 region ;)

```
The biggest factor of how easy downhill breaking will be is the esc you use and the settings on that esc, and weather your using 1 or 2 motors. I never found it harder to brake, just accelerate. Think of it like this. the trigger is at 0 when idle and 100 at full throttle. If the throttles at 5, lets say on a slow board, that's 1 mph. On a fast board, that might be 2 mph. so at half throttle, you go 10 mph on the slow and 20 mph on the fast. But you need to get to that throttle position with some amount of slowness. You can't just got 0 to half throttle immediately or you'll get thrown off your board.  On faster boards, you have to be even more careful, as the more you push the throttle, the higher the speed the board will try to go. It's harder to accelerate on a fast board, as the ever so slightest movement may be too harsh of an acceleration that will throw you off your board. I've found personally, that I trust my thumb to do this more then my index finger. Something like losing the ever so slightest of balance often leads to a reaction of squeezing your hands in preparation of falling. You may of not fallen, but that squeeze of the hand will definitely make you fall with a trigger, as you will pull the trigger. If you squeeze your hand with this remote, nothing changes. These two reasons are why I feel safer with this remote. The long battery life, the fact its rechargeable, and the small form factor that doesn't look like a gun are added benefits.

Maybe something is getting lost in currency exchange but I can get the steez remote for AUD $123 delivered and your group buy gets it to me for AUD $148?
Maybe its the shipping that kills it

It's about $130 AUD which is only slightly cheaper than enertion, so I basically weighed up enertion's warranty vs helping out this group buy.

This is probably the best price australian's/kiwis can get ~$115 AUD shipped, but I just went ahead and got it with everyone else here

i just bought three of these on aliexpress for about $280. That's $81 each plus $37 shipping from bum-fuck china, so the per unit cost is actually about $93 at that point shipping included. The per unit price goes down the more you buy because shipping doesn't go up that much. One was $25 shipping, two was $29 but then 3 was was $37, so i think the carton size was playing a factor as well. 

Last time i ordered two and it wasn't worth it over getting one from Enertion. Ordering three made it worth it, but with split shipping to different addresses and things it probably will be hard to justify or even organize a group buy that actually saves money. 

if somebody is willing to do it, the best bet would be to order maybe 30 of them and have them all shipped to the same address, then have that person disperse them as an unpaid volunteer for the community and only charge the individuals shipping.

@jack when Ive done group buys Ive found the best thing for the individual buyers is to get the organiser to get the whole delivery and then the organiser to ship out to individuals. It doesnt make it easy for the organiser as theres all the mucking around. There is the problem also of if they are faulty. Ive only ever brought as group buy on items not electronic like car parts. Less likely to be fauliy if metal ans less parts.

Although postage from you to Aus may not be cost effective foe Aussie buyers. Anyway my thoughts. Good luck with it

I noticed they make 2 versions of the same model I have the old type with the a&b type buttons on the end.

I noticed my buttons didn't work after 12 uses or more. The switch mounted on the circuit board bends backwards when you press the B button. Which no longer works. I tried using some silicon gel inside to keep it from bending.

Will the new version pair with the receiver inside the skateboard? 

Can i buy another remote with receiver and will it be compatible to install inside my Steeze board?

Many thanks for the help.
