@mmaner, @treenutter, @mccloed, @Maxid, @DaviDjembe 

As most of you know, I had a bum batch of wheels come in recently. The bearing seats were milled incorrectly creating a slight wobble. Also, I made a shitty design error which made the valve stem hard to install. On top of that, the machine shop reversed key dimensions forcing me to modify the tire beads just to be able to make 2 sets available for mccloed and I to test them. 

The rides weren't actually that bad. For 6" tires they seem big and bouncy. Anyway, Several people are waiting for wheels so I thought I would offer up a solution. For $200 I will send you a set of my wobbly wheels. Why you ask would you want a set of wobbly wheels? Because They will only be interim wheels until the new wheels arrive. You're $200 would be a deposit on the new wheels. When the new wheels arrive, The balance for new wheels would be $100. And you get to keep the wobbly wheels. All in all, you'd get 2 sets of wheels for $300.  

I'm throwing this out there because it would greatly help me pay for the new batch of hubs and get you rolling on 6" pneumatics. There are 8 sets available.

Let me know what you guys think. If no interest, I'm still going to do another run, it will just take longer.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/f/df0bff8a13dc7b9f29b23f1642002dd11c096369.jpg" width="689" height="390">

How much more to add two additional pulleys when the 2nd wheel sets come in? Ending up with two sets of wheels, tires and pulleys sounds awesome. Also, how long do you think it will be before the 2nd sets are available and you'll need to collect the last $100+? The longer I can spread this cost out, the more likely I will be to go for it. I'm 98% there already, so you can probably just put me on the list anyway. Lol

None taken. I don't want anything changed or delayed on my account. I just want to know if this looks like it will be a 2 week process or 2 month process. Either way, I'll have to find a way to work it out. I've been wanting a set of these ever since I first saw them. I don't think I'll be able to forgive myself if I don't jump on this opportunity.

I run all kinds of stuff and sizes, the 42t pulleys make for a fast ride.  If you are going to be doing trails and hill climbs I would use the 60t. The pulleys have layers and can do 9mm to 18mm belts.  With 150mm wheels you should shoot for under 200kv and 10s. It's a sweet spot

Okay! I got all of the wheels put together, but since all of you wanted 60t pulleys I ran out. I only had enough for 5 sets of the 8. I'm left with a bunch of 42t pulleys. I just ordered more 60t and paid to have them rushed. I will get the other 3 sets complete and shipped this week.

@mccloed reminded me to let you guys know that the tires have all kinds of max psi's printed on them. Some of them say 20psi, 30psi, 70psi even 90psi! We tested them up to 30psi which was pretty firm. Above 35psi we had issues. (2 popped beads) I'm riding my wobblies at 25psi and they're nice. 
I sent them out today with 25lbs in them. 

I sent the first five sets in order of payment:

@mmaner USPS 9405909699938348999282
@Eboostin  USPS  9405909699937488085572

It would require some filing. Not alot, but definitely some. I put them on some buck trucks and what I did was put my hanger into the chuck of my drill press. Turned it on, and held a file to the hanger until it was filed down enough to fit. Needs to be an 18mm diameter to fit.

I sent them the way we run them. No inner flange. The motor pulley has 2 flanges so you don't need 2 on the wheel pulley. This way is much easier to change a belt or a tire. 

If you want the extra pieces let me know, but if you aren't going to run 15mm or18mm wide belts you won't need them.

Oh awesome!! If you have the 42t, 15mm pulleys, please send me two sets of those also and tell me what I owe you. I've already swapped one pulley plate over to make an 18mm pulley for my 15mm single drive setup that I stole from my old eMTB. Gotta say that I really like the modular, easily swappable design of these pulleys; 6 quick hex bolts and the pulley's off, with the tire and wheel still intact and inflated. You could probably swap a pulley in a minute or so, not that you'd need to very often, but it's stl nice.

I think these have become my new favorite wheels, even though I've only put <5 miles on them. They look AMAZING and ride quite smoothly despite the very slight wobble, which I can't really feel it when I'm riding. Gotta air them up though. Lol. I accidentally took my first run on them with about 10-15psi in them cause I forgot to check that first, and while they still felt like they rolled fine, my Lipo alarm kept prematurely going off when I'd accelerate too hard or maintain too much speed. Figured out that I had way too much rolling resistance from them being way underinflated, and it was causing excessive current draw and voltage sag for my little 5ah 6s battery. I pumped them up to 30 psi, and it feels smooth as butter now. Can't wait for round 2 of these things! So sick.

It's only fitting that these sweet baby pneumies start out life on my experimental Mini Monster Penny Nickel board. Might have to change her name from Penniclees to Percules now. :joy: She's setup temporarily in mini hybrid all terrain mode right now with one of my eMTB mounts and a custom molded mount by @hummie. I can quickly swap regular urethane wheels and a shorter belt on and use the second motor that's setup for it. It's totally ridiculous, but I love it! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Thank you @psychotiller!! :metal:

And yes, I echo what @Mobutusan said, thank you @psychotiller! These wheels/tires are art. The quality is next level. Can't imagine what the revised version will be like except for wobble reduction

Hey, 

I'm new here.. Been looking around for air tires since all the blacktop in my area is old and makes rides unbearable for me D: These tires are hard to find! But I really want some for my first esk8 build! Are there still some left or will there be another buy? 

(sorry if this is already said. I'm in a rush and wanna make sure I can get some!)

Curious if anyone has tried to balance these wheels with the stick on weights similar to what they use for car tires? The stem has a significant weight when considering the rotation. It may not look the greatest but i would choose function over form.
```

## \#113 Posted by: Eboostin Posted at: 2017-05-23T03:44:09.029Z Reads: 114

```
On the "wobble" wheels there might be enough room to stick weights behind the spokes between the inside cap.

I don't think the stem is the mainissue though. My understanding is that it's due to machining. Also, the tire inner diameter appears to be ground down (enlarged) likely due to the machining errors.
```

Nothing can be done to fix the wobblies. They are what they are. 

Promise you will be delighted with the new wheels!

Can't wait for mine they will be here on Wed , they look awesome. I brought up balance not because of the wobblies, just for the sake of...well having a balanced rotational mass. Probably not a big deal, was just curious if anyone tinkered with this. I probably will after a good run on them stock and report my findings if any. Im not questioning the sweetness of the wheels!

I bought a set of these wheel weights to fight the pneumy wobbles. They're light enough to fine tune the balance weight, and you'll never run out, hopefully. You could even share with your friends.
