**UPDATE:**
Clearly plenty of people are interested, so i'm moving this into the Group Buy category and will set up the product link this weekend and update this post with it. I'm kind of excited to see what's in them, although i'm pretty sure a lot of us have a pretty good idea already based on the comments. 

**ORIGINAL POST** (with minor edits)

![image|690x320](upload://pa82AL1EEPeS1uUFywa2NKPKWFn.jpg)


I want to know how many of you would be interested in trying out one or two of Maytech's new 100A VESC 4.x based ESCs with integrated heatsinked enclosure at a discount. 

Minimum order quantity would be 20, so i need some people. 

The point of this is to get feedback from the community so we can decide if it really is a decent part or if its crap. I don't have the ability to test more than one or two of these, so i thought maybe some of you would like to help me, and help the community in general make better decisions. 

Price would be $130 per unit plus shipping with a limit of 2 per participant, i would set up a hidden product on my shop and send the link to anyone interested if there is enough interest. 

anyone interested?

I might be interested in one or two, could we get some some more specs on them? Are they just normal VESC's with metal heatsinks or are they reformated and modified like the FOCBOX? Also I'd be putting them on my Hub Motor build so it would be a good test of the ESC's for hub use.

@JdogAwesome

Specs are as follows. This is directly pasted from the email they sent me:

> With high quality aluminum case, better heat dissipation
> Dust-proof and  splash-proof
> Compatible with sensor or sensorless motor
> Cont. Current: 100A
> Burst Current:280A
> BEC: 5V/1.5A
> Lipo: 3-12S
> Case size:  71.5mm(L)x45.8mm(W)x18mm(H)
> Sensored or Sensorless operation
> Great start-up torque with sensorless motors
> Soft-switching to reduce the losses in power electronic switches
> Separation of low power electronics from the high power electronics, make it more reliable.

The size is interesting. It would seem to be smaller in width than a focbox but longer, so i beleive this is just a modified 4.x form factor in an aluminum case. We won't know anything for sure until we all get our hands on them and crack them open.

I just came across a similar deal.  These flipsky VESC 4.xx look extremely well made, and they're $90 for the ESC alone and $109 for the ESC with a really nice heatsink.  They messaged me today and said they'll be releasing a HW 6 VESC this weekend for $188 and also be coming out with a dual VESC 6.

https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/aluminium-case-fsvesc

This Maytech looks pretty nice though... Both seem like pretty well built version 4's.

you are.  maytech 100a vesc supports 100a contant and 240 burst.  the flipsky is a regular v4 vesc w/o mod BOM so it supports 50a MAX.

```
just so everyone is aware.... because i keep seeing this here and other places...

EVERY "VESC BASED" ESC OUT THERE that is NOT a VESC 6 is BASED on the 4.x. 

"just a 4.12 with a case and some mods" is literally ALL of them, everything from this to the FocBox. 

The case is important, the mods are important. that's what differentiates the ones that blow DRVs on power up from the ones that last over 2 years under the shittiest conditions. 

The Flip Sky is a 50 amp solution. Every "50 amp VESC" i've tried so far died, but maybe that one will be better. Who knows. Also, sounds a lot like Fly Sky who oems remotes and eswitches and a few other things. Maybe its the same company using skate terminology in their DBA. 

The only reason this one piqued my interest is because Maytech has a habit of listening to people and improving their shit, while offering low MOQ on parts that upstarts like me can actually cobble enough cash for and try to get somewhere with. Also, i recently came across some 4.12s that were surprisingly stable and i have no idea where they came from, but i suspect they're Maytechs. 

obviously it takes more than a fat heatsink to make these better. I want to know what else they did. 

I'm going to move forward with this and get some more info from Jollin about what needs to happen.

...but apparently (as with the new Hobby King SK8 motor) we (yes, WE, WE, WE in this forum) are the only souls in the entire Milky Way with a deep interest in these technologies. "WE are the tip of the spear" sort of speak. Not only we bring to life, out in the open, technologies that been sitting there for a while without sparkling much interest from the community (any community, RC, Esk8, Drone, etc).

Thank you, truly, I really appreciate you saying that...  Been getting hammered with that kind of comments for weeks, and especially the last few days.

People want to see their options, and ask questions about something they may not understand.  I'm always respectful to everyone... so I'm kinda confused when people get mad at me for asking about a product.  So many members on here comment on more things than I do but they don't get hassled.  And I'm always meet with 'well what could you know you haven't even built one yet'  which I say I would have built one long ago but I've been waiting for all the parts to be made and ready to ship, so I'm being patient and learning all I can in the mean time. 

Anyway, thank you Hummie.   And I wasn't directing these comments at anyone specifically so please no one get offended over this...  I like everyone on the forum, this is a great community :smile:

Seems like some mods. Soft switch, I think it means like on/off antispark?

The second one reads like they split it into two PCB's, which is a big change. Its quite common for hobby esc's.

Can it run FOC reliable? :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

This is before shipping, obviously. 

The quote for 20 units just arrived and with shipping and fees it is $2594 and change. That means my $120 quote posted here will be inadequate to cover the cost of the units and will have to go up to $130. 

That's still a decent discount off MSRP, but it is more than originally posted so that may affect interest.

I created a thread about this ESC some months ago. 

Elieen from Maytech told me it was a 2-PCB design. 
So all FETs are on top and can be cooled down with a propper heatsink. 
Im not sure if with 2 PCBs and a heatsink topping a 18mm thikness they are actually using DirectFETs. 

Maytech does actually produce a kinda good quality, so I expect these to work fine, even on FOC.

Soft-switching to reduce the losses in power electronic switches

Separation of low power electronics from the high power electronics, make it more reliable.

Seems like some mods. Soft switch, I think it means like on/off antispark?

What @lrdesigns said. Is that a built in anti-spark?

Yes. It has a built in switch, its pretty clearly targeted at very basic BMS-less lipo builds or switchless BMS builds.

LHB have you gotten a chance to test this VESC yet?  Also what are your thoughts on the new info regarding the new Flipsky VESC 6?  They seem to have released new info, I'm curious what your opinion is on this item?  As they're offering them at $124 including aluminum waterproof case, if we can arrange a GB of 20 units, I'm very interested in how these may perform...

The dimensions of the case I find really unusual, since the vesc itself looks smaller then the current models, yet it's case is much larger at like 100mm x 90mm or something like that...  The current cases are like 70mm x 77mm if I'm not mistaken, and a dual is like 140mm x 77mm.  Still, I think it's worth investigating...

Some serious changes have been made. 
Just from the outside you can see mount holes, a real heatsink and the placement of of all jst connectors on the side of the unit. 
There is a anti spark switch added to this compact package and longer leads. 
I have had a chance to bench test set up. 
My poliminary report is the unit connects quick. Firmware update fast and easy. 
Detection wizard on the vesc tool no problems. 
This is the sweet spot. 
Most of us are use to adjusting volts or duty to gain proper detection in bldc and foc. 
NOT THIS UNIT 
I ran motor set up wizard in bldc and then when complete doubled back and did a foc hall detection. 
Both where fast and less agitation of the motor during the process. 
Set up remote and hums like a dream. 
In the coming weekend I will have it on a build for ground testing. I also have one going to a tester in the upper Usa to get a regional look at the preformance and dependability of the unit.

Like a champ. It’s new split pcb stacked design keeps it nice and tight package with excellent heat dispersion with the fins. 

Tested on a 6374 motor sealed 170kv ,10s4p pack, street setup in Texas heat. 
The motor temp was slightly higher than non sealed. To be expected. And the esc temperature remained steady increased on hot pavements and climbing hills but quickly leveled out. Esc is not in battery enclosure. ![image|375x500](upload://bLOZNWsmUsOtLkeRxLpdWarrP0h.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://a6mzM9pJ3cIQKvA4Kp4GT5Dnj1y.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://ke1ShQKdSnwjuQJEmzlOEwmCwp1.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://3u7MB6sMbMPnVMKxMQuFsXGoN0u.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://dPS23L34B1tKOYyFPky1Qtt7RkM.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://6fLT6YTZgqL7oS8Nr4xLNeBlo5O.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://9VUIckpS0SyWaPaqI64zAX2ba4B.jpeg)

Honestly out of the 6 new units I tested the maytech 100a set up was dreamy.
For real, I didn’t have to alter anything no amps or duty to detect in bldc and then after completing that doubled back and detection in foc.  Real smooth, only updated the firmware. 
The flips you have to install bootloader and update the vesc tool. But that was on the first units. They have installed bootloader at factory now. 
I have a unit being tested on a build and should have a report soon.

Correct, I’m going to put the maytech unit up tonight on the site. I just got pricing confirmation on those. The flips I’m waiting on bulk price sheet. 
But for comparison prices. I’m going to offer the maytech 100a will be less than focboxs by a few dollars. 5-10$ 
The flipsky peps are shooting high so I’m sweating them out a bit. 
But I think I can get them out the door at 160-165 and that would be for the fsesc6.6 with heatsink. The others are the tank 6.6 in full aluminum case and the clone super esc 50a. Those will always be the most affordable. 90$ ish

The Flip Skys we got are finally on a board. 

The problem with them is that they're so fucking huge I can't use them in anything. So i gave them to @jayx to put on his gigantic surfboard sized street deck. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl6uDmOgP96/?taken-by=theonlykindajake

underneath them is a box with a 12S pack he scavenged from old cells laying around. I forget what motors are on there, but its got Popocas on TorqueBoards trucks with my mounts. 

The brakes are really, really good. The acceleration is smooth and predictable, and it seems to be running 3.x software, i forget exactly which version. 

They're just too goddamned big. They belong on a go-kart or scooter or something. Maybe even a bike. A single drive board would work too, or maybe a pair of these sitting opposite sides of the pack in a diual diagonal config. But they don't fit in my shit for sure.

Yeah, they're taking pre-orders now. 


https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/flipsky-dual-fsesc-6-6-based-upon-vesc®-6-heat-sink

I think the heat sink version would be perfectly fine sized if one was to remove the xt90 and solder on normal power cable leads like normal.  I would even bet that you could request it that way, and without the heat sink, and someone from the forum could develop a proper sized enclosure/heat sink like @LukePL did for the ESCape's.  That would solve the size issue and give it a much better cooling system.

Plus, like with the dual enclosure for the dual ESCape's, you could just put two single FSESC 6's in there, so if one breaks, you don't have to send the whole thing out for repair.  Would actually even be cheaper than getting a Flipsky dual FSESC 6.  They're offering an intro price of $300 for the dual, but it will soon go up to $350, while the single with heatsink is $159, so two would cost $318.  Not sure why the dual is going to cost $32 more than two singles... I thought the point of getting something like that was it offered a bit of savings over buying two individual units... so kinda confused with their pricing here.  Anyway, if you were able to get a single ordered without a heatsink, and the xt90 for your power supply, it's possible they may even offer them for less, bringing them closer to $150, or $300 for two.  If you could get someone to design a case /heatsink for singles and duals, that would make them so much more appealing I think.  Plus they wouldn't be much larger in the enclosure then the current VESC 6, or the dual ESCape's as they are actually pretty similar in size once you get rid of the huge case they offer, or on the heat sink version, getting rid of the xt90 saves a few mm, lol.  Anyway, sorry for the long rant, lol, that's just my 2 cents :smile:
