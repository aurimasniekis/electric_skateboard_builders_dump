So I got a quote from BesTech [this](http://bestechpower.com/296v8spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D345.html) BMS. 53 dollars per bms. It is li-ion 8s 60 amp **with an e-switch**! The minimum order is 2 BMSs so I need another person. My plan is to buy both BMSs and to have someone buy the extra BMS off me for 53 plus shipping. Just want to ensure that I have a buyer for one BMS when I get both of them. Plan to ask them for an overcharge protection of 4.2 v and an over discharge protection of 3 v. US only.

Here is the bms specs.

I think the minimum order for all the BesTech BMSs is two. Shoot them an email. Can't past up the built in switch.

Bump it up to a 10s system and you will find a million takers. 8s is too low for most of us. Just sayin' dood. ;)

@Ulfberht @barajabali I sent an email to them yesterday asking if I could order one 8s bms and a 10s bms both 60 amp. They responded saying that this would be alright. They didnt include a price for the 10s 60amp bms though so I will email them again. It seems like you guys are wanting to get a whole lot more BMSs than me though so maybe one of you guys should arrange the group buy. I just need one 8s bms.

Also the reason I am only going 8s is because I have a tacon 245 kv which at 9s (if the cells are at 4 volts) would exceed the 60k erpm limit of the vesc. I should still hit 27 mph on my board tho so 8s is fine for me. I do have a lot of lipos but Im switching to li-ion cause I feel like I am babysitting those lipos. Still planning to go full 12s on lipos when the v6 of the vesc comes out so I can get some speed but sticking to 8s for commuting.

Okay so here is what I was think. I can just buy one 8s BMS for me and two 10s BMSs for you. Then Ill just ship your two BMSs when I get them. Or you could buy all three and ship me the 8s BMS. You are in the US right?

@jrpwit @barajabali when we did a group buy from Bestech previously, they shipped each item to a separate address.
