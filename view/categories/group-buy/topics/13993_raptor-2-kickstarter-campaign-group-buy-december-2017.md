## COMING SOON

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/668913678/most-powerful-direct-drive-electric-skateboard-rap

We were blown away by the success of the RAPTOR 2 launch on Cyber Monday & We are very thankful for all the folks who ordered.

**Unfortunately, many of our long term & loyal customers & friends missed out on the hottest deals...**

So we spoke with our business advisers & manufacturing partners to see if we can find a solution, the answer is simple, we are going to do a 2nd launch to compliment the first one & we will use the Kickstarter Platform.



----------


----------


We have structured the price to ensure that no one who has already ordered will be disadvantaged. In fact, we will be refunding $100 to anyone who has purchased at level 4 and we will be extending level 3 by another 100 units.

## **There will also be three new pricing levels!**

**These levels fall between LEVEL 3 & LEVEL 4 and are exlusive to Kickstarter**

## **(LIMIT OF 50)** USD$1129ea 
## **(LIMIT OF 50)** USD$1149ea 
## **(LIMIT OF 50)** USD$1179ea




----------


----------

## NEW: GROUP BUY DEALS

**We will also be offering group buy packs at the lowest prices that were Available in Level 1 & Level 2 as they sold out so quick** 

These NEW deals are;

## **(LIMIT OF 10)** 5X Raptor 2 Group Buy Packs $899ea = USD$4495

Yes I understand, there are too much of a hassle now building all your self when you can offer all round - all complete - all suitable - great bargain board, thumbs up @onloop . You offer almost the perfect all rounder on budget that DIY'ers cant match. My next eboard I create will use Raptor base config (cheaper - all done deal).

For now I'm totally into finishing my eTrampa board.

One last question: when you say you will handle multiple shippings for group buys, does it mean that you could ship for example 2 packages from the EU warehouse and 3 from the US one?
```

---
## \#31 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-12-01T00:19:29.193Z Reads: 230

YES, if there are 5 people, with five different addresses, they will all get sent the package from nearest warehouse.
```

---
## \#32 Posted by: SageTX Posted at: 2016-12-01T00:37:34.492Z Reads: 229

```
They why not just sell them for 899?  Seems like a lot of trouble for @onloop to do the group buy thing sending to different addresses .  
This could get a few first sale buyers tits in a wringer, who just tried to buy them up front for the discounted price and couldn't - then just settled for the higher price.
```

---
## \#33 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-12-01T00:42:45.511Z Reads: 231

```
we cannot offer the $899 OR $999 price on its own again, that deal was limited and we can't repeat for individual orders, however, some people wanted to buy bulk & they were restricted during our first launch so they couldn't do it & they were disappointed.

So now we are offering the prices only in a bundle format. You need to be prepared to hand over USD$4.5K to get it, this way the people who only wanted one unit & missed out on the super low price are not being disadvantaged.
```

---
## \#34 Posted by: SageTX Posted at: 2016-12-01T00:48:01.965Z Reads: 227

```
But if you are going to split a bulk buy order up for a group buy, why shouldn't I just find 4 other buyers, all cancel our orders, and re buy as bulk- putting the burden on you to handle the shipping? 

We'd save $1000+ cumulatively and you'd've gained nothing but a problem of splitting shipments
```

---
## \#35 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-12-01T00:51:48.070Z Reads: 220

```

For various reason some people complained they missed out, this is the best solution I can offer. It's up to you guys if you want to participate in buying the group buys or not & if you do proceed, one individual needs to be prepared to make the payment & organize the deal, So the burden is on the organizer.

I guess I got a little of track. I appreciate what you've done here, for your company and this community as a whole.  
I just thought the idea of selling them AGAIN at 899 sends a bad message to those who put up $ first. 
Your company - your decision.  
Cheers and best of luck. . Looking forward to my Raptor 2 for whatever price I paid.

Love the new design and particular the 90x80mm rear wheels!! 
Any reason the front wheels don't match the same width as the rears? would this not create handling issues? 
Personally, I think it'd look super cool to have the front wheels as wide as the back :slight_smile: 
PS you know what else would be awesome!? A drop through deck :smile:

Making the front wheel extra wide just adds extra weight, so we are just using normal width.
