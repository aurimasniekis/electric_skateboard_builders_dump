**Ok guys here we all have a chance to create a product just for eSk8!**
_For those that are not up to speed, let me give you a quick run-down_ :rocket: 

As per @Alphamail's topic:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-urethane-parts-manufacturing-of-your-ideas/41724

As per the topic Brad has offered to make us a custom eSk8 tunnel riser for $15 USD ea...

For those of you who do not know Brad or RipTide Sports they produce some of arguably the best quality skate bushings in the world, as well as pivot tubes/cups & some really cool foot-stops. From my experience of their product the thane pour quality is as good or better than anyone else in the industry, bubbles and imperfections are so minimal to be non-existant. 
As well producing a 1st quality product Riptide also supports skaters, events and now eSk8'ers like us through sponsorship or production of thane parts.
This last bit is important to me, RipTide are not selling someone else's product and they are active in our culture. Hell the reason MoeBro (@MoeStooge) got to ride his eSk8 (that Brad helped him develop bushings for) at Tepe & Taco was in no small part to Brads help.

https://youtu.be/R0Y0-aL2cmU

So If any of you are even thinking that one day you might like a high quality custom riser that can also route your motor wires and even a head/rear light through, **get on board now!**

Everything is already set up to make this happen, this will not be like those other unfulfilled group buys that are still undelivered 6 months later. RipTide have the ability and the runs on the board to deliver this product to us in a timely manner with 1st rate quality as this is what they have been doing for longer than most of you have been skating.

Now the nitty-gritty, the down-low, the dirty-details that will make this work :call_me_hand:

 >Everything is set up to do this, let me know if you have any questions. Just go to:

http://www.riptidesports.com/giftcertificates.php

>Purchase a gift certificate for the # you want X $15.00 each and leave a note that the $ is for the Tunnel Risers with your shipping address and the desired color using the FootStop colors as your guide. If the project is launched after 2 weeks, you will be invoiced for shipping (and tax if you are a CA resident) when the parts are ready to ship. Thank you for your understanding for us doing it this way but we are a bit risk averse due to recent events!

If by some crazy twilight reality we do not reach critical mass all gift certificates will be 100% refunded.

So basically this is a slamdunk, support those in the industry who support you, no risk money, but money down, and who knows what we will develop together next!

I am finalizing our target timeline with Brad now and will update this post when it is finalized for shipping dates.

the riser:

and picture of the colours available... this bit gets me, I think it is amazing RipTide are actually giving us a choice of colour!

Update:
[quote="Cobber, post:30, topic:57359"]
The group buy purchase stage will stay open here for 7 days, one week only!

After that RipTide will move to tooling and testing the products integrity for 1-2 weeks.

This means shipping will begin the third week in June and all risers will be in the mail by July.

No sorry Bro this is a short run custom pour by RipTide for us that is also available in custom colours (I find this amazing!). Something only a actual manufacturer could do. If need be if we get enough Euro interest we could arrange a Euro distribution point if other regulars want to help?

This is really designed for the end you want to route wires through so unless you are making a 4WD, or making multiple builds, one should do it.  There are plenty of good risers out there if you want to just keep the deck level with the Tunnel Riser

Maybe a yellow/green up front and a red/orange out back...

Thanks for pardoning my ignorance there! Hopefully this thread grabs you enough traction to get these made!

Using the tunnel risers on the front still helps if you want to run wires for lights, switches, or battery gauges.  Plus then they match.  And you can mod LEDs in them.

You know, it would be awesome if you had a generic front riser the same .51"  that doesn't have channels.

That way you could have a normal riser up front but matching in color/style.

I know you could still run another another tunnel riser up front, just seems unnecessary or something.

Ordered a couple as well.

```
Hey dude, the side of the riser with the 4 mounting holes is where the esc side of your esc/motor wires enter before turning out the smaller exit left/right at 90 degrees. Having the wires routed this way is clean and also reduces stress as they are close  to the trucks hanger pivot point. Lastly the small hole is for routing lights or mounting a led.

Thank you to those who have committed thus far, and to anyone else on the fence get on now why you can at this development price point.

The group buy purchase stage will stay open here for 7 days, one week only!

That's right people this group buy will be executed in under 1 month :sunglasses:

I recently bought a couple hundred dollars worth of foot stops, pivot tubes and tall barrels and I saved money compared to buying local. His $20usd foot stops were $40aud from  my local...
Compared to other US retailers I have found RipTide to be fair in the past.
If you put the number of foot-stops in a cart as you have purchased risers and get the website to calculate postage it should be pretty close ;) to what your postage will be.

i just got in on this too. I might ask them about some some other urethane parts too, i have a few ideas. I'd like to have my own risers that have particular features specifically for my boards. At the moment, i'm having to modify LUXE risers because they're easy to sculpt.

**Good news guys the "Group Buy" is live!** :tada:

We have hit the MOQ for Brad to tool up and make the risers.

With that said though, there is still quite a few people who showed initial interest in Brad's "thane Ideas" topic who haven't got on board. This "Group Buy" will not happen twice and in order for RipTide to deliver on the fast turn around of production/testing/shipping it is not fair for a lot of people to be let in late.

So get in now eSk8 builders, 5 and a bit days till orders close!

As a bonus for all the eSk8 builders who do get on board, as a _Thank You_ to the community RipTide (Brad) has offered free shipping on any additional purchases from http://www.riptidesports.com/# . So you purchase your risers @15USD each as per above. Brad will calculate the shipping and tax as per required and let you know how much that is just before shipping.
&
If you would like to purchase any more RipTide swag you can and Brad will cover the extra shipping you only pay shipping on your risers. Talk about a sweet deal :cake: 

Shipping Charges are as follows (Airmail):
U.S. - $2.66 to $3.10 (depending on how many ordered)
Canada - $9.10 - $14,00
Everywhere else - $14.00 - $23.00

Brad will quote shipping price for approval before shipment to everyone individually who has ordered.

Shipping will be:

Canada - $9.10 - $14,00

[/quote]

So that is $14-$23.00, for the risers and Brad will cover any extra shipping if you want to buy any extra RipTide swag.

That said If you get a group together and want a common shipping location, I'm sure Brad would be ok with that. We will just have to see what the shipping will calc. out to as it might be different to above.

We really appreciate the great response we have gotten from the eSk8 community for this community designed product!  The 3d resin printed parts are complete and are being shipped as we speak so I expect to have them mid next week.  Once they are here, I will make the molds and produce some test parts to abuse as we do with new parts to test for integrity and to insure the parts will do what we are asking them to do.  If they pass our tests, we go into production and begin shipping parts in the desired colors, if they do not pass we will cross that bridge if we come to it.  Assuming all is good we are relying on all of you to provide feedback both good and bad as we stand behind what we make and with your help, we will make it right!  Stay tuned here for updates with pictures as we progress.

Great, might go on the bushing help thread since I need some bushings too. I have heard great things from this community about riptide's great line of products.

I don't know how to explain it exactly @Erodrellyn,
Recently I changed out (up-graded to RipTide) all my Ronin bushings/tubes in my Ronin Katanas. They are set up directional with split angle/rake & width. 
On my Ronin bushings they would dive but it was kind of a bit wooden and then push me back up. The center was also less defined, which made them feel lively but also they needed more effort to control.
Now running matching Riptide Krank tall barrels all round with Riptide pivots I'm running flat washers front and back and just controlling the bushings with "krank"-nut pressure. The result is I have a better center and a deeper turn (now i'm using all the bushing), it's like I'm riding on gel, I can react fast but there is consistent and predictable feedback and the excess rebound is gone and I can control my lean angle better.
On my regular run I have a off camber corner that turns from down hill to up hill and my old bushings would always spit me in to the gravel off line (off the apex) if I hit it with any momentum soon as I hit any gravel. It doesn't happen anymore.
Somehow now I have more lean, no wheel bite, more control, a better center and combined with the "In-Side" footstop even in the rain bombing DH I feel confident :dark_sunglasses: :rocket:  

TLDR: I can't promise Brad can do this for everyone but now my boards have a more stable center, greater stability at speed and feel more carvey.

I was going to make the male plugs, not the mold out of Aluminum since they would cost about the same as 3d printed parts in the quality I was looking for.  Upon further research I found companies using the same machine and resin, the same job was quoted from $500 on the low end to $1500 on the high for exactly the same quality.  Did a couple of test runs for quality and found someone I could work with, so now we can launch more of these projects faster with our new source.  We pulled the trigger on this project before we had the MOQ to show good faith in the eSk8 world.

your motor wires enter through the large channel on the short side of the riser, then turn 90 degrees left/right towards the motors. There is also a small channel that faces front rear on the board so you can install a LED light if you like?

OK, I have an unconfirmed report that the member that spawned the idea for the Tunnel Riser has been injured as I have not been able to contact him, I have sent @squishy654 a test part and I am looking for three people in immediate need that can test the first run we did for fit, finish and functionality.  

**I have three available that I can ship to members that have ordered the risers already, recipients must be in the USA for faster feedback.  This shipment will not take the place of what you have ordered so no need to worry about the color we are shipping (Orange).**

Happy Fathers day to all the dads out there and to be fair, the first three that respond here that have ordered and are in the USA will receive the test parts!  Since you have already ordered, we have your ship to address.

Looks good dude, although as per above I'd watch the motor wire insulation with the riser flipped the way you have it. The edge of the base plate is often 90 degrees so with the truck movement flexing the wires against that sharp edge over time with a bit of dust and dirt that acts like abrasive you could develop a short there over time against a material that is conductive.
Leveraging against the _thane_ should reduce the ware and in a worst case is not conductive.

The risers are tight, and that's not a bad thing, they capture the wires well and they barely move but they do shift a little. I think you guys are correct, I need to mount them against the deck itself. the risers could be longer and fatter to accommodate larger trucks like atlas and bolzen, also they could taper to the deck, widening as they go a little, it helps stabilize thos big eskate hangers at 218mm. I am using two long haired boy 190kv motors here in this 1st mounting test, the wires are typical of most high end high power motors, but the wires are long on the motor itself, verses the vesc like with the Hobbyking kit. With the HK kit I would be forced to mount the vesc wires under the riser and bullet connectors would be between the truck and riser, not the best configuration but I will give it a try for a picture. I would like to see them slightly larger in all dimensions, also the slot for mounting hardware should be two holes instead to create a more stable base, again for these giant long hangers..

PS, they are a pain to install because you need like 6 hands to hold in the wires while mounting a heavy truck with motors mounted to it. I will work on a better method just because  it's dangerous to mess it up, you will smash your phase wires..

Look what Popped up! Nice and sturdy , took me a while to figure it out (I was like where’s the holes like a dumbass.make sure your wires aren’t short or there’s no point of the riser. It looks flexible like rubber but feels sturdy. Maybe it’s the transparency that throws me off. 

 Bad pictures sicne I don’t have screws to hold I.T down but:

Got the riser from @Alphamail and it looks well made and solid.

The translucent color is a little deceptive as it makes it look as if it should be squishy, but its very much solid.

My hub motors were supposed to be here yesterday, but DHL ding dong ditched me so now I have to wait until Monday for them and to finish up the build over the weekend.

anxious to get everything together at this point.

Ill also be needing to pick up longer bolts since the ones on hand are too short.

Finally getting around to install these on my Spud. Gonna try to carve them into submission. (Not gonna happen :wink:). 

They are harder than they look, like a petrified gummy bear, and they feel very solid. And the translucent color is really cool. I think @b264 suggested the idea of LED's in the riser, but I ain't got time for that, so a shredlight mounted in front of it will have to do for now.

Before mounting them on my single Carvon v2.5 Spud, I thought I'd check the fit of dual sensored motor wires, and although it's tight, they do seem to fit, 12awg sensor wires and all.

some pictures of it inatalled.  it does seem to be a bit in the way of the shred light and their mounts, so the cable needs some slack to be out of the way, but aside from that fit is great.

@squishy654 
@Jc06505n
@Mobutusan
@Aleks

Please summarize your thoughts on the design, in particular: 

Go with the design as is or does it need modification?  I can open up the spacing for the wires in height and width but to do so the exterior will grow slightly but the overall height can stay the same.  The exterior dimensions are at the low end of the spectrum so there is room to grow.   I would prefer to do this right the first time we go into production.
```

```
Overall, I like the design, but if possible, I would like the riser to be a bit lower profile since I like to only use as much riser as necessary. The riser could be a bit wider and longer if that would help making it lower profile, and also cover the full area of the baseplate. I'd rather the riser be slightly oversize to accommodate various baseplates than too small. And if that allows for a slightly wider area for the wires to exit, even better. 

I'd also like to see some old school type board rails in those yummy gummy colors that could accommodate some strip LED's, and serve as grab rails for picking up and carrying the board. Something like this, but maybe tailored to Esk8 a bit more with a slightly more ergonomic shape for fingers to grasp.

Will 10awg and a sensor wire fit? Not for typical builds but maybe those bigger amp builds. Is not an edge case anymore to pull 100A+ with large motors and a big pack, if possible support 10awg to be all inclusive. A few mm, not sure of impact on feel and stability

So I am with Mobu, I really like my risers to be at least as big as my trucks base plate or a touch larger.

& looking at the feed back from reviews thus far it appears that three 10AWG motor wire will fit or three 12AWG motor wires and the sensor wires so people are running out of space with sensor-ed 10AWG motors.

i would say take some meat off the corners marked in green, to ease angle cables enter and have more wiggle room, and maybe round more of the corners.

It’s a good design a bit more spacing to accommodate 10awg with sensors as 12 awg wires make it difficult to fit the sensors wires. I’ll be able to give more details tomorrow once I’m at the office. 

Any plans for making a taller riser (insane I know) for Carvon folks? Motors with Electroc Bike Connectors are a no go with these.

Just for fun, here are a few more shots of the riser with a white shredlight mounted in front of the riser, facing rearward. Makes a cool taillight. Gonna try to find time to test out LED strip lighting too.
@alphamail, I'd really like to see some translucent board rails for grabbing and picking up the board. Even cooler would be either an embedded led strip or maybe a waterproof 2 piece sandwich design that will accommodate LED strip lighting of your choice.

I say increased the overall dimensions and the wire grooves, maybe even taper the pad to the deck to help display its proper orientation as well. I also vote for 8 individual hardware holes instead of the slots

## \#166 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2018-06-30T16:41:51.255Z Reads: 152

```
The slots are there to accommodate deck and truck tolerance as well as offering use when used in combination with a angled riser so you don't need to bend the bolts to fit the tightened mount position as the angle increases .  I will draw up a modified version.  I don't think it is a good idea to force the orientation towards the deck since sharp truck base plates can easily be rounded if it makes sense to run the slot towards the base plate in certain situations

Damn, I have to decide what colors I want.  I really want to get some colored ones, but want a matching front.  I know this has been mentioned before, but...

I know, I know, I could use 2 tunnel risers, but that seems kind of pointless just to match colors.

@Alphamail was this project successful enough to do a run of front risers with no tunnels so we can color match a bit easier?  If so I want to get some of those luscious colors, if not I will grab some black... 

Shit, analog skaters who need some 1/2" risers would buy them up as well.  They look so much more intriguing than your run of the mill black offerings that most companies offer.

Just a thought.

I realize this may be counterintuitive but the solid riser will cost more to be 3d printed in high resolution since they charge by volume of resin used as well as time.  The part made out of premium urethane will cost more also because it will use 30 to 35% more material per pour so it will be more expensive than the Tunnel version

Please let us know what you find regarding bolt length, we chose what we use here but not everyone uses the same thickness board as us.  If it is a common problem, we will up the supplied length to 2" or 50mm.  Too long or too short are both irritating to me personally so please let us know.  We supplied fasteners to you guys, not sure if we will do it once they hit our website.

brad, no need to change anything on your end.

the deck i'm using here, it's just a bit thicker because there's a recess down the middle for components.  in addition to that, i'm adding another 2mm or so because of [this thing](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-are-those-x-things-called/32370/10)

had it been a normal deck the bolt you sent would have been perfect.

also, order fulfillment was nothing but a joy dealing with Tracey.

lastly, i love the risers and is going to yield just a much more tidy back-end to our builds.  goob job!

Yes, bolt selection is probably best left to an individual decision with esk8 parts, unlike with sk8 parts.  Most of the bolts probably will need to be replaced anyway because they are too long or too short or the wrong head or not class 9 or whatever...

Finally got everything buttoned up. Man that was a pain. Had to solder longer motor wires so that the bullets didn't end up underneath the riser because there is very little room under there. Also had to route the sensor wires outside. But all in all I'm happy with the result!

Big thank you mucho RipTide folks, wishing you great eSk8-Success in your eskate product line.

READ the first post for details.

Basically, go to their site. Purchase gift certificate in increments of $15 PER riser with a note saying it's for Tunnel Risers

Within an hour, you should get an email from Riptide with the certificate. You can respond to that email with your name, address and riser color and they should get back to you.

Some clearance issues have come up DIY's running really fat pipes and I took a look at the design to ask here if changing the tunnel height to 12 mm from 8 mm would cover the trend towards large diameter wires?![Tunnel%20Riser%20rev%20F%20sae|690x487](upload://bYGQrjeOLDb2bhpjBE8l7NvEbCi.JPG)![Tunnel%20Riser%20rev%20F%20metric|690x487](upload://6d4LHr17MjWV5yIQjXwXl7dyCEY.JPG)

@Cobber Overall height remains the same, just more head height for the wires.  This could actually be a second product for extra clearance

If it's selling well, I would make a second version for that unless it's far cheaper to modify the existing mold

It is acting as a connecting web at this thickness to keep the 4 pillars aligned.  I would not want to go much thinner.

Makes sense. Already seemed thin enough to me. I don't have a problem getting all the phase and sensor wires in, so if you could go thin on the bottom and reduce the overall height while keeping the same size wire routing area, you could have a low pro riser option as well. I'd go for that.

Do you have photos when you routed all the wires in? was there some allowance for movement on the wires in your experience?

I have seen several threads where the wires are very tight in the current configuration.  Perhaps they are extreme cases but something to consider.

It's pretty snug with all wires side by side, but there's also room available to route the sensor wires over the phase wires instead. Realistically, they won't stay side by side when in use, and will all "float" around in the channel, which is fine, but there is more than enough room for all the wires.

Right. maybe I'm not trying to get them flat across the channel properly which is why I ended up laying the sensor wires over the phase wires. But like you mentioned, They will be moving about during actual usage so it wouldn't matter much anyway as long as they can move freely around. 

Don't think there's a need for a riser with more space unless using thicker wires? I recall my phase wires are at 12awg

The deeper channel option might come in handy for 10 gauge wires, but for reference, this is how much of the total channel area that 12awg+sensor wires take up when all moved to one side (only about 60-70% of the opening).
![20180911_213106|690x388](upload://x73JPqj4YFoIveIIcTHipmpcB7q.jpg)

And if you also made a lower profile version, like 9-10mm thick with a 7-8mm deep channel (it's 8mm deep now from my measurements), you could stack 2 to accommodate really fat wires and even mix & match colors.

Wow that would be good to have on giant motors. Not sure which ones actually have wires that thick :laughing:

Are you still able to tug the wires when they are compressed like that? Is it possible for them to get that way in regular use?

The stack option is interesting but it gets a bit expensive for the end user to throw that much cash at specialized risers.

That's true, but on the other hand, a lower profile riser could appeal to the "little to no riser" set of builders, would use less material, and if you were to sell them at like $15-16 each, and only needed one, it could actually save some money. And then if you sold a 2 pack for like $30, then you get the full front and rear set for a good price, and the flexibility of stacking them if necessary. Then the next inevitable question of whether to use ugly no-name risers on the front, or just buy another pair from Riptide. Hmmmm....:thinking: 

We Esk8ers love options, even if we don't use them, and these risers are one of the least expensive parts in this hobby anyway.

Yore write. This isn't just a hobby or transportation for a lot of folks, it's a religion (cult?), and an addiction, and a money pit, and mental therapy, and the purest electrically motorized manifestation of a restless DIY soul. :nerd_face:

But if it's _just_ transportation to you, well....:thinking:
