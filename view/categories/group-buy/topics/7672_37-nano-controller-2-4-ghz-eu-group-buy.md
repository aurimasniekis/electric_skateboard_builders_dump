Thanks for reading if you have any questions please just ask.

Also if you are a fan of the trigger style controller that would cost $30

Yeah no taxes since the EU is a single so there are free movement of goods, capital, services and persons.

"The main exclusions to this are goods subject to export licensing controls, eg military goods or Class A drugs, and goods classed as excise products, eg alcohol, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils."

Should be around 10 Euros for shipping

Hi guys just talked to the guys over in china and i have managed to get the price to drop from $50 to $37 if we manage to get 30 controllers ordered. If any of these price changes are appealling to you and you want another controller please let me know. Please tell all your friends etc. Trying to hit 30 controller :slight_smile:

Thanks for reading guys :D

Here's the most updated list

Hey there! I might be interested in buying 1 nano as well, but I do have some questions: Are these prices (so 50-37$) tax, import duty and shipping included (from Belgium so inside the EU)? And how long would these take to get here (depending on when you order and how long the shipping takes)? Have to say it does look like a sweet deal :smirk:

## \#54 Posted by: bigben Posted at: 2016-08-16T17:39:24.470Z Reads: 131

So about €33 or £29?
These are arriving into the uk so will they go direct to each buyer or will you then work out extra individual shipping to all buyers?
These are the "winning" controllers?

85a is probably too hard. 75 to 82a is common. More people tend to go to softer wheels atm.

But like 3$ for 4 wheels or what??😃

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/has-anyone-not-had-issues-with-the-winning-remote/8524/31

if it is, suggest everyone reads and understands binding / etc before taking out too far or too fast!

Got mine aswell!  
4gbp was send to you. 

The remote isn't working here though,  could somoene that got it to work,  explain how he did?  

I did the binding proces as follows. 
Esc in Channel 1, 
Bind plug in ch3
Turn on esc
Hold bind button and turn on remote 
Led goes to a constant red =binded
Pull out the bind plug,  red led goes out, 
Try to give it some throttle,  nothing happens.  
Did this 3 times.  Also restarted esc couple of times.

Although the soldering could be better. It needs some touching up. Look at the binding button. It's functioning fine, but that could be a problem for some remotes if the binding doesn't work.

Oh sorry, I thought you were talking about the mini. I'd get rid of the nano if I were you. They are very unreliable and can cause injuries.

I'm honestly not sure, I've never used those remotes because they sound sketchy. @Kaly @RunPlayBack might be able to help as they use these remotes

You need to be user level 3 or above to run group buys, so you can just stick around a little longer so the community can trust you, then open your first group buy.

Probably best to stick around until you can post topics should be about 30 min of reading then you can make a topic about your products to avoid being spammy and give people a place to post their feedback and reviews, have seen a few other similar posts to get early tester feedback.
