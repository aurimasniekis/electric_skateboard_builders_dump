**GROUP BUY ENDS THIS SATURDAY 11:59 PM PT**

I don't think the Ownboard ESC and remote needs any introduction, but for those not in the know, it has a super smooth throttle and brake that's nearing VESC levels of smooth. The ESC is reflashed with a higher ERPM, so it's capable of hitting 24mph on meepo-styled hubs.

I'm ordering a ton of them in a couple weeks, so I figured this is a pretty good opportunity to set up a group buy.

Modified ESC + Meepo-style hubs with ebike connectors + Ownboard Thumbwheel remote = $200 including shipping

If you could somehow prove 24mph I would cry because I'm Running uncensored single motor and your telling me You can get same theoretical top speed but with 2 motors for nice braking,
For a lot less. I needed to buy a Pulley kit, Motor mount, Trucks that work with it, a remote, a focbox etc :joy:

Yep this is going to be equipped in the Banshee. Notice the custom motor end cap sporting my modified logo. Since I'm going to be ordering a batch of them, I may as well open a quick group buy and see if any builders here are interested for their budget builds.

No there won't be a front truck for all of this. It's solely the rear truck, ESC, remote, and motors.

Edit: And yes, the rear trucks should be 180mm

Can you replace the urethane and would you consider to do aluminium part of hub black? Would look much better. 
Do you have some pics of inside? I'm asking because I wonder can you modify those to fit Ronin trucks for example. @PredatorBoards

The urethane is not replaceable, unfortunately.
I doubt you'll be able to modify them to fit on Ronins. You're probably better off machining your own trucks, if that's the case.

Haven't done a test on top speed, but they feel pretty fast AND **smooth**. We are talking easily as smooth as a VESC from my experience now.

Nope, the urethane is not replaceable. That's why the ebike connectors exist. For the sole purpose of being able to swap out the entire motor assembly as easily as possible.

I wouldn't be able to acquire trucks for that low (let alone sell them for that low), simply because I'm not buying at a large enough quantity to lower the costsz

And sorry to be prude, but man up. $25 for a front truck is not going to kill you. In fact it will do the exact opposite, since it's much less likely to snap on you while riding at high speeds.

Ahh, I'm sorry, I assumed you were buying from Ownboard but ofcourse you could also be buying from the actual manufacturer directly.

Also, what about the wheels? It is pretty hard to find 90mm (matching) black front wheels here in the EU :grimacing:

I asked the manufacturer, and their response was that it would cost more separately. Lowest I can go is $100 for just the ESC alone... any less and it's simply not worth the hassle of dealing with customs.

So we completed a 33 mile group ride today in SF. Was using this:

![IMG_4269|375x500](upload://nYJ3OuCGAjkN1sjWEX5LFvrRdkf.JPG)

Banshee drivetrain + 10S2P 30Q battery

Was able to speed up all the hills here, though admittedly I'm extremely light. Easily did stretches of 16 miles of straight riding with this setup. Our charge stops added up to a grand total of 1.5 hrs on a 2A charger.

We're upping the amperage of this ESC to ensure this bad boy plays nice with heavier weight riders.

Yep, so a little update on what's going on.

Basically we had issues with the shipping costs not matching with the actual quantity of products you order. This problem is compounded with the domestic versus international customers.

So now, we've split the listing into two listings. One for US domestic buyers, and one for international buyers. International buyers will have the drivetrain shipped directly to them from the factory in china. US domestic customers will have their drivetrain shipped over to me, and then me to them.

The pricing for these new listings include costs of shipping. You're not actually paying more, instead the price you see on the listing is precisely what you pay.

Anyone in the SoCal area (I'm in San Diego) want to go half on a pair of wheels/trucks, It would be about $30 for a front truck with 2 90mm wheels & bearings -- of the clone variety.  I really don't want to ship since that would easily add $10-15, so in person would be better.

Do these ESC's need a heatsink plate?

I know the ownboards use a metal enclosure which acts as one, so not sure if its recommended.

Also do you know if the on/off switch is a momentary switch? or is it latching and stays depressed while on?

They always use such tiny switches, I like to upgrade to a big one, so would like to know since they take forever to come from china.

## \#83 Posted by: PredatorBoards Posted at: 2018-04-07T22:18:13.986Z Reads: 230

```
The ESC is still encased in the metal casing. I think it's fine for the most part, as it barely gets warm to the touch after prolonged use. The power switch is momentary, meaning the ESC is capable of automatically shutting off if left unattended for a prolonged amount of time.

I'm loving the new ESC in the Banshee, as it literally transformed the ride. Your stance on the board is much more relaxed than before, allowing you to fluidly shift your weight and carve without feeling like you're going to throw yourself off if you blip the throttle too much. I've tried pretty much all the other prolific shortboards, and the throttle is simply unparalleled.

I'm trying to nail down specs for the battery pack I'm gonna use for this.

@PredatorBoards you're using 10s2p samsung 30q in the Banshee, right? So about 40a batttery max? I know you specified 12A motor amps per motor, but at least on vesc, motor amps can (and should) be higher than battery amps.

Do you know if the ESC can handle 12s? I'm thinking this will be a great swapout for my jet spud, which currently has 4 x 3s lipo (it's a pain to hit 10s with lipos).

Right now I'm considering:
- reuse 4 x 3s1p lipos (12s 5ah)
- build 10s2p 30q pack (40a discharge)
- build 12s1p a123 pack (~40a discharge, I have the cells on hand)
- 2 x 5s1p lipo (probably HK Graphene 4ah, on sale for $50/pc. thick! 65c discharge)
- 5 x 2s lipo (expensive and bulky for spud)
```

I highly doubt it can handle 12S, though admittedly I haven't hooked up a 12S battery pack to test it. I'd second a 30Q battery pack, since you won't really experience voltage sag until you use up a majority of the capacity.

Can I use the original banshees hub motors with this new esc and remote? Would it cause any differences? 
And does this remote have different gear settings? (Slow, fast modes) or is it just a smoother acceleration? (No more massive kickback acceleration throwing you off the board) 


Thanks

Yes you can use the Banshee motors. However you will have to manually solder the wires, since the ESC does not have easily accessible JST ports. Alternatively you can rewire your hub motors to terminate into an ebike connector. It's plug and play from there.

Yes it's the same as Ownboards offerings but @PredatorBoards had the firmware tweaked, so you get a little bit more torque and speed with his kit. The meepo esc is awful, don't recommend it. Also the side plates have a different design on this kit, I think it looks way better.

For any of those concerned with how to install their ESCs through the holes of their enclosures, the ebike connectors are detatchable on both ends. They can route through any hole and make use of a PG7 cable gland to ensure a water tight seal.

I cant even feel the difference between the front and back wheel size difference its such a minor difference. I dont think youll need to change the front wheels to larger ones.
Plus if u really want the same size wheels, you can just keep the old motor on, just take care when disconnecting the old esc, cause you can simply reconnect the new esc onto the old motor, keeping the original hub motor wheels, 
Works exactly the same as the new hub motor, just the wheel size difference is 90mm to the original 83mm.

What’s up guys. Sorry for going dark a little bit, lots of stuff has been happening recently on my side (both personal and business related). As of now UPS apparently messed up the manifest (there are 5 individual boxes shipped together). They’re telling me they do indeed have the packages and are just sorting things out. Sorry about the delay, but this was unfortunately out of my control.

Guessing everyone wants their units still?  Just thinking about building a new board after I just got rid of my last one...  I might just buy a meepo for the season and build next winter...

So this kit basically just needs a 10s3p battery (from whoever, maybe diye) then the front trucks and board and you are set?  Man that's a steal.

you should be able to use any 10s battery, even 1p, of course with varying results in performance.

I built a 10s3p Samsung 30Q pack and am just waiting for this kit to arrive, everything else on the board is done and just waiting.

Guys calm down, he told y’all just last week that there was a mix up with ups, he still then needs to get the packages a re-ship them out to individuals.

He was (or currently still is) in Japan and will be back to the states soon. Once he gets back he'll most likely begin shipping everything out. Everyone needs to chill, if you cant take a few delays & moments of little communication during a group buy, don't join a group buy.

My bad everybody. Packages finally arrived at the post office so all that’s left is to physically pick them up and send them out. Shipments via USPS Priority mail begin this Friday. For those who want to pull out, I don’t blame you. Although this was not my intention, I do regret having taken so long to get a handle on the situation and not finding a faster method for shipping out these kits.

Hey, can you answer a question for me? I have supposedly the same motor as these which I bought from DIYeboard last year and one of them started to develop some lateral play. When I push the motor back and forth, it moves about 1mm or so. And when I ride that motor rattles. Have you fixed this problem on these motors?

So i took the new motors and esc for a quick test around the neighborhood...![image|281x499](upload://l7XYe3UnH36WJawKruteIXSB0O2.png) and overall I am a very satisfied customer! The acceleration and braking is SUPER smooth but i kinda wish the brakes were a bit more abrupt. I also felt lik i could still slide forward down a hill while holding the brakes ( although going at a snails pace). There is no place on the Esc for a voltage meter but the remote displays the boards battery life using lights. I also prefer a thumb trigger vs a thumb wheel remote but thats just preference. The remote has a really great feel and has battery indicator as well as speed modes and a seitch for forward and reverse. I will be switching the bushings. That’s pretty much the all negative.
It goes fast without any stutters. The thane over the motors does a little better than my last pair. This is after my ride ![image|375x500](upload://bwSvTVNGTnasizNXnoXuNfKGRBx.jpeg) i had a 10s5p battery with the enclosure coming from diyeboard but could not fit it in my drop deck so i went top mounted enclosure ![image|375x500](upload://skV7F92FecCIERzSjTClbLsIKMV.jpeg)

I really enjoy this set for my commuter board. Hope everyone gets there kits soon... 
P.S. I love the Ebike connector thingys!!!

Usps priority takes 1-3 days. These were shipped a week ago. I am guessing priority was required as I do not believe the kits fit first class specifications.  Has anyone received there unit in the mail? No pick up?? It seems odd no one has received them still. Everyone in the US should have gotten their units.

@PredatorBoards bravo. Did the maiden test ride last night, performed exactly as I expected which is no small task. It's no dual 6355, but there's plenty of poke, enough to feel satisfied in all reasonable situations, and good enough brakes. Can climb big hills from standing with my fatass on it, and so smoooooooth smoooooooth.

I have to redo some stuff to get everything to fit the enclosure, but it'll be a nice addition to the stable.

Thanks man, worth the wait and the great GB price.

Hi.
I have bought a skateboard from you and the controller doesn‘t work anymore.
I tried a lot to contact you but i got no response.
Are you going to answer or what?

Try tagging who you're talking to like this 

@PredatorBoards 

They were last active on this site November of 2018 sooooo good luck. What's the problem with the remote?

Oh ok thank you.
I can‘t charge it. There is a problem with the kit coz i tried everything.
I actually bought another remote from wowgo website. It‘s exactly the same but they won‘t match. No one in the website answers.
I really don‘t know what to do

Usually with the non-programmable electronic speed controllers (esc), the remote is pre-bound to the receiver. I'll look into it on mine and see how it looks when I get home

If you have a new remote then you need to look for a pairings guide, there should be a button on the ESC (little red or black dot) that you press and hold the power button on the remote to connect
