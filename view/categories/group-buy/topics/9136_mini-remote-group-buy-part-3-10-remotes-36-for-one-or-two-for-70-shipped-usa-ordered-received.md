It's a great remote that's small and just works.

Uses just two AA batteries that last a very long time. (Not included)

Please post your request here...once we hit 10...I'll hit you up for money. It takes abt one week for me to get them from the day the order is made...sometimes sooner. As long as I have your address by the time it arrives ... I should be able to mail it out to you first class, the next day with a tracking number if you want it.

Thanks üëäüèª

Maybe you could add that the shipping is included for USA (only?). I assume you wont include shipping to europe in the given price ;)

Thanks, @Michaelinvegas, this is really a great remote, with smooth action, a reliable connection and a very nice form factor for my smallish hands!

One question for the group: how do you know when the transmitter batteries are getting low? Does the red led somehow indicate that? Also, and I guess this is a second question for the group, has anyone come up with a good way to prevent the throttle trim adjuster from inadvertently shifting? I'd hate for it to shift such that neutral throttle becomes positive throttle!

All I can say is the battery last a long time...

I've had my batteries in for a month and haven't changed it...I ride daily

Maybe this has been addressed before. I wanted to ask has anyone noticed that the remote limits your top speed. I went from 35 on nano to 29 on mini. Trim set to max. Pull trigger and turn trim up and it will give the true top speed. That's a significant issue. Making sure this is a across the board issue with these remotes before I send back to where I purchased it.

I use this remote with a VESC. After setting up the limits in the BLDC tool to allow 100% throttle, I get exactly the same top speed as with a GT2B.

Any chance you know which battery terminal is +? I think it says on the PCB "Batt +" nearest the one that is positive but it's really sketchy.
