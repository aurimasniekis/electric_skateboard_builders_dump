After we decide, I will collect all of your info (address, email, how many you want) and then liion will send out individual invoices with shipping ($8 - $15). So you pay liion directly. Everything should ship 'immediately' because they are all in stock. 

On a side not I am going to organize a group buy for 6354 /
 6374 190kv censored motors. All black stealth looking beauties. Should 
have details tomorrow, with steep discounts. Here is a sneak peak.

Those motors come at a good time for me. Looking for 4wd motors, so must for dual on trucks. Safe to assume that works for the 6354 not 6374?

Is there a big advantage to the HG2? It's in between the price and capacity of the HE2 and Basen, and only $1 less than the Basen... Wouldn't it be better in the long run, to spend $30 or so and get Basen Cells? They just seem quite a bit more expensive than the HE2 and Samsung 18650, and not that much less in cost than the Basen...

10A is kinda low. You will need to stack a lot in parallel to achieve the right amount of amps. Where are u putting 80 cells on a deck?

@JLabs
If you get within 10 of the necessary 200 i'll increase my order from 30 to 40 to account for the last 10.  Im debating whether I want to go 10s3p or 10s4p on this pack.  Currently running a 12s4p but want to save some weight on my newest build.  Maybe I don't want to save THAT much weight.  LOL

Put me down for 40 actually. I think that brings us up to 83.  We only need 17 more then to get to the next discount! Someone else get in on this!

Hi JLabs thanks for all your hard work organizing this!

Fortunately/Unfortunately I just found something that might screw this up for the Basen guys.

I was browsing on Alibaba and see that there really is only one supplier of Basen cells, Shenzhen Basen Technology Co., Ltd.  Presumably it wouldn't be too hard to get legitimate cells from the source as there isn't like a wack of sellers to wade through like there is for some of the other brands.  I messaged them and it they can sell at $4.78 per cell or less.  Of course there will be shipping costs on top of that. But there are shipping costs for Liion as well.  Wondering if we should put the Basen group buy on hold?

I'm not in a rush for the cells, so I was thinking of ordering a sample from them.  I will check them out and if they are good, we can do a Basen group buy direct from the seller.  Savings could be quite significant.
```

---
## \#121 Posted by: JLabs Posted at: 2016-09-07T10:21:16.941Z Reads: 123

That could work well. But then there is $100+ shipping to you, and then more from you to them. And you have to get a sample before hand. And then you have to place the order and wait for it to arrive. If u guys wanna go ahead, just let me know.

This is what I'm going to do. I wanted 40 cells.  I'm going to order a sample of 20 from them and 20 from the group buy here.

I will report back to everyone on the sample and if everything works and economics make sense, we can do another group buy at some point in the future directly from the manufacturer.  Maybe by then we will have proven these cells a little more and more people might be interested.  Then we can get some major savings!

We have 42 basens (22 for me and 20 for @johnny_261) , so we should be at $7.26 already no? we would need 8 more to get $7.10. atleast thats my understanding.

3 - 24 = $7.82

50 - 99 = $7.10

I looked at their site. They ship to Canada.
They also ship to other Countries as long as enough batteries were ordered @lox897 I want 84 pretty soon, we only need to get 200+ and they'll ship to Australia, iirc you're in Melbourne?

The price is $4.33 right now. If you order enough to get over the 500 mark an extra 300 you will get the 500 price. If u plan on ordering less than that I will talk to John and I am sure he will give you the 500 price.

They're rated to 15amps but in tests against the lg hg2, which is the highest rated amp draw at 20amps, the 30q do just as well if not better.   Most often they're cheaper.  And one is  poo brown while the other labia pink

liion will ship to Australia, only if you have an order of 200+ batteries going to the one address. However like @lox897 said we ordered from nkon and they got them to us pretty fast. The prices they advertise on ru.nkon.nl apply to anyone outside EU. Anyone EU has to use eu.nkon.nl (for taxes). 
They have their discount at 30+ batteries I think. Which means you pay the same per cell whether you buy 30 cells or 600 cells. I think the shipping is a pretty flat rate too. I'd say it's likely 30EURO/box. Between @lox897 and I we ordered 130 and they were split into 2 boxes.
They places every 2 cells into a plastic holder and then cling/plastic wrap them in groups of 10 cells. The box is filled with foam peanuts and has spacers(carboard) to absorb shocks. I can't tell you want voltage they came yet as I'm in the middle of a move and can't find my multi-meter, I may just buy another tonight though.

If you're looking for the Panasonic ncr18650pf cells then I'm looking for some other people to split an order from battery bro with because of the high shipping price. Check out the post I did on it. If it were just two people it should cost $216 per 50cells plus shipping to you from me. If we got a couple more people in it would go down to 200$. @Redpredator8
