Maybe the thread got pushed downward so people may have missed it? Or you’re moving faster than people can get their monies ready lol

I don’t know.  The dimensions are on their site. I imagine it will no prob. The 6.6s almost fit beside each other n the hole is 145mm diameter

I had two packages lost recently using usps priority. Never happened before and now twice.  Usps priority is insured for only 50$ standard I think and have to confirm that but writing to offer more insurance. I’ll find the details on cost and if u want to do it we can figure it before I ship. They should be shipped to me today.

I might have to grab one of these after all if you do another order @Hummie 
Good to have a backup for the R1, especially since it won't be going over 10s

If 4$ each can cover it now, I would not mind sending it to you. Maybe the others would agree as well.

I really want to see some testing done one these before I buy them but I can't seem to find a general consensus on this forum. I'm so tornn buy these for $120? or shed out a few extra $ for some FOCBOXs augghh

If you don't want to take a chance and know someone who can get you a FOCBOX now then i think it would be better to go with FOCBOX.

I think these are solid though and so far no complaints on the 6.6. There's a few guys already testing them and they don't look to be encountering any problems

I agree the price to performance ratio for these are just unbeatable I'll just have to decide before the next group buy I just wanna know if these can run FOC

Yeah 10s seems to run fine no problem. Flipsky has their rep on the line as these are tested but its looking good. No catastrophic failures from what I’ve seen :laughing:

That's actually very impressive. I've actively tried to figure out at what point failure occurs and I can't. It's cutsofd when the amperage is too high but it doesn't actually fail.  Pretty good circuit protection.

Thanks Mike! glad to have you trying to get them to blow up. at what amps does it cut off at? just lowering it and its all good to go again?

So 10S is fine even in FOC? At what amperage do they cut ogf?

Essentially. I typically start at 50a, that's too high for the FSESC Dual. I dropped it to 30 and ut hasn't cuout yet. I'm going to raise the battery amps to 50 tomorrow and see what that does.

I think i'd be freaked by the cutoffs especially as they would happen at the highest throttle.  im glad to hear the 6.6 is sounding solid though so far.  i'll do another group buy as soon as I get the last goup buy stuff out tomorrow.  sorry on the delay this time with the flipsky group buys and stuff came Thursday or Friday just thing after thing kept stopping them getting to the post office.  have even been there 2 times since they came.  labels done and out the door to you for sure tomorrow
