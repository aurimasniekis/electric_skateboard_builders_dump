How bright are they? I can't seem to find a good picture of them at night where you can see their true brightness. Also, is there a group buy price for the kit? As the kit is cheaper than buying them individually.

@Michaelinvegas Do you think we could group buy a bunch of extra brackets for these lights too? I think it's great that these things are easily removable and it would be awesome to have all my boards fitted with the brackets. Just slap the lights on whatever build you're riding that night, and go!

For what it's worth, I've got the new shred lights on 5 of my eboards and long boards. My skateboards that don't have lights have the brackets installed so I can swap the lights to any board I'm riding that night. Eric is the owner and the company is based out of San Diego. Small operation and a really cool product I was happy to support. 

You guys are gonna love your new shreds :grin:

Edit: Forgot to mention, I picked up one set of the red tail lights and decided I didn't like them as much as the head lamps.  Each of the tail lights I received are slightly different hues of red, and are not as bright as I hoped they would be. I think they might still be ironing out their new tail light design. I'll be swapping my red lights out for another set of the normal headlamps.  Hope this helps you guys decide what to buy. I see a lot of people interested in the tail lights here as well.

It would probably be even easier if you send all EU orders to just one person that then distributes it. Shipping inside EU is basically the same as inside the single countries (maybe 4€ more) and would thus also be even cheaper.
Maybe someone from the EU country with the most orders?

I would say yes, especially since they're $1.99/pair normally, so I'm guessing they might be around $1/pair for this group buy? I also noticed they have small and regular size bracket options to fit old school or new school truck bolt holes.

I do want also a Front and a rear Set. So i am going to help out the EU members:
Shipping to EU will be quite expensive. The only realistic Option is to send it to one person in the EU who will redirect them. Last time i bought from @Michaelinvegas i have paid 22,50

I think we can put at least 10 orders in such a parcel! So total Shipping (to me and then to each individual) will be around 5€.  I will inform everyone of the final price in the end when we know how much people will order The lights. 

Conclusion: if you are from the EU and interessted just write it down here. I will arrange everything with Michael

Ok Ladies and Germs


Here's the deal.....

By Thursday a google doc will be created by Shreadlights....

You will put your order and all your mailing information in the doc and send your payment to me

Once all orders and Paynents are recieved ....Ill pay shreadlights 

shredlights has so graciously said they will send all of your orders direct....the only exception is Europe ... they will be sending your orders to their guy in the U.K. first...then to you 

......

PLEASE NOTE: Shredlights has asked me to limit the order to 50 Sets of two, so basically a 100 sets of lights (I hope that makes sense) The reason is the special pricing we were given and could upset thier Vendors....But this is one off deal to introduce their lights to the Esk8 community so this is will not be an on going deal.

I think it is actually the same whether you send from UK to mainland Europe or from any other European country.
Royal mail tracked is like 8.75pounds if I remember correctly. That would be 10€.
DHL takes 8.89€ to send tracked from Germany to other European countries.

These are pretty clever. I'd put a set on a normal skateboard

But you've already got a giant battery strapped to your board...  Why use lights that you have to charge separately?  You can get lights that are much brighter for less money.  All you need is a 12V BEC.  My headlights are even remote controlled by my GT2B on CH3

What lights are you using, and how are they mounted?  I'm getting these because of the mounts. I bought [these] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HM4AP6U/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_CyuFyb9M4FVFJ)  but mounting with heavy duty velcro they pop off.

Ok ........

Here we go.....

Here's the deal....

At this moment we are gonna focus on the North American and Australian orders!

What Eric has agreed to do...to save me from the pain of mailing each one myself..... Shredlights will mail them....So, what he will do is send you an invoice for your order w/ shipping....and you pay him 🤑👍🏻 .... (yippy for me!!!!!!)

So at this moment @saul the form only shows what number of items were ordered, not who ordered what...we need to either modify he form or make a new one.

At Shredlights request, and the reason is because of inventory..Eric asks to limit your order to one set front and back (or two sets of lights-same color)..again this is because of inventory. So, if you are buying it for your buddy....have him order his own set. 😉 I have asked him to allow multiple orders for Australia 🇦🇺 

... So, @saul can we fix the form?

As for the UK and EU ...

Hold on...he's need to speak with his distributor...he does have a new legal agreement with him and does not want to upset his new partnership ... which is understandable so he's got some negotiating to do...



.

Oh and let me add this ....:


Shredlights is put together by hand...by Eric and his team. Very in the spirit of DIY.

He wanted a way to reach out to the Esk8 community and get them talking abt Shredlights....and this is his way...

I hope you guys help spread the word and help them out...pictures on your social media helps and of course word of mouth.

And maybe down the line we can help him design one down the road? 

Anyway...thanks everyone for being involved in the group buy.

Lol dude we shall all see ... i did speak to him abt all of this ... he'll have to take a look and see what everyone ordered.... and that's a manual process ... so I'm gonna assume he's gonna call me when he sorts out the orders ...and so far I haven't heard back.... his target was to send out invoices by the end of the week but again it's a lot more orders than he was expecting....(he under estimated the response) 

So...either I'll hear something and I tell you guys....

Or you get an invoice for your orders....

I know this isn't a super cut and dry process...sorry abt that....totally shooting from the hip and thought of this in the middle of the night with zero planning...lol .... yeah my wife loves me a lot hahahah...

No clue mate .... it's a sticky situation from what I can tell with his man across the pond....

He's also owns a shop and supplies to other retailers in his territory....I told him that I'd ask you guys to check his stuff out and maybe check him before you check elsewhere...he sells decks and other items and could possibly support the esk8 community by offering other products that we are looking for....but it's a waiting game for now .... sorry folks ....

so if its too much for him and there are people that want more than the limit he asked for why not ask people who want more if they can compromise for the for a second set like i wanted 4 sets 2 of the white 2 of the red but i know i can only purchase 2 sets so for those of us who want more if we compromise for a second set I'd be willing to pay $30 for each second set and $20 for the first set it would still be a great price? idk thats just an idea

@Michaelinvegas Gotta give back somehow. All I seem do is take take take information, and buy buy buy shit around here. Lol.

Also, do you know if the front and rear lights are basically identical in construction and light output, aside from the lens color? I'm wondering if I could change the lenses on the rear lights to clear lenses and have another set of front lights? I'm thinking of rocking some of those crazy eBay lazer tail lights instead. I should have just bought two front sets from the beginning, since we were limited to 2 sets, but oh well. I'm still happy.

Got mine too! Big thanks to @michaelinvegas and Shredlights for making this happen. I'm a little bummed that I couldn't get a second full set of lights like I originally wanted, so I could add a set to my daughter's first longboard, but if these perform as good as they look, I might have to pick up another set anyway. 

I'm equally stoked on this caribiner skate tool. It's so much smaller and lighter than I expected.

Got my lights! They are so bright when they are both on together! I'm glad they don't have an annoying led blue tint to them too, they just look like headlights!

ya, I ordered some extra brackets, but got stickers instead; lol. 

I don't really mind missing the extra brackets though considering they were only a couple bucks and we were already get $40 off; infact, I'd rather have some sweet stickers to add to my laptop.

Been using my Shred Lights for a few days now and these things are awesome! Durable, bright, and compact. I've mounted other lights meant for bikes on my board and they end up rattling and not being secure enough. Broken a few too. Most are simply not made to take the vibration and abuse from a skateboard.

Has anyone hard wired their Shredlights to a USB stepdown voltage transformer so it recharges the lights batteries when the board is turned on?
