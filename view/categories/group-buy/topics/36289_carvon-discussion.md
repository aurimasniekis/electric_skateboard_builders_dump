I got my Carvon Hat on and hawking some direct drives!

So many people want an EVO but can‚Äôt shell out the 2k. It‚Äôs a lot of money no doubt. I‚Äôve seen so many people asking for just the drives on FB, IG and Reddit since Carvon dipped out of the DIY game..... Well this is your chance.

Jerry as agreed to make a limited run of the Carvon system. Which will just include the V4 Speed Drives that accept abecs or clone equivalent. To make myself clear, this set will only include the the Carvon Drive system. So, no wheels or front truck will be part of this special sale. It‚Äôs as ‚Äúa la cart‚Äù as I could get. Perfect for the the pro builder or first time DIYer. It‚Äôs your chance to get your Carve On your way.

Prices
$499 plus shipping 
$30 Continental USA
$50 Canada 
$70 UK & EU
$90 Australia

Includes Matte Black or Silver finish (your choice) Carvon v4 dual drive system on baseplate with adapters for Abec11 Wheels or Clone equivalent. *no wheels or front truck included

Tech Specs:

Features and Tech Specs:


Dual 110kv sensored motors, 2500W each
Custom-made precision CNC hanger and motor mounts
Motor mounts are screwed on for absolute no stator movement
Stepped-down axle (from 12mm, 10mm to 8mm) is removable and replaceable
Motors can be easily removed and inside bearings replaced
‚ÄãLow-carbon flux steel tubes for more power and protection
Axle end-to-end is 11 inches (280mm)

I need to hit at least 25 sets to make this happen and looking at January 2018 to get these in your hands.

Do you recommend a certain front truck that matches nicely with the drive?

Just saw that you guys also added the drive to your shop with 'Recommended Use' info. Thanks. Was about to ask you about that.

hey @Michaelinvegas, not sure how much business you do through paypal but a sudden inrush of funds have frozen even large paypal accounts.

i'm basing this on jehugarcia on youtube who did a group buy for liion cells.  almost all at once like $20k hit his account and paypal through it was some kind of fraud, despite jehu doing like $300k a month in transactions.

something to consider, maybe contact paypal in advance to get them prepared if you're not a paypal hotshot.

here's the video if interested:

*Please do not do pay as friends and family.

**Please ref Carvon V4 Group Buy, indicate the number of sets, Black or Silver also please add your Full name and address as well

$499 plus the cost of shipping. If you have multiple sets in the US add an additional $10 to the shipping. Any place else add $20 to the shipping.

If you are buying and have the funds now. Please make payment. 

For those that don‚Äôt have it yet, I am not sure how long Jerry will wait for payment. So, give me an idea and I will check with Jerry. If I cannot, he will obviously want people to fill in that spot. We aiming for January 2018 to send these out.

107mm+ sounds safer to me as it gets the speedrives further from the rocks and curbs, but a dual-drive with a heavy rider and a 107mm wheel has too low torque, I'm afraid

i'm asking jerry directly if it'd be ok, here's my message to him:

> i would like to get 5 sets, a couple to build on my own, and the remainder to resell later down the road.

> there is a very high demand for your drive system and already there are people who missed the group buy that wants them.

> but i do plan on marking them up just a bit, maybe 10%, to make it worth while for me.  so i wanted to make sure that you'd be ok with that.

if that's kind of chintzy, i'll just go with two.

Please explain, lol
My thought is all 4wd would be powered and connected to powered vescs, disconnect control signal from front 2wd, so you can't throttle or break, but you still can on rear 2wd, would the front 2wd then charge the battery and/or supplement current draw of rear 2wd

For Eu people, going to bed and then to work to check the Forum on lunch ment missing out. If there are poeple with 2+ orders to stock em up and resell later makes it even more bitter... 
2 questons then : 

- Is there anyway on earth we can increase the size of this grozo buy, was under 24 hours and over 30pcs.

- Wouod anyone willing to split a drive, who wants to resell them?  Broe over profit?  üòâ

Good morning peeps.....

Right now Jerry wants to square this deal away for the people that were able to jump on it.

I know some of you missed it. I‚Äôm sorry.  I definitely did my best to open it up to a larger group, but from 25 to 30 was really as much as I could push it. So, at the moment we are locked in with the people that chimes in first.  

Like I mentioned, this was a flash decision and I was super excited to let you guys know and not fully prepared to basically close this out after 3 hours. So Many Thanks üôèüèª to all of you!  

There are many people that have paid (as per Jerry) but there are still a few that have not yet. As mentioned, the people that have paid are waiting on the rest of you to complete your end of the deal to make this group buy successful. Again, I do understand that shit happens...So, if you need to bow out...it‚Äôs cool. Just let us know...but we need to fill your spot to make the group whole and to keep the timelines.

I know some of you have Pm‚Äôd me... not sure if I answered you all back...if I missed you.... hit me again lol

@Michaelinvegas

let me know what you think but i think we should keep a record of all the payments that have been sent.

we really should employ better financial governance since it's now a significant amount of money.

as far as i can tell, the following have sent in payments:

@b264
@ATLesk8
@Mikenopolis
@Fiori
@Yecrtz
@Jreamer
@DilatedPupils

**for those who have paid, can you please mention the email you used for the paypal transaction here or by PM. and if you can, the paypal transaction ID.  i will then add it to the spreadsheet.  once the records are set, we can then forward to jerry to make his life easier as well.**

also for full disclosure i'm giving away two of my sets to rpasichnyk and Ricky, they were the first two to respond to my last message about getting permission from jerry to buy 5 (to which he said yes, btw).  awaiting their confirmation.

also, i'm financing Blacksheep's two and charging 10% for the trouble.

It's kind of weird, there wasn't this kind of urgency when Jerry did the kickstarter including v3 motors, nor when he put the v4 motors up for sale on his site.

Now it's fire.

My theory, @bigboytoys and his crazy experiments.

And despite the hysteria in this thread, I still don't see how Carvon makes any money. Seems more a labor of love. Gonna call out @hummie and @evoheyax for this too. Crazy hub/directdrive maniacs.

Hey boys just wanna take a minute to give a a shout out to @thisguyhere for stepping up and help organize shit on this group buy.  

It‚Äôs a good thing when we rally around something...def see a lot of good out there. You guys are awesome.

Also stoked to see other people getting the opportunity to try out building your own Carvon .... gees it‚Äôs  like talking abt unicorns ü¶Ñ...but I guess we‚Äôll see more conversations abt it .... And it finally brings some new entries in to the rare Carvon build category 

Of course, again, thanks to all you guys for making this pretty painless process. Cheers to all that have paid! And to those still with an outstanding balance...they be waiting on you üòâ

i'm just mad so many people wanted these, i was gonna go in for like 10 sets if there wasn't enough interest and mark that shit up later on.

but before we consider this done, i added some additional notes for a bit more visibility, basically some are fully verified because a paypal transaction id was provided.

all others i'm just going by trust.

i know we're good people here but at the same time this GB is exchanging a lot of money.

again, please take a look again and correct me if i'm wrong:

Ladies an gents the sale is officially completed. As of right now!

Everyone that has promised to pay has paid. 

100% participation again! Thnk you!

Your orders are now with Jerry. I‚Äôll keep you posted on your orders...so, yeah....that means bug me not Jerry. Getting the monies on time, without stragglers just makes the process better for everyone. Thank you for paying on time. 

For the people that missed out on this unique opportunity, I‚Äôm sorry. It was definitely a  ‚Äúseize the day‚Äù moment when I posted up and was really only allotted 25 sets...which ended up 30 sets. (Yeah I begged for the extra for you guys) and you guy sucked it up in abt 3 hours...fucking insane! Blew my mind. (Also, I noted who missed out...if something should come up...I will PM you direct)

Ever since Jerry‚Äôs KS, Carvon has slipped away from the DIY scene...Not sure if Jerry wants to be full blown back to DIY, but for now...I‚Äôll be the buffer as long as you guys are interested in just the drive system. So, keep posted. I‚Äôll do my best to give you some good news!

- are those out-runners
- what about impact protection / resistance (looking for outer housing material & thickness + influence of bend on performance
- what is a bearing solution here (depends on outrunner / inrunner etc) 
- for your motors that is a max RMS phase current continuous / 20s / 5s
- heat rejection
- water resistance ( I don't expect it to be IP69K but whenever this will survive occasional puddle - I'm based in UK so this kinda matters)

Hey I don't think anyone is going to answer these except maybe that they're outrunners and will have a silicone/polyurethane sleeve to protect the can.

These motors are small batch custom made at factories building for hobby applications, so there won't be industrial spec sheets.

As far as i know they're using SK3 outrunners as a starting point. They have a protecting sleeve on the outside. Voltage max is 12S. Outrunners are water resistant, you can even run them underwater without issues (bearings are not water resistant so they will wear faster).

@tomtom13 some info from Jerry 


Motors come from same factory as Sk3 but is highly modified with WYE winding and sensored pcb. Further modding is done for truck and wheel fitment.

As for h2o, they shouldn‚Äôt be ran through it deep. It should be wiped after. 

There will definitely a urethane sleeve by the time the group buy ships.
Motors have 6805 and 608 bearings. 

Sk3 is the motor that Vedder used to develop the VESC, so the motors work very well with VESC. Vedder and manufacturer also met in Germany during development

Pretty much all 63mm sk3 motors with KV < than 200 are 12s LIPOLY (12x4.2v = 50.4v) max. Given that Carvons are wired for 100kv this max will probably go up too.

This.

I'm pretty sure the only voltage limits on motors are for the enamel insulation on the windings, and you're far, far more likely to hit current limits before that even matters...  With that said, a higher voltage will drive more current through the same load, so they may be trying to pre-do some math for you by saying there is a maximum voltage.

## \#362 Posted by: tomtom13 Posted at: 2017-11-01T20:22:23.471Z Reads: 164

```
So technically speaking there are three reasons why you give max V for motor: 
1. @b264 is right, insulation on wiring etc does matter - and there are some very thinly insulated winding wires that will start causing problems at low voltages (~50V) if you provide enough of moisture to stator (moisture will get into cracks that  are created during winding process) 
2. common method with electric motors is to create something called "excitation pulses" to create Eddy current in stator (or rotor depends on which configuration you use) during nearest magnet position to amplify the main field flux on work phase of magnet pass - specifically useful technique on permanent magnet machines to achieve a very high low rpm torque. When you use excitation pulses, since those are square wave of very short duration, these generally create very little current in coils (compared to drive current) so you can use very high voltages for that.
3. Some motors use built in diodes to provide multipole configuration from less driving phases (switch reluctant motors are prime example) and here max voltage would be a diode max reverse voltage. 

I know that this questions might seem over the top for some - I just wanted to know max rating for a motor.

You are correct 

In Carvons case Some of that has to do with the eprm limit in the vesc and can cause a DRV failure 
Moving up in voltage won‚Äôt kill the motor
It will make the motor hit that limit and what use is that to anyone
So from what I understand would need a lower kv motor than what is used now to offset a higher voltage or a vesc with a higher limit üòâ

At the beginning I definitely will use vesc as learning curve for RWD, but going for AWD will require 240A out of battery pack, which makes:
- cabling cumbersome 
- fusing strategy obscure
- any bms way over-engineered 
- to many cells in parallel for my liking (if one cell fails you end up with rest of parallel setup dumping power into it).

It's a third time I've writing this god damn reply ... going from meeting to a f@#%$^@# meeting :/ 

Anyway my plan was to start with 12S graphen lipo for power stability and grow from there. So in the future I might go for higher voltage pack - but that will cause need for different esc. So I want to future proof the setup, and since those motors seem to have a more beefy shafts (no innuendo here) - it looks like a reasonable investment.

I'm with you on most of above, but changing over to graphene only solves the "too many cells" problem? Maybe fusing if you were thinking cell-level. Ar cables if you're building a flexy setup.

Have you seen this?

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a-theory-on-hill-climbing-massive-lipos-dual-6374-and-the-c-word/34437

Oh and if this is your first ride, I've found that even overbuilt, on e-boards things wear out and fail with alarming speed. I'm pretty sure it's not just me (NYC commuter). It's not often brought up directly, but everyone seems to have a pile of broken parts.

 The v3/v4 design looks to address many many issues (beefy shafts lol), but, speaking from experience, I wouldn't count on any e-board lasting forever.

True, but:
when I go for 65C graphens that **_theoretically_** can deplete them self in 55.3 seconds, then I will not get problems with cell temperatures, heat accumulation, issues with regen breaking peaking out voltages and them me trying to "run it out".

about beefy shafts ... sorry, but I was struggling for better term at that time, but I can surely compensate this with "larger rods" or "more girthy poles" ;) (glad is made someone chuckle at least)

back to the subject, in terms of price and stuff breaking my grampa had a saying "everything cheap i more expensive in the long run", which kinda makes sense, if you use hangers with flimsy shafts and you drive torque through those you may lose the wheel, then loose your teeth in the process ... and last time I've checked implants are more expensive than most expensive e-skate motors :) So I understand that nothing lasts forever, I just want to minimise the failure rate on vital components (hence overkill batteries and "beefy shafts") 


ps. don't get me started on C rating :/ yes at 90% C rating may be true but when you get close to true 20% of SOC you can take C rating and divide by 10 easily - so as I said before bms should monitor cell voltages and give current limits to all the motors in setup rather than motors sensing the main bus voltage and users ending up with oscillation.

From my (very recent!) research it looked that way.  I think the direct drive concept is the engineering solution of the future.   Seems like it would retain the best qualities of both outboards and in-wheel hubs.  Im a big guy, but i live in houston where it is flat, so no crazy torque is really necessary so i was leaning towards hubs, but they all seem a little weak. Anyway, i bought a kickstarter board, ionboard x, to be able to skate around with my nephews since they also have boards until i build something.  Its supposed to essentially be an improved meepo.    Supposed to have 9 ply board.  2 x 500w hubs and 350Wh battery.  The price was right... ill probably post a review when it arrives.

Slowly parts are coming in that I'm going to use with the speedrive. Now I was wondering if someone knows what the length of the motor cables (and sensor) is from the base of the truck. Also looking for the size of the motor connectors. So I can already solder the correct ones on the fb. And do I need an adapter to plug the sensor cable in my focbox or is it the correct one outofthebox?

No V4 for verification. I have V3 which is essentially the same except for wheel adapter shape/size

The connectors on the V3 were 3.5mm male bullets. So it should fit the FocBoxes included females. 
The sensor wires was a bit longer BUT I added an adapter because it was too taut. I asked Jerry to make those sensor wires longer since I didn't like the adapter JST connectors outside my enclosure. He said he can ask the factory but might not happen since everything was already in production.

Maybe these pictures will give you an idea![image|371x500](upload://wJqCvbmHjvacq85ONSFfplX4uX4.jpeg)![image|573x500](upload://d069H2tPXQpuxuXDWdDLwSeNk86.jpeg)![image|503x500](upload://yjI9LEwtdwbz3oBpTEOXbIN9Jcv.jpeg)

Yeah I'm pretty dead set on getting these, I only want to build with the best of everything and I don't see any other way of powering these boards other than how Carvon does.  I've got the ESCape's, getting the Photon remote, haven't decided on a board but it'll be sweet, waiting for the Samsung 30T or 40T batteries... I don't want to build an average board and later in build my dream board, I'm going all in the first time, lol.

Don't count your build on something that you don't know if you will be able to get it, if you sadly can't just go dual 6374's still crazy fast
First time you don't want your dream board let me tell you that. A lot of mistakes to learn from which will end up costing u money better to be replaceable parts then a exspensive dream board that I am going for as well. From hours of adjusting and learning what's the right motor mount position, and playing with vesc settings and frying a vesc , and some how managing to ruin 8 tb motors

Bad idea you want higher kV because this is belt not hub its not a 1/1 ratio, if you did that with standard gear ratio most common 16/36 you would only
Reach 19mph for such of a overkill fast build.
Also yes its tragic but its most likely no one is going to give up there carvon drives they paid a big price and waited for a long time,  and only a certain amount were sold like 30 I believe.

If you could fit a 6384 stator 4000W, and magnets into a Carvon XL, what kv would you go with?  Dual, and 4WD.

I think dual I'd do 100kv and 4WD I'd go 115-120kv.

Since the 4WD Evo has dual 2500w 110kv, I think with the power these others have could allow for another 5-10kv and still have much more torque, right? 

To speed would be like 60mph, lol..

Both motors are what they are, kv wise because changing the motors from delta to wye results in them.  149 turned from delta to wye is 85, and 190 turned from delta to wye is 110.  Since the Stators are from Turnigy and those are kv's that they offer in their SK3 Aerodrive models, that's why the kv is what it is on the Carvon's.

It‚Äôs somewhat odd that you didn‚Äôt get the torque drives. I think a few ordered recently and got it a few days later. @mmaner didn‚Äôt you do that?

@b264 I have had success reaching out to Jerry and Joe. They are the only ones I know there as it‚Äôs basically a one man show with a little help, @joeadams101 being one of them. Parts are sourced in China which has been on vacation for a month due to their ‚ÄúNew Year‚Äù. Everyone should just be returning now and catching up on communications. I know it been said before. But patience is all they can ask for while getting these parts made correctly and up to Jerry‚Äôs standard.

I have tons a of patience.  You don't even know why I've attempted to contact them.  But that doesn't change the facts that *they haven't answered any communication at all from me* (not one thing, ever, on any medium or to any person) *or someone else who has already filed a claim against them.  Ironically, they respond instantly when a claim is filed.  They magically appear...*

I can assure you that putting this here publicly was a forced last resort because I'm actually a large fan of Carvon.

I guess, but if you use a threat as a way of getting a response then you may as well just get your money refunded and walk away. 

Though rare, CarvOn updates on their current issues on their site so it‚Äôs just best to read it here and wait. Don‚Äôt forget how Jason/Enertion was and still is.

The inability to get a respone is weird and frustrating for sure. Especially for a high end boutique vendor with a loyal and rabid fan base, to have gone on essentially a communications blackout. Especially difficult if you think your order has been forgotten, or you're moving, etc.

Seems like this happens to many vendors for whatever reason. I'm glad hummie and onloop are still talking to people.

I'm hoping they prioritize communications as they hire more people.

When it says "out of stock" the price listed is effectively meaningless.  If Jerry ever puts it for sale, he will probably set the price at that time.  If he has the SD R listed and the R -> XL upgrade listed for sale, I wouldn't think he'd mind if you did that.  But I don't know.

@Exiledd_Top I think it would be a good idea if Jerry appointed you as an updater on the forum since you do some work at the shop and are consistently on the forum. Right now my assumption is the people like @DilatedPupils got a tracking number because boxes are prepped and drives were about to go out but snagged on production issues? It‚Äôs one thing if Jerry is not here, but because you are here and get a paycheck from CarvOn we expect you to relay the concerns and hopefully provide an insight. Anything is better than the nothing

Providing a tracking number is easy, I literally have boxes of tracking stickers/numbers at the office, but useless until the post office scans it.

**"the only thing that we were missing is urethane and were doing it in house which was Impossible so the factory got back to us and it looks good"**

There you go. That's the update of what the hold up is.

As someone who has been at the shop and have also have the drives. I would say that waiting for the final urethane sleeve is worth it because those "in-house" ones are not exactly quality, does the job, but could be better. I can confirm that there were drives that are made and on the shelf.

I don't get why they don't let people know of the holdup and let the customer choose if they want a urethane sleeve or not. To be honest, urethane or not the motors will eventually get dinged anyways.

That doesn't mean that all of the motors are just waiting for urethane though. Some could still be in production. Same with the XL. 

It would be nice to know how many outstanding orders are left, and what his output per day.

I think the reason is that Jerry wants these drive to hold up or he would end up having them shipped back to him for repairs and warranty claims. He wants to release the most robust possible drives.

When I visited two weeks ago, there were some XL motors on the tables but not assembled yet, I think it was an axle fitment issue? 

I do agree that there's a problem with their communication aspect that definitely needs improvement. These drives are great, but how many times can I say that and defend it if no one else get theirs?!

Okay Peeps we almost there for all you people saying we ain't doing anything. Sorry for all people waiting I understand your frustration but it is either perfect or it's a no go because were trying to
avoid people  doing stupid shit with them and then  claiming  faulty and having to ship it to us so we are putting urethane,  heat treated axles set us back alot because they didn't fit and had to be machined one by one to fit  , and urethane was being done in house but finally we got a rubber factory to do it and are satisfied never the less let pictures speak for themselves.

We are thankful for your updates man, we are just frustrated with the fact that Carvon as a whole knows that their customers are frustrated and want updates and yet they choose to ignore it.

What we all should be afraid of is that "CarvOn" is essentially ONE person, he has one guy still in school who helps out when he can and another guy who helps with videos when he can. Hopefully LHB will be able to churn the EVOs out quickly when he gets the parts....but at the end of the day It's just Jerry because everyone else has a day job or school.

This is kinda the reason Enertion went the China route. Maybe this needs to happen with CarvOn when he creates the next project.

they are better than v3 better fan, usually if u hit them really really hard that's usually the first thing that wouldn't break but bend. I would know because besides the broken magnet my fans that took the impact slightly bent, went out of the way to make sure they don't bend at all and designed them so not even a 60mph accident would break the fan. flux ring better and a different way of holding the Strator more structure integrity

I don't want to talk shit about Jerry. He does him and I do me. But I don't think he'll come back to the forum. Everyones different, but it seemed he's not the type. TBH, anyone trying to build electric skateboard stuff is a little out there, including me. Everyone reacts differently to responses of others about your product. I think he doesn't feel comfortable here, and decides to avoid it. I think it would beneficial to his business to be here. But he also has ambassadors in a sense, so carvon will do fine without his presence here.

hey @chris.hunt since you literally rode my three builds the other day, what would be your input? CarvOn was the silent FOC one

To be fair, here are the boards:

10s3p 16T/36T 90mm Dual 6355 UNsenored BLDC (Raptor 1)
10s3p 97mm CarvOn V4 Sensored FOC
12s3p 18T/36T 97mm Dual 6374 UNsensored BLDC

the carvon had a much smoother throttle even if you nailed it however once you got up to speed it felt like there wasn‚Äôt much room to go faster

the dual 6374‚Äôs has a smooth throttle but felt quite a bit faster than the carvons when you nailed it also when you got up to speed there was still quite a lot to play with

i don‚Äôt remember much about the dual 6355 board sorry :(

fwiw my dual carvon v2.5 maxed with 97mm wheels on 10s maxed out around 32mph. I'm like 190lb. In theory XL has same stator and winding, and should be similar for top speed.

The R's top speed should be quite a bit higher. IIRC 38-42mph?

For feel on dual v2.5, it's weak off the line but once it gets going it pulls harder and harder up to the max.

For comparison I'm running dual 6355 190kv 16/36 with the rest being the same, and it's way way faster off the line, but, from memory, the v2.5 were stronger once you got going, maybe north of 20mph.

Brakes were not enough when going 25mph+ on 2.5, but I think I could have safely gotten more via vesc settings.

Again, what do you mean no load?
If you mean that there wasn't anybody riding the board or that it was revving upside down on a bench, then these numbers are far from real world. 
You have sooo many losses you're not even accounting for. I doubt they're capable of reaching more than 45 loaded.

Not all orders are in transit. Some order labels, like mine, got misplaced... so there's still V4 SD Rs that haven't shipped.

@Exiledd_Top i told you a week ago, but clearly i was wrong...

[quote="thisguyhere, post:640, topic:36289"]
what about startup torque?
[/quote]

dual v2.5 was not very good off the  line. dual belt 6355 crushes it easily.

But, there's hope. With the temperature sensor in these motors, and if you're running the firmware from Vesc-tool (vesc6), and if you have a very high discharge capable pack, you can significantly increase a lot of the amperage parameters, and let thermal throttling keep you from blowing up the vesc or the motors.  @BigBoyToys

the noise to clarify is the spacer inside the Strators, it has to be to the exact cut I forgot the mm  size let's just say it's 15mm I cut all of them for a entire day and it's hard to cut them to the exact mm for the fact the cut is a side cut with a indentation, that's the rattle u hear if it's off by .10 of a mm it will rattle nothing to be alarmed about still silent
if you so remove motor can you will not be able to put them back on endless you have 15ton press.
@trancejunkiexxl removed them and couldn't put them back in it's impossible

I can‚Äôt seem to get a definite answer from Chris Chaput on when he‚Äôs going to do the hangers for the XL. I really don‚Äôt want to make a big fuss about this, but I‚Äôm being put between a rock and a hard place. I know it‚Äôs none of you guys‚Äô concern but that‚Äôs where things are at right now.

I‚Äôm just gonna go to Xometry again. It will take around 15 business days, but at least they keep to their schedules. I‚Äôm really sorry about the delay. If you know a CNC shop with fast turn-around and decent pricing, I‚Äôd be interested. I order at least 100 pieces.

If you can‚Äôt wait to buy abec flywheels locally you can buy them from the EU stores. I don‚Äôt think the price will be in your liking though. 

@e.board_solutions

You can select 97 from the drop down. You may want to hit him up directly in case he can do something for you price wise.

How are your temps guys? I litteraly can't ride because I always have thermal throttling like 5 mins into my ride I can't accelerate anymore
I can't climb hills either when I could easily with my V3 normally 
I heard it's beacause 2.18 don't read motor temps but I m not sure what it is 
If other owners could share their temps it would be super cool

The Motor reach 80¬∞ in not even 5 10 mins ( riding gentle, just hard acceleration not insane speeds) I will put the heat limit to 110 degrees and I ll be fine.

Are you on 2.18? Vesc on 2.18 just ignores motor temps

[/quote]

the battery values should be whatever is safe for your pack, divided by 2 if dual vesc.

- for discharge, 30q is rated for 15a, 20a seems okay based on internet wisdom. If your pack is built to handle it, 5*20=100a. If dual 50a each.

- for charge, samsung says .5a normal charge 4a fast charge. The safe value for batt min is 5*4a=-20a. You can likely push this without harm, but you're out of the safe zone. The super safe value is 5*.5a=-2.5a

For motor amps, I believe if you have the motor temperature sensors hooked up, it'll throttle when hot, so you can wander into higher values somewhat safely?

I rode my board for a bit last night, i've gotta say, im surprised how smooth it is. Although the sound is still there and id like to get that sorted.

@ElskerShadow did you tighten the wheel nut all the way? I did that when i first put in the wheels and realized that one of the motors wasn't as free as without the wheel. Im used to bearing spacers so i always crank down on the nut, but i dont believe the motor has a spacer inside so if you crank the nut it will deform either the outside or inside bearing.

I had the same clicking weird noise on one side of my drive. It started after a few miles of riding. Felt like something was loose in there.
Could also feel every magnet when spinning and that reduced freewheel for that side.

I loosened the wheel nut a bit and retightened, and now the weird noise and magnetic feel are gone!
I will take it for a spin later today to see if it starts happening again.

I'm not sure of the importance of motor detection without pulleys, I generally just remove the heavy wheel and do detection, that has worked as far as I know. For the Carvons I left the wheel adapter on and detection worked as well.

Maybe the whole "do not spin motor" thing is just a precaution as the wheel and axle nut presses everything together?

try taking it off all the way and checking inside, if it all looks well put it all the way back on with some screws and see if the clicks stop, if they do, use some loctite and rescrew it down.

Okay guys, thanks to @treenutter I can post again.

To @JohnnyMeduse, your drive is on the way. Sorry for the wait, kinda misplaced your shipping label. 

"Do not spin the drives under power without putting a wheel on it and locking it with the axle nut."

The wheel and nut needs to be on to square up the rotor, otherwise it will pull out.

The noise on the V3 was because the wheel needed some tape in the driver for the clicking noise that I had during startup and hard acceleration.
What is happening now is both motor have strong resistance, with a clic at each magnet, there's no freewheel and it's hard to turn the motor (see my video posted earlier today). The weird thing is that it will somewhat disappear for some time and come back from nowhere.
And lastly I have some serious heat throttling issue with the drive, it's hard to climb any little hill. Do you still recommend running at 80A? I Never had any throttling on my V3's.. 
I am glad to see you again in the forum anyway :)

This is what happens when you spin it too fast without the wheel and axle nut on. Have to have the wheel and nut to block the rotor from pushing out.

That's definitely weird as all motors are tested before shipping. I would definitely feel it if there is some drag. Can you check the bearings on the motor? It may have come off and not mounted on properly

Yes. We have to pause offering them as we concentrate on the completes. Once we get a handle on the orders for the completes and if we get extras in the future, we may offer them again.

But I expect we will also be busy taking care of complete orders, pre and post sales. We need to focus attention so that we can serve everybody better.

Jerry, so glad to see you back on the forum. And especially with an XL update. I had heard from a little bird that the hanger schedule was behind with Chris, but that was like 6 months ago. I guess the XL's were always behind the Speed Drives, so hopefully it won't be long now. 

PS, I recently got my hands on Rik's (@runplayback) single V2.5 setup and it is really smooth and surprisingly powerful for a single motor. And amazingly quiet on FOC. So cool. My wife was watching me cruise up and down the street and still had to ask me if it my board was really electric. 

And speaking of that, do you happen to have any single V2.5 cored drive wheels in 90 or 97mm, possibly Abec 11, still around that you'd want to sell? If so, I'll take this to PM's.

Okay, I will try to finish your other drive right away and send them out ASAP. I'll take a video of it to make sure everything is in order.

Once you get them, you can compare it to what you have right now. Then if what you have is still problematic, then you can send that back to me and I'll take care of it. 

You can open up the motor, just remove the four small screws around the back of the rotor. Then pull straight so as not to scratch the stator. The hard part is putting the rotor back with the bearing on like that in the picture.

EDIT:  If you can find a tube with a 10mm OD and 8mm ID, then you can slip it onto the axle and it will be easier to put the rotor with the bearing back on.

I only ran the drives without a wheel and nut for motor detection.
I did ride with one of the motors unpowered for a little bit when the power to its focbox disconnected, probably for like 5 minutes tops. Do you think this might have caused it?

As to fixing it I have to remove the screws and then just push it in and retighten?
I don't need a press or any special tools?

I actually remember reading it before that you should do motor detection with wheels on, I think Frank of Trampa posted it...not 100% sure though.

So yes, do motor detection with wheels on. It will give a more accurate reading.

You don't have to remove the motor if you just want to push the rotor back towards center. Just put the wheel and the spacer between the wheel and motor to push the wheel, then crank the axle nut. tight. If the wheel does not turn easily because you tightened the axle nut too much, then put some speed rings between wheel and spacer.

The rotor will be pushed towards the center via the middle of the bearing, and by the hub of the wheel itself. Everything should line up and be supported by the axle nut.

@LEVer good to have you posting! I think you relieved a whole bunch of pressure for a ton of people :slight_smile:

As people are receiving their drives, can you give some starting points for vesc settings?

- blcd-tool or vesc-tool, or ackmaniac?

- motor amps SD-R vs XL

- foc vs bldc, sensors, motor temp sensor?

- current + brake? or current + brake + reverse? I read somewhere more braking power was available with reverse enabled?

- 4wd considerations

Thanks man.

are you SD, XL? 2WD, 4WD?

Asking because I'm also in the process of configuring. Would like to see how others are planning on setting theirs up. 

I am running 4WD SD. Was advised to split power 70 (rear) /30 (front) for accel, and 30 (rear)/70 (front) braking.

The plan is, "yes"? At least once, for science.

But the real build is probably XL 2wd (I'm too fat for 2wd SD-R, 4wd is just too heavy and too much $$$ to lose at once).

Great info on power split. I'll add to the list above.

Most of these things will be limited by your battery and not your motors.

Motors can take 2250w (XL) and 2500w(SD), so thats about 30A-40A at 12S.
You would need 4P 25R or 6P 30Q cells to get there.

Im running my motors in FOC unsensored (in my mind its just more thing that can go wrong), current+brake. Bldc-Tool for me for now, last i read vesc-tool had some weirdness with the breaks.

I'm so busy building that I still program with the BLDC-tool :sweat_smile: I haven't heard anybody having problems with the other apps though. Derek especially liked the Ackmaniac's because of the reverse function. He felt like he needed the reverse to fully stop (actually, to go back up again) when going downhill because he was big a dude.

For SDR, my motor Max/Min is 80A/-120A. For SDXL 60A/-80A. The XL has more drag when you let go of the throttle than the R (because of the lower kv) so you don't need to crank up the braking that much. It also has more resistance, again due to low kv, so I don't recommend going faster than 35 mph on them because too much speed heats up the XL.

I only do FOC, super quiet and I feel having better control on the motors. Definitely use the sensors, better startup and better braking. I actually haven't used the temp sensors. Look up Derek's thread cause I believe he posted his temperature parameters somewhere.

I ride with no reverse as I'm experienced and light enough to know how to fully stop in most situations. I also foot-brake below 3 mph, I'm not on the board 100% of the time. But if you need to do frequent and hard braking, like if you live on a hill or a very crowded urban area, then I will recommend going with reverse.

4WD with R is the ultimate ride. You get both speed "and" torque. Take off and braking is instantaneous as well as traction cause you use the grip of the 4 wheels. Turning is also more amazing as you can slow down in the middle of the turn if you think you're gonna go wide, and then crank it up again to re-align your exit. With 2WD, you almost need to fully stop if you entered the turn going too fast. 4WD with XL is kinda pointless because it will just double up the torque and make the board super heavy. 

If you really, really, really need just torque...you shouldn't do a direct-drive, a geared down system will provide all the torque that you need at half the weight. @psychotiller has a sweet 4WD belt-drive setup with SixShooters and mini 50mm motors. It takes off like a rocket and will not dislodge your arm from your shoulders when you carry it.

Yup, 12s is highly recommended for SpeedDrives and min 3p for 2WD and 5p for 4WD. Highly recommend 30Q cells.

10s is recommended for TorqueDrive and min of 2p with 30Q. Use bigger wheels like 107mm+ to go faster.

let's see to begin with boosted motors are stupid small and are okay but not high performance, you could probably dust most high powered  diy electric skateboards here the torque am not sure but I've ridden 2wd speed drives and 4wd , you leave anyone in the dust stupid fast and dangerious

This is the size of Boosted ‚Äòs motor the gearing is what gives it that torque. But the motors we use in this community are better in many ways.  ![image|634x499](upload://c0x0B8dgUNGvZZacfa2lDf5wHg5.jpeg)

I still plan to outsource production, but this will greatly help when I'm waiting on those parts or they arrive out-of-spec. Expecting to finish all SpeedDrive R orders this week and start shipping a few of the XL next week. Just like you guys, I can't stand waiting.

Pretty soon. We will start selling the Drives as kits, so you guys will have to assemble them yourselves. You'll need to buy the hanger with the axle, and they buy the other parts to complete them. This will make it easier to diagnose/fix them. So if you have a problem with the stator, you can just buy the stator. If you need just a new rotor, then you can just buy that. If you need new urethane sleeves, or a different wheel adapter, you can just buy those.

Does anyone have some tips on focbox settings to get better braking?
Have a v4 speeddrive R with a 10s4p 30Q pack (Upgrading to 12s soon)  97mm wheels
Running latest Ackmaniac firmware (3.102) with FOC.

Current settings:
Current no reverse with break
Motor max 60
Motor min -60

Battery current max 25
Max regen -10

Just basic settings for testing, but want to change the motor max and min to 75 -75 and battery to 30 and max regen to  -16 or -20.
Any opinions or suggestions on getting better brakes?

## \#932 Posted by: deucesdown Posted at: 2018-07-07T17:03:36.836Z Reads: 197

Diet :slight_smile:

The only things you can do is increase motor max for low speed brakes, and increase batt min for high speed brakes. Motor temperature sensor should help protect the motors.

For batt min, 30q has 1.5a safe charge, 4a max charge. At 4p max is -16a total, or -8 per motor. So at -16 per motor you're already at 2x the manufacturer specified max. Personally I'd keep going until brakes felt at least somewhat safe, but with the understanding that I could shorten pack life or even cause a fire. IMO.

Other ways to get more brakes:
- diet ;)
- XL (but I don't think it'll be a dramatic difference)
- 4wd
- add mechanical brakes
- battery pack that can take more regen current

EDIT the cells can probably take a lot more regen if they're say below 50% full. The more full they are the more they'll not enjoy high current charge.

wondering where you read that.  ?  sounds logical but never read about overcharging cells and at different states of charge.  anyone do testing?    maybe lipos will last longer given how much people expect of ion cells on a board sometimes.

_Disclaimer:  These are second hand V4 that I purchased from Exiledd_Top, and found out after I purchased that they are apparently the ones that were involved in "[the crash](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/may-u-rest-in-pieces-4wd-evo/55373?u=moros)".  So I don't know what he has done to them or how much was replaced etc etc_

Because these are second hand I took the cans off today to have a look and make sure everything was good.
Also because I was curious.
While I was looking around I noticed the hall sensor wires on one side had been glued in place at a bad angle causing the wires to touch the outside plate that spins with the can.

![Touchytouchy|373x500](upload://qucu0PcgAnpG8MXq5fPPwvsWVQe.jpg)

I can imagine a stationary wire touching a metal plate spinning at a high RPM will eventually eat away at the plastic and create a problem.

![Touchytouch|690x420](upload://6W6htxoIJgGwMFbrTDxPgQb4lup.jpg)

Because the wires are glued in place at an angle pointing them away from the center of the axle where they pass through to the outside.
I pulled them off and away but if the cable gets pulled from the outside then the wires get pulled back into the side.  So I will need to glue them in place to prevent them from being able to touch.

For comparison here is the other side that has no issues.

![NoTouchyTouchy|690x321](upload://oCXfENgJlnH2csfExR0zeUcyHIA.jpg)

Because the wires are glued in place facing the center of the axle already, they are unable to touch anything they shouldn't, even if the wires are pulled from the outside.

Wanted to share in case anyone else has this issue.
Warning, if you take your can off you will need a metal sleeve to slide over the axle so the bearing in the cans are able to glide back onto the lip it sits on.
Without it the magnets pulling will make it quite a challenge to get it back in place.

I wish I forgot but I'm just plain ignorant. I'm kind of scared to go down the regen rabbithole. But I'm so curious about voltage, etc...

So when vesc reports -16a battery current in telemetry, it's not -16a on the battery wire? I can imagine an 80% gap during regen between motor amps and battery amps, but would have though live data about battery amps would be about in the ballpark?

I think hummies point is that the energy has to go somewhere. Initially during acceleration, energy stored in the battery gets converted to the kinetic energy of the moving board and person, but during braking, if only 20% of that energy is returning to the battery, then the remaining 80% has to go somewhere else. I'd assume heat, but that seems like more than is reasonable. The issue is even worse if you apply power to the motor to slow it, since you are expending even more energy that will end up being converted to some other form(heat?).

Regenerative braking does not put current into the motor.  It's the same as holding the motor in your hand with the 3 phases connected together -- it's really, really hard to turn.  The mechanical energy is being converted to heat in the phase wires (and windings).

If you instead connect it to a battery through 6 one-way junctions then the battery will be charged by the mechanical motion.

I think there's a boost converter or some voltage regulation involved, as the voltage in the "generator" must be higher than the battery (water cannot flow uphill).

So some heat in the mechanical -> electrical conversion in the windings, some heat in the boost circuit, and some in the switching in the fets as usual? I don't really know/understand how the current limits are applied.

Haha talking completely out my ass. But maybe someone who knows stuff will get triggered and post actual info. :slight_smile:

You'd have to look at the source code for your firmware to see exactly what it's doing, but my best guess is that below battery voltage, it's shorting the leads together (burning off the energy as heat in the windings) and above battery voltage it's sending it to the BMS to charge the battery.

i think when braking the voltage coming from the motor will always be below battery voltage unless the motor were spinning faster than the no-load speed.
if when braking it were just shorting i think that would be a huge amount of power to dissipate in the windings

Nice simple explanation that's somewhat intuitive. It's from a comment in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhOEoXfxHMc) which is completely useless

As I know, regenerative brakes does not uses the energy to charge the battery, the energy used is to charge boost caps, and the when to start moving, you use the energy stored in the super caps to move the car (becuase the maximum amps consumption of a motor is when it's stopped) and once you are moving, the motor will move with the battery. And the regenerative brakes does not only stops the car with the generator, but with disk brakes too. Anyway, good video, you expalined the principle very well Ôªø

Yeah... No
Have you ever made a brushed generator? Essentially you spin a coil of wire between two magnets and the magnetic field generates a current on the wire which can be turned into useful power. I made one in a Science fair project when I was like 10...

Any brushless motor can be turned into a generator, all you need is a way to rectify the voltage... If only we had some kind of switching regulator to control the voltage and current output of the generator. Oh wait. We do. It's called an ESC.

Hehe speaking of triggered ;) Come on in the water's warm.

Thanks, the rectification thing helps me digest this. But regen braking seems way more "controlled" than mere generation.

Hahaha. Yes definitely more controlled than a simple generator mainly because the output voltage is pegged to the battery voltage. 

But the principle stands. Yes. That video applies. Control theory is awesome but it is extremely complicated if you're simply trying to understand how regen works. 

Its like a kid asking why apples fall from trees at a certain speed and you going into relativity and then into the aerodynamics of an apple. 

Yes all of that is relevant but at the same time its just superfluous information when you could get away with a much simpler explanation. 

In layman terms. Regen breaking is achieved by doing the exact opposite of driving a motor by the esc. An ESC driving a motor converts electrical power to mechanical power. An ESC controlling a generator converts mechanical power to electrical power. 

Source: I also work with hybrid electric uav systems where brushless motors are used as generators to charge batteries.

If u ask me keep your V3, V3 have one weakness it's the fan inside, if you hit the rotor can too hard it can break.
If you have good roads, it will never happen. 
The V4 has an urethane sleeve over the rotor can so the heat has less space to escape. Since on the V3 the rotor can is in direct contact with the air.
My 2 cents. 
The V4 are as well really great just I have to raise my temperature cutoff to 110*

You mentioned that the V4 torque drives can do pneumatics, Do they need to be 4WD to do so? I‚Äôd like more torque without belts so I was keen on the V4 TDs.

I was planning to go 10s5p or 10s6p but can I go beyond 10s for the TD‚Äôs? Thanks for engineering these awesome drives. It‚Äôs definitely going on my first ever build but the TB direct drives do look promising as well

Yeah the deck was the only thing that they have going for them. About a year after ordering it I received a broken board (essentially a deck), which was sent back to  Florida from California at my expense over 6 times, coming back still unfunctional each. The last time they kept it saying we will wait until the new 2.0 comes out and give it to you for free. That was 8 months ago. Since then I have begged them just to send back my deck that I sent in and be done with it..... they refused

I had bought a board in December 2015 from Marbel too. After cutting communication with me, I finally called my credit card provider and had it reversed. They said that they tried to reach out to marbel and was being ignored as well.

Luckily I had used my credit card so I was able to get the money back... I think it is crazy that they are still trying to sell boards even though they probably never squared up with the credit companies who are probably bugging them for the money.

Jerry‚Äôs is in North Hollywood these days so about an hour away? Production wise. I have no idea what the hold up is. It makes no sense why a hanger takes this long even just one or two should‚Äôve been sent out by now. I mean we have a guy who didn‚Äôt like the Raptor 2 hanger and basically made one the same day....Maybe @SeanHacker should make the hangers?

Isn't the XL hanger literally the exact same shape as the R version, just like 20mm longer?  Like how is this possible, lol.  I think it was in January I read on their site how they had to remachine the hangers, but they'd be ready in like two weeks...  Effing six months later and still nothing, with no word!?  FTW :confused:

I don't frequent this website. I almost never read PM's here and haven't for about a year. I have an email address and a phone number that I use and check daily. I don't have a 12mm Carvon axle so I made my own on the CNC lathe that is precisely 12mm in diameter and it slips into the reamed hole in the hanger nicely.

When someone emails me or picks up the phone, gets me an axle, and approves the hanger design, I'll make a production run.

These torque drives however might make me feel a lot better again. 
The torque of the 75kv meepo hubs are pretty awesome so to get the same with direct drives would float my boat.

Especially since they are waiting for the parts. Im sure when we finally hear another update it will be something that makes no sense like "we didn't have time to post updates because we had to put our nose down and work to get these out"

Hey guys I just got my v4s and after about 15 miles I noticed the wheel insert had some play in it. Upon further inspection I realized that 2/5 threads were stripped. It seems like no loctite was used during the initial assembly. I'm going to try tapping the threads. Hopefully I won't run into any issues running bigger bolts.

Playing with the idea of going 4WD. Would anyone even be interested in this deal?

Trade someone my spot in line for XL (ordered in December) for a new speed drive R (or place in line for speed drive R) and $200. If someone takes this deal I‚Äôll probably just go 4wd, if not I‚Äôll just build a new board with it. I really don‚Äôt need both. This might work well for someone who is concerned that the R may not have enough torque/brakes.

Ok guys fwiw I bought a Carvon EVO 4WD from Jerry last month and have been reading many threads Including the Indiegogo thread that I posted below from people concerned and worried so I tried to help since I have more than just an email for Jerry so here goes..

Jerry responded to me via text, he has my personal cell # so you all can breath...he's NOT running away with your money...please someone post this on indiegogo and Kickstarter cause I wasn't a backer  then and it won't let me..this is what I texted Jerry and following is his response..

Chris: Hi Jerry hope all is good..I'm getting many emails and private messages from your backers on the Carvon's..they say you haven't met release date promises and no updates from you in 2 months they feel like they got screwed...man I hate to think like that you were professional with me and I don't want to believe what I'm reading but please if there's a delay of some sort please tell them..I know you're a man of your word and will do what's best but please please please respond to your backers on this issue..I thank you for understanding..here is a thread running and your backers screaming for updates or a refund..https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/carvon-exo-pro-the-next-gen-electric-skateboard-drones#/comments

Jerry: Hey Chris, yes I'm working hard on it, thanks for letting me know. Some suppliers have been unreliable so we had to resort on doing it ourselves..We're doing something this weekend so I'll address them really really soon..I want to show progress. Just don't want to come out empty-handed..Ôªø

That response from Jerry is insane.  He's blaming 'unreliable suppliers' for these delays, and then his reasoning for not giving updates is because he 'doesn't want to come out empty handed'.  What a rediculous thing to say.  As if his customers need something tangible to be satisfied or something?  A simple 'We had some delays due to an unreliable supplier' would have been a welcomed update for all waiting on any news regarding the status of these drives. His complete lack of updates and zero contact with any customers kinda puts him in the 'unreliable supplier' category in my opinion...

I hear ya bro and I feel your pain...

I am very disappointed that this happened myself and I wasn't a backer either..I was a backer on the Raptor 2 and had to wait a year for that one as well but at least we had updates bi-weekly if not weekly, Jason was very professional even though he had major delays and there are some backers who still don't have one almost 2 years later so go figure..

Jerry IMO should come out and say something this week to all his backers even if it's bad news, you guys deserve better and also have to make a decision on what to do and honestly if I had to wait this long I wouldn't, I'd be fighting with my credit card company for a charge-back...just my 2 cents.

I'm not sure what the hell Jerry is doing or how he processes the things I tell him via text.

I've been able to get certain people to connect with him and successfully transfer some purchases. I've advised him to update the forum on many occasions and was told that he would get to it. I've also asked him to update those EXO and EXP Pros that we have heard nothing about. He seems to evades those products so I have no idea what the hold up is with those.

I've gotten 2 out of the 3 things I've purchased. He's definitely not here to scam people, he just doesn't seem to understand the transparency that we seek.

Here's another question to moderators. Has this thread now turned into "vendor bashing"? @mmaner @Michaelinvegas? what do you think?

Not normal in general business, but normal when it comes to Jerry. He pretty much ignores most emails that doesn't stand out because with one set of hands he chooses either build parts, assemble things or in this case, update the shop.

One of the recommendation from others is to put something in the subject line that stands out.

I have been out of the Carvon game for months. I really can‚Äôt comment on anything. Hence my nearly zero interaction with this thread since i have been back.

I am sorry.

Guess it's just me and the DMs then huh. I'll relay certain messages as some of you have experienced but if I do it too often I would just become part of that email "problem". 

As mentioned before the XLs are in Chris's court now and once CNC is done it will be back to Jerry.

I will say this in regards to the EXO and EXO Pros. There's an update as to what the delay is, the solution is being sought out at the moment and once that's done, a proper update will be provided.

Its so funny. Preordering a set of Carvon XLs was my first es8 purchase last november or whatever. I have since finished (or close to finished at least) 3 fairly significant builds, for me at least, and have many others on the docket.

Glad I didn't hold my breath for those XLs.....

[/quote]

@Mikenopolis this thread started as a group buy. Group buys are the exception to the guideline about order delivery and vendor interactions. Since the sale starts on the forum this is the expected place for the vendor to communicate w the buyers. If this thread has flipped pls let us know. We can close this and start fresh - so long as all the buyers have another way to communicate w the seller.

This thread is probably the only reason why lots of us have not just charged back our purchases from Carvon.  The forum is also the only reason I bought from them initially.  Many members like @RunPlayBack made awesome boards with Carvon drives, and their posts on the forum helped me decide that I wanted Carvon drives for my next project.

I‚Äôm in the group buy for the xl‚Äôs.  And this is the only place I get communication about a 9 month old order that‚Äôs yet to be filled.  

I‚Äôm ok waiting. I bought a raptor 1, so I know how to wait.  But it‚Äôs also fair let others know what‚Äôs happening, and how Carvon operates.  The free exchange of information and opinion is what make this forum the awesome place it is.

Stating communication issues or delivery delays in a factual manner is not vendor bashing.  And if a vendor chooses not to respond they just lose future sales to more active vendors.

It is a Jerry thing that we cannot control. I'm sure we've all advised him to post updates, but as @b264 has said, it's his choice to run the customer relations part of his business like this which sheds a negative light.

I chose to assist him by relaying messages and stuff, but there's only so much I can do without knowing all the facts. I think his thought process is that he doesn't update unless there's positive news, so if solutions are still being sought out, he holds back on updates

Okay guys, I finally have some time to sit down and post updates. For EXO Pro, the update is up on IGG.

![20180730_221941|690x388](upload://ngDkQwLx3iHKJj64AFrwnZAKQGN.jpg)

I have been machining an extended wheel adapter to lessen the urethane cover on the SpeedDrive. If you would like to use it please check https://www.carvonskates.com/collections/parts/products/extended-wheel-adapters-for-speeddrive

You can use a 3" pipe cutter to cut the urethane or you can send it to us and we can put it on the lathe and cut it. You can also opt to run the motors without urethane sleeves, just be careful and choose the roads you ride on.

Some tips to lessen heat issue:

1. Use at least 12s, it gets you up to speed right away and makes it easier for the motors once it's spinning fast.
2. Opt for 90mm wheels.
3. Optimal rider weight is 200lb (90kg) as written on our product page.
4. Consider going 4wd. The urethane was added primarily for those that will do a 4WD.

I recall a major reason given for a large portion of the delay was so that the urethane sleeves could be made so that the customers don't mess up the motors from rocks and debris hitting them, which would result in many of them being sent back for being damaged.  The way it was worded if I recall was they were to protect Carvon from having to deal with a bunch of damage caused by the customers.  So now saying that the sleeves are bad and the drives can be used without them is quite contradictory.  Also, these new extended sleeves, only cover what, 1/3rd of the motor, leaving the rest in urethane...  If they're so bad, why not make a fully covered metal sleeve that is replaceable, and leave the adapter as it is?   This seems like a partial solution...

That was my V2. I prefer the motors to have urethane cover at least in the center of the truck, which is the area that gets hit more often. The complete boards will come with urethane covers, but since you guys are "DIYers" and know what you are doing, I trust that you guys will take care of it better than the average riders. In any case, the solution can be different for each DIY rider, since the drives are paired with different configurations.

To be honest, the 4WD will be out first since we already have the enclosure for it. We are deciding on which enclosure to use for the EVO 2wd, but we will decide within this week. Then order the enclosures.

Also, the EVO 2wd will have the new Falcon deck. We want the 2wd to look different from the 4wd

@Lever great to heat the good progress, difficult getting these out the door but looks like you have found a path.

Hoping forum members will keep the Q&A reasonable so that you can also stay on point regarding deliverables.

Would ask forum members who are not actual customers awaiting fulfillment to hold their commentary to a reasonable level so that @LEVer can put all his efforts on current existing actual customer orders.  Especially as we are reminded by @treenutter this is a group buy thread.

But guys, underneath the urethane is the 3mm wall steel flux ring. It's not the motor yet. You can take off the urethane and the motor will still be protected by this steel flux ring, which is the same as the idea of using a "fully covered metal sleeve that is replaceable". 

It's even better than the V3 since the V3 only had a 1mm wall steel flux ring. So if you're really having issues with heat, and you didn't mind the V3 setup, then by all means rip out the urethane. This is DIY, so build as you prefer.

Made the base of the wheel adapter extend more, so now it's almost 50% urethane/50% aluminum for SpeedDrive R and 70/30 for XL. XL is a bigger motor and has lower kv so should handle heat better.

He's the one I'm referring to that's building the battery packs right now. He's concentrating on the 4WD atm since he already has 9 enclosures with him. The 4WD enclosure is different from the 2WD enclosure. The 4WD enclosure is from LHB and it's bigger.

He's also doing the 2WD, once we get the enclosures from Ebooted. We're just starting builds on what we have already.

We're really guilty in the communication department. The truth is, we actually get more sales when we communicate. That in itself sounds good, but if we have to pass along those sales money to vendors/suppliers that do not deliver or deliver with wrong specs, then we're screwed.

So we have been spending our time building the product itself, so we can be sure of timelines, specs, quality, iterations, etc. Case in point, coming up with this extended wheel adapter in such short notice is really a great benefit for us. Having our own CNC machines have made us control the production more. Soon we will be able to machine the hangers and other parts.

For those asking and to get back on topic about the thread, we are not selling drives-only anymore. We really prefer that we also control the configuration that our drives will go onto, so we're on complete boards from now on. There are some members that bought multiples, so they may be willing to sell their extras. Still need to deliver on XLs and we're working hard on it.

Now about the no-grip remote control.....:sweat_smile:

At the moment i'm building 4WD evos, i was commissioned one and it shipped, and was just commissioned for two more. I have not built an EXOs or rear wheel drive EVOs yet other than my initial prototype. Plans seem to constantly be in flux. 

A lot of people ask me where they all are. I build them as quickly as i receive parts and get paid for them. That's all i can really say about it, unfortunately.

You will get the longer and latest wheel adapters which comes out as around 50% urethane and 50% aluminum. The urethane is on the part which scrapes the ground if you go on and off driveways or speed bumps. The aluminum part hardly gets scraped. The new adapters just slides over the steel flux ring, and screwed on just like the wheel adapters you have now.

To build things quicker, I solicited @psychotiller's help to build EXO Pro battery and enclosure. Just made the order to buy 30Q cells for initial run.

I will concentrate on the drives and their assembly. With the CNC, I'm producing parts that would have taken me a month to wait for. So things are moving on.

Here's another manufacturing efficiency that we are doing. We are only going to machine wheel adapters for clone wheels and put heat shrinks on 3 of the prongs to make it fit ABEC 11 Flywheels.

![20180806_195138|690x388](upload://xZbQ1QD1vZElk4jhofIf1qLLEMM.jpg)

There's a couple of reasons this is better:

1. This will make us machine only one variation and allow us to have more time to machine other parts like the XL hangers, wheel adapters for Kegel cores, adapters for SixShooters, spacers, etc.

2. This actually solves the problem with the prongs of the wheel adapters cutting into the soft spokes of the ABEC11 Flywheels. The clone wheels are stronger and the they don't get cut easily, so no need for heat shrinks.

We've found out that no matter how smooth we machine the edge of the prongs, it will still chip away the soft plastic of the Flywheel spokes. The heat shrinks will act as a buffer separating the plastic spokes from the aluminum prongs. It's better to have the heat shrinks get cut and chipped, because you can replace them easily and cheaply, than the spokes of the Flywheels.

With 3 prongs covered in heat shrinks, it is already a tight but good fit. The other non-covered prongs will be in the middle of holes and will not touch the plastic spokes, so they cannot do any damage. This will effectively make it a 3-prongs wheel adapter, much like the Metroboard pulley insert.

![image|666x500](upload://8prKNC1ZsOAh7uQdt1yQDwRj69e.jpg)

Both TorqueDrive and SpeedDrive R/XL wheel adapters will be machined for clone wheels only from now on. We will send them with 6 pre-cut heat shrinks that you can install if you're going to use ABEC11 Flywheels.

Yup, proven to work! - except, being uncertain of the strength of the prongs, I put heatshrink on all of them. Makes for an aggressively snug fit. @LEVer is that overkill? 

Also used adhesive heatshrink, adds more thickness and prevents heatshrink from slipping out.

Yeah, your setup made me confident it works. As long as you can fit the ABEC 11 Flywheels, it's fine if you put heat shrinks on all of them. People can start with 3 prongs and work their way up. Main thing is to protect the thin and soft spokes of the ABEC 11 Flywheels since they are expensive.

Definitely use double-wall, adhesive lined heat shrink for thickness and for not slipping out.

Tape is too thin and will eventually come off because of the heat and less-conformed fitting. Buy this from HF if you have one close by and just use the 3/8 size, cut them longer than the prongs:

Jumping late in the conversation.
About over heating how do you recommend to remove the urethane without destroying it ? I'd like to keep it on the side if possible. The drive is unusable with urethane on a 2WD configuration, it will overheat with 5-10 mins ( I weight 83 kg ). 

I am trying to reach you by mail for 2 month now the V4 you sent me ( not my updated V3) has one motor with a huge gap. I tried the technique with the wheel and tightening the nut as hard as I could with no success, is it safe to ride ?

![2carvon|690x311](upload://ArHLDlvQQevAx5TLsKCKKsmiLAr.jpg)

So this is what the inside of the motor looks like.
The bearing in the middle is what the can gets screwed into and goes over the silver end of the stator.  The black plate on the right side is the part that slides over the hanger and connects everything to the hanger. It screws into the silver part of the stator with 3 screws and sandwiches the bearing between the stator and itself.


This is all based on the v4 that I have and I am not sure if the are all identical, but the bearing on mine is thicker than the silver mounting part that it slides over on the stator.

![carvon%20motor%20bearing|286x500](upload://ePHSIIkFNglHPaTa1iZk4iBseV5.jpg)

but in your photo it looks as if the silver part from the stator is poking out the end of the bearing.

You would be able to tell if you removed the 4 screws and took the can off.
But the can be hard to get back on because the magnets pull it to the side making it difficult to align.

You can completely remove the urethane and it will be like the one you previously had where there were no urethane covers on it at all. In fact, it will be even better since the steel flux ring that covers the motors are thicker at 3mm wall, the previous one only had 1mm wall thickness.Since you liked the previous version, you can go ahead and remove them.

If you have the wheels, bearings and spacers all installed and tighten by the axle nut, the rotor shouldn't push out like that unless there is a gap between the wheels and motors. The wheels will push them in and the spacers will allow you to crank the axle nut tight without squeezing the bearings.

I don't frequent this website. I almost never read PM's here and haven't for about a year. I have an email address and a phone number that I use and check daily. I don't have a 12mm Carvon axle so I made my own on the CNC lathe that is precisely 12mm in diameter and it slips into the reamed hole in the hanger nicely.

When someone emails me or picks up the phone, gets me an axle, and approves the hanger design, I'll make a production run.

The only time you replied to me is when your were called up here in the forum again. Then you tell me you have this condition. Okay, fine, but can't you hire someone to do the XL hangers. I hope you have more than just that one hanger by now. It's not like you have no resources because I hear that you just bought another company and is expanding your shop.

So when is this gonna happen Chris? I rented the space from you and you never even cleared your stuffs out of it. It got me too depressed that I stopped going there.

Is it possible to add a battery percentage indicator (maybe as an option)?
There is an usb connector ?(for the backers you told that we will have shredlights,so it will possible to connect with usb on the battery?)
Thanks

That's gives me an idea for a really nice way to build a nonflex pack.

25mm wide .20mm nickel for two-row series+parallel, fold over style. Leave a little excess to solder on the balance lead. Very even load sharing, very little dicking around.

Thanks @LEVer @psychotiller!

The remote has indicator for the battery fuel. No need for gauge on the enclosure.

There is no usb connector. The ShredLights have their own little battery and usb port that you charge to wall outlet, much like your phones.

Nope, never was. Always wanted to offer a non-vesc board with a solid-connecting remote. Just get-up and go, no messing around.

And now with the 30Q cells and higher discharge BMS, it actually has more startup torque and range. Did not record top speed but it's up there. Been riding it all afternoon yesterday and I'm impressed. It's definitely a CARVON now.

All good!

In the remote's datasheet it's told that led will be green between 100% and 40%,Red between 40% and 12,5% and blink Red when <12,5%.
It's ok but I think it's not too accurate / precise.

Reminder: I do NOT work for CarvOn

Although I understand people wanting a LCD indicator on the board and VESC...first,the IGG EXO was not at the price point of using dual VESCs. It was priced at modifying Koowheels. with the upgraded battery and having to essentially toss the KW batteries there is a loss of money.

[quote="Indiegogo_exo, post:1234, topic:36289"]

[/quote]

Secondly, you can probably add this in yourself? not 100% sure where the wire leads would need to go on the KW ESC though. Lets not make the delay longer by asking for more parts to arrive and having to dremel holes and solder two wires. The 30Q battery is already a great upgrade.

That LCD is more headache. The connector behind it easily falls off. Then your board will be out of commission with just a simple disconnection. We can hot glue the heck out of it, but it's really not necessary with the indicator on the remote. It's also hard to install it on a somewhat flexible enclosure.

It won't be practical if it keeps breaking down. Honestly, the EXO Pro is as practical as it can get, with the features of performance longboarding thrown into it. 

As a first board, you really would like to concentrate on the ride. Make sure it rides well...and rides well for a long time. If you've been riding for a long time, you can actually sense when you're battery is starting to drain, even without the gauges.

For all of you worried that the Exo is using koowheel parts. Let me assure you that the koowheel 2nd gen is underrated beyond belief. Unfortunately the reputation of the first gen carried over to the 2nd gen which is a shame. 

The ESC on this thing has Vesc level smoothness. Sure you can't customise it but the way it is configured out of the box is as smooth as you can get it. Rock solid connection to the remote and the motors are designed for 97mm hubs. If you want even more torque, drop down to 90mm abecs on the carvon torque drives or go upto 107mm if you want more top speed.

I weigh 75 kilos fully decked out and never met a hill i cant climb easily on 97mm hubs. The koowheel electronics are also dirt cheap. A new PCB can be had for around 100 euros and remotes go for around 40 and its a very nice remote at that. Has vibration, dual speed modes and frankly, i like the way it feels in the hand. super soft high quality fitness band feel to it.

Please Don't use your board when it rains, especially with Carvon's. The bearings will wear out really quick. 
And it's dangerous as hell, you lose almost all the grip on the road with urethane wheels. Acceleration and braking is sketchy AF.
Anyway I'll be glad to try your board if you come to the shredding session with OKP ! :slight_smile:

I would advise against deliberately riding in wet conditions on any board. Even if it's a something that should be covered by warranty, and especially if it's your only board, factoring in the downtime. It's also particularly hard on things like bearings.

We are confident about the sealing ability of the EXO Pro. The ESC and enclosure is surrounded by gaskets to prevent water from going in. The V4 TorqueDrive is also fully enclosed:

![20180814_154718|690x388](upload://jQsWYrYKcalabT89joULclJ6QeG.jpg)

But continued water-protection should be actively done by the rider. Gaskets can shrink, sealers can melt, wires can get damaged, bearings dry up, etc. So immediate cleaning/drying should be done right after riding on wet roads and a monthly maintenance should be followed. It's a lot of work for the rider. We also strongly discourage purposely riding on wet conditions as explained by other posters.

The charge port is same as it's on the ESC. You guys may want to get a faster one because it will come with original 1.5A charger. And since the pack is bigger, it takes even longer time to fully charge. We will source a 4A charger and offer it for an upgrade.

I have was having trouble with my V4 too, and have now got all the tools needed to pull them apart get get them back together.
I currently have one side of my V4 completely disassembled and waiting on a replacement part to get it all running right again.

So if you need any help on how to get everything taken apart to try and fix it, I might be able to help.
The biggest thing that will help with figuring out what is wrong is getting the can off to see inside and why its not sitting right.

Taking it off is easy, just get the 4 screws out and pull it off.  Getting it back on is the challenging part because the magnets pull the can off center when trying to get it mounted right.

Glad too see the hands on community involvement with stepping in to assist.

Will be keeping an eye on updates and look forward too seeing the XL's arriving to owners in hopefully the not too distant future :slightly_smiling_face:

Not sure there's a problem if it drives normally, but I'll send you a longer wheel-to-motor spacer. Also, I would highly recommend putting heat shrinks on the wheel adapters, doing this will help in pushing the rotor in. You may not even need the longer wheel-to-motor spacer.

Go easy on the heat when installing the heat shrinks and highly recommend to remove them from the motor so as not to heat up the bearing.

Alright mate, I hope it will help ! 
But I have to say that I decline all responsibility if the right motor breaks during a ride in the near future. 
I will go buy a 10 mm steel bar with 8 mm hole inside to dismantle the motor and see if there's a problem inside before riding it, never too cautious with these. After all they are speed  monsters.
I'll PM you once I have dismantled the drive and will tell you if I find anything suspicious.
Thanks

No need to dismantle it if you're just putting a longer spacer between the wheel and motor. 

The issue is the rotor sliding off from the inside bearing. Most of the time, this happens when someone revs the motor too fast without bracing the rotor. Centrifugal forces pushes/slides the rotor out if there is no bearings or spacers to keep it in place.

Once you put the wheels (which has the bearings and spacers inside it) and the wheel-to-motor spacer on to the axle and tighten it with the axle nut, then the rotor does not push/slide out because there is something preventing it from doing so.

On rare occasions, the wheel-to-motor spacer may be too short and not able to push everything towards the center, then a longer one will solve this. Another part that helps to push the rotor is the wheel itself via the wheel adapters. If you do not have heat shrinks on the teeth/prongs of the adapters, then there can be gaps which can also prevent from pushing everything towards the center of the truck.

I used the spacer you furnished with the drive so I think then it's what you said and it's too short. 
I will as well add heatshrink asap and test ride the drive ! 
What I don't get is why it happened to one motor and not the other since it's exactly in the same configurations. Tests will tell ! 
Thanks for all hope it will be resolved soon :slight_smile:

A little update.... XL hangers just need to be flipped to enable other sides to be machined. I'll ask @psychotiller about status on Wednesday when I go to his place to pick up more EXO Pro battery packs and enclosures.

Speaking of EXO Pro, we start shipping them to Indiegogo backers this week. Update posted on IGG.

The EXO Pro is also available on our website and ships between 1 - 2 business days after ordering. We are working on the EVO 2WD and will give an update on them very soon.

All will be shipped out very soon. We just started with the Indiegogo backers cause there is a lot of them compared to the pre-orders. We wanted to keep chipping away all the backlogs, especially the big ones.

There will be no more ABEC 11 adapters. The clone/generic wheel adapters will work, just like what @mutantbass did. Those are clone/generic wheel adapters. This procedure is better because the heat shrinks protect the thin and soft-ish spokes of the ABEC 11 Flywheels from the forces imparted by the aluminum teeth. We wanted the heat shrinks to be disposable, not the more expensive Flywheels.

EDIT:  We are making Kegel-core wheel adapters.

It will work, but you will not have strong brakes. The EXO Pro ESC is not configurable like the VESC. There's no way to make the braking stronger to compensate for the bigger diameter wheels.

All SD-R/XL wheel adapters will now have an extended base, including Kegel-core adapters for them.

TD Kegel-core adapters does not have extended bases, they look like what @mutantbass have in the picture, except that it has round teeth/prongs to go into the round holes of the core. So far, we do not have any heat issues with the TD.

You can choose clone/ABEC11 adapters or Kegel-core adapters. If you're already set on using ABEC 11 Flywheels, we can install the 3 heat shrinks on the teeth and include more heat shrinks in the package that you can install yourself in case they still fit loose.

Perfect thank you for the quick reply and update ..heavy props Jerry..I definitely will want some kegal cores adapters for my speed drives when they are ready for sale .. I'm not to fond of the abec 11..nice wheels but imposible to find anywhere in Canada.im stuck with clones that are way over priced by the time I  get them here 80 bucks..and they seem to be much rougher and mine are chipping already...and I'm all about the 85 to 90 size wheels as the 97 and 107 look way to big to me ..holy monster truck wheels ..the big wheels suit the drop down decks more..but for a deck with a kick tail they look to funny in my eyes reminds me of a king sized penny board..not cool ..and I'll buy both adapters for the TD when we get the group buy going ..
CHEERS Jerry

SDs have 70mm outside diameter. TD has 75mm OD


SDR = 90mm to 97mm wheels

SDXL = 97mm to 107mm wheels

TD = 97mm to 150mm wheels (must use VESC-based ESC for 100mm+ wheels)

I get a lot of questions about using pneumatics on Carvon V4. I have only used sixshooters on TD.   Really want to use sixshooters in SD and XL, there seems to be plenty of interest (read demand from people willing to pay) for adaptor that fits SD and XL.  Seems like only a few modifications to existing TD adaptor from @psychotiller, to the axle hole/lip and drip hole plates and then can use the same sixshooter adaptor that bolts into the wheel and pairs with the new adaptor plate?

Any ability to get this available?  I know there are a lot of other higher priorities but sa like only a few design modifications someone could make then CNC?

Well Well Well,

I got fed, drank a cup of coffee and had my evening cigarette. Time to make a post about these coveted torque drives :slight_smile:

**About me:**
********************************************************************************
- 75 kilos all geared up
- always prefer a soft, carvey and torquey ride vs straight top speed.  
- have 6 month regular long boarding experience before electrics so can push and foot brake at lowish speeds comfortably.
- i do not have to commute anywhere.This is just for me to cruise about on the beach enjoying the views and the sunsets.

**The setup:**
*******************************************************************************
- The carvon TD went on a regular koowheel gen 2 AKA kooboard. 
- My battery is the shitty 154whr 10s2p samsung 22p version because i can travel with 2 of them on planes legally.

**Decisions decisions**
******************************************************************************
I am truly blessed to have tried the raptor 1, raptor 2, meepo, evolve, verreal, diy kit etc etc

It basically came down this. I don't like belt drives. The noise and the drag just annoy me and I don't get the feeling of long boarding on belt drives.

Hub motors are awesome in terms of coasting, noise and stealth but if the roads are not perfect, you have to deal with a really harsh ride which takes the joy out of the whole thing. Sometimes, it can get so bad my knees would hurt and I am barely over 30. YUCK!!

I had heard of carvon direct drives years ago but availability was scarce so just never got round to it.

All this while, I was riding my koowheel thinking
![mass_effect_meme__thane_by_royal_tarts-d74f7vb|480x480](upload://lgNz8jRANDXxOxCOQmOJaDlPurB.jpg)

I finally gave in and decided that a softer real long board wheel ride was worth the noise and drag and finalised a belt drive setup about 3 weeks ago. 

Was ready to order all the parts but decided to go to carvons website just out of habit and lo and behold, there they were. 2 torque drives for sale ready to ship. The only other time I have gotten my credit card out this fast was when Qatar airways offered to bump me from economy to business for ¬£200 for a 2x 6 hour flight (was worth every penny). 

I am in Barcelona right now but ordered the drives to my UK address because I would have to deal with import taxes and didn't fancy doing that in spain not knowing the language. Sister took delivery of the drives and overnighted them to me here and that brings us to today.

Before we go further, let me say Jerry has been an absolute gentleman as he forgot to ship me the 9 pin connector to vesc connectors and sorted it out immediately. I won't be building these TDs with a Vesc for atleast another 6 weeks until I am back in the UK so its all good.

**Getting ready**
*************************************************************************

Spent half an hour this morning swapping the rears on my kooboard but it was 32 degrees Celsius in the afternoon so waited till the evening to go on the board although I was riding from the kitchen to the bedroom in the house with much amusement.

**Why 107s and not 97s**
***********************************************************************
This questions seems to have come up a lot so here are the main reasons
- I am pretty light at 75 kilos ~ 165 pounds
- I never felt like the koowheel has slow acceleration or braking so I was more than willing to sacrifice a little on both of those to get even bigger wheels and more thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane
- If I am gonna spend ¬£100+ on wheels anyways, I am going for the biggest baddest thane money can buy
- Backfire have just released their g2s which has hub sleeves of 83mm and 96mm on the same hub motor and they seem to do fine. Going from 83 to 96 is a bigger jump than 97 to 107
- If i didnt like the 107s, I can sell them and get the 97s. Abec 11s hold their value no problem

**Ride quality**
*************************************************************
Let me just start off by saying. There is no substitute for thane. My landyacthz dinghy with 63mm soft real wheels has a plushier ride that the harsh 97mm 85a hub motor ride. go figure


![F7260785-00F2-4105-8000-43F4AB0C1F45|666x500](upload://gNQHtHM935L8HrnvSLLl4NKrh1j.jpeg)

The ride quality is orders of magnitude better compared the 97mm hub motors. If the hub motors were a 4/10, this is a 9/10. I imagine the only thing better than this would be pnuemetics and a flexy deck.

You know the "thud" "thud" "thud" you get on riding pavements like this
 ![Capture4|690x414](upload://rB6f2RGKvQyrvgX7BwdrHQWFzFy.jpg)

ITS GONE!!!

What was unbearable before is more than doable now and what was just bearable before has suddenly turned into a smooth ride.

I could not believe the difference in ride quality and the coasting ability of direct drives makes it feel like the good old days of long boarding without needing to push. I was in absolute heaven and swear to god, I randomly screamed out 

"CARVOOOOONS, FUKKKK YEEEHHHH"

and 

"THAAAAANNEEE, I GOT MORE THAAANNNEE"

a few times on the beach today much to peoples amusement.

**Performance**
*********************************************************
Like I mentioned before, I never thought the koowheel was lacking performance. @longhairedboy is on record saying multiple times how hes impressed with the performance of the koowheel for its price point except the lack of thane :) Well, thats fixed now.

Let me show you the same hill from three angles so you get an idea of its incline
![Capture2|690x316](upload://wa2oSMP9pDcTxrMdXqtFSMafx3i.jpg)![Capture|690x383](upload://kfN8yrqUFmw5v0JXngzNs6b2AMs.jpg)![Capture3|690x395](upload://8cL8xatCbi5R6csY3lImXepIChP.PNG)  

@LEVer The TDs with 107s had zero problems taking me up the hill and braking me to snails pace downhill. Was there a slight decrease in acceleration and braking power? sure but I will take the extra 5mm of thane, thank you very much

The mid acceleration seems to have improved with the bigger wheels and the top speed would be higher too I imagine. 

**Thoughts on the carvon exo**
****************************************************************
Today's ride got me thinking about the carvon exo. I spend ¬£500 for my koowheel, another ¬£120 for a spare battery and around ¬£500 for the torque drives bringing a total well in excess of the exo price which includes a legit landyachtz deck and 10s3p samsung 30q batteries. Thats gotta be where the smart money goes. 

I know people snickered at the koowheel parts but I would chuckle inside whenever I heard people complain because I knew how good koowheel actually was. The ESC on this thing is as smooth as they come. Nothing abrupt and no dropped connections. I would buy one without hesitation if I didn't have to go through airport security regularly :frowning: 

**Closing remarks**
***********************************************************************
I try to not get too bogged down with specifications. I prefer iphones to androids if that makes any sense.
I get on this thing, its smooth as fuck and I feel like I am longboarding on a beautiful beach. Other than that, I don't really give a shit :slight_smile:
  
If you get a chance to grab one, you could do a lot worse that buying these. If you got any more questions, ask away. Hopefully this post was insightful.

Okay guys, more updates. I want to start by saying that all pending orders will be shipped as-ordered, unless you want to change to the latest and available version. This is being done to streamline production and get your orders shipped quickly.

1. **SpeedDrive XL will be discontinued**. We will be shipping the pending orders but after that, we will not build them anymore.

2. **We will sell the V4 TorqueDrive by itself, but not the V4 SpeedDrive**. All V4SD builds (which will be the Racing version only from now on) will go to complete boards only. We will have a Group Buy of the V4TD very soon.

3. **The EVO 2WD will now only have the 36" Evo Falcon deck and 90mm Kegel-core wheels**. There will be no more EVO 2WD with 39" Evo deck and no more EVO 2WD with SpeedDrive XL motors. We will ship the pending as-ordered and the old specs are still up on the website for reference.


By doing this, we hope to work and build faster. Thanks.

Hi all,

I‚Äôm new and been following the Carvon build for a while.  I‚Äôm thinking of dipping my toes any buying the 2WD board which will be my first e-board. @LEVer or anyone else who might have some solid information as there are a lot of threads here and other websites out there with mixed info... What is the current turn around time or what is the best time to place an order so that it could be shipped without waiting in a long queue to be built.  

I can wait and be patient while all the production kinks get ironed out.  I rather not put money down and get anxious and start asking the obvious question ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my board‚Äù like everyone else and add to the stress. 

I‚Äôm new to the scene for e-boards, forgive me if I don‚Äôt have all the obvious information.

Thanks!

If you've got experience bombing hills, then the EVO 2WD is for you. It's fast and doesn't do anything when you let go of the throttle, just keeps on going the same speed, kinda like downhill. This board is fast, maybe too fast for some. It also doesn't like to turn, it just wants to go straight...and fast.

The EXO Pro is a more practical board. It has better low-end torque and control. That's helpful when there's lots of traffic around you, think of stop-and-go. It also has reverse, EVO doesn't. The deck is designed for carving and a snowboard stance. If I'm going to use the board for commuting, I'll pick the EXO Pro. Exo Pro on the weekdays, EVO 2WD/4WD on the weekends.

EXO Pro is available right now and ships in 1 - 2 days of ordering. We are ramping up production.

@LEVer
hi, thanks for the quick reply.  Do you know when the Evo 2WD will be ramping up production to where it can ship 1-2 days of ordering like the EXO Pro is now?

You really summed things up well.  I think the Evo 2WD is for me.  I'm currently riding a Evo standard length non-electric long board so I'm familiar with its ride.  As long as there are breaks I'm good with the speed with the electric motor.

thanks so much LEVer

Are those for non backers as well? How long before the first 10 Kickstarter backers will receive their evo boards? My order # is in the 60's so I imagine I have ways to go?

VESC-based boards are more complicated to assemble. Even if we get the final design down, assembling them won't be fast. So it will take a while before we get a turn-around of 1 - 2 days for them.

LHB builds the EVO 2WD and 4WD....only. We build the EXO Pro so don't ask them about EXO Pros.

In fact, and this is for everyone, please don't ask them about any CARVON builds, just ask us. I got more time to answer now and will even have more to since we're crossing out the XL, so just ask me.

Around 15. Understandably, there were a lot who have backed out because of the delays. I haven't made the count, but for sure it's not that much left.

The SpeedDrive XL was offered before the final TorqueDrive came out. We we're not 100% sure about original TorqueDrive (Maytech), but people wanted something that has more torque than the SDR, so we offered the SDXL. It's a motor we're very familiar with. But the new and present TorqueDrive motor performs better than the XL in terms of torque, so the XL has to go. 

It's also a way for us to streamline production to be able to ship faster. It's not really a big market to be offering multiple product line ups.

Interesting. So, what are the benefits to the XL drive over the Torque drives? They are larger, no? I'm after torque over speed, and basically wanted the most torquey Carvons on earth, but your saying the Torque drives outperform them now? I'm confused by the very different wattage ratings between the XL and Torque drives, which are just modified Koowheel hubs, correct? Are the XL's still based on SK3's? I'm also concerned about longevity and replacement parts, so maybe the Torque drives are just Ann all afraid better choice?
```

The XL stands for eXtra Length. They 6374 motors while the R are 6364. But yes, the TorqueDrive has the most torque. They have the 24n28p configuration, same as Maytech, Raptor 2, Dexter's and Jacob's hubs.

Wattage does not reflect torque effectively. Most ebike motors have 250W and they carry heavier load. These high turn-count motors cannot be fed with too many amps, but they have the torque because they have more stator teeth and magnets. So if W = volts * amps, and the motors only take low amps, then that means they will have low Wattage. But it doesn't mean they have less torque.

Thanks for the insight, Jerry. So, is it really worth getting or even making the XL's or would it be better to just switch the XL's to the TD's, or even 4wd TD's for nearly the same price as the XL's? I wanted the XL's cause I thought they would significantly outperform the SD's and the TD's in torque, but now I'm wondering what benefit the XL's have for almost double the price of the TD's. Better cooling from larger motors? I live in a pretty flat town, so I'm not going to be bombing up long hills or anything, so maybe the TD's are a better option for me? I just want the torquiest Carvons I can get my hands on, and I'm not sure what the best option for my money is at this point.

I should revise the TorqueDrive rating. So we are using 36 volts on the EXO Pro with a 40A BMS. Theoretically, that's 36v * 20A which equals 720W. So the TD actually has 720W.

The torque is due to the increased number of stator teeth and magnets. Think of them as teeth in your wheel pulley. The more they are, the more torque you have. They don't show up in the equation.

The SDXL is the middle ground between the SDR (fastest) and TD (most torque). Consequently, we think that the market is not that big to continue offering it along with the other motors. We need to drop one, and we chose the SDXL cause if drop the SDR, someone will say they want to go faster, and if we drop the TD, someone will say they want more torque. They're actually a good compromise motor, we just don't want to be doing too much.

It really depends. Here's the thought process:

SDR = goes fast, up to 40mph. You guys have all seen @Michaelinvegas video. But least torque.

TD = most torque, can be equipped with SixShooters.  But should not be fed too much amps or else it will heat up, hence it's slowest.

SDXL = based on SDR but longer and has lower kv. Can get up to 32mph and has more torque than SDR, but not as much as TD.

So, it's a choice really depending on what you need. Now, if you want torque and speed, then 4WD SDR will be the best.

@LEVer I think that after me being confussed with stuff on your website there is a need for some explanation on true motor rating - SD R and SD XL are both rated 2.25 kW and 2.5kW each .... while the TD were 0.45kW and now you state that those are 0.7kW 

Personally I‚Äôm conffused, and I think others are as well...

Sorry about that. Things change when we test and push the components. As of right now, the TD motor can handle 42v (10s fully-charged) and 20A. That's 840W fully-charged. So that's close to double of the original rating. We got the original rating from the factory, which was using a 20A BMS (around 10A each motor).  But since we've amped up the BMS discharge and use the 30Qs, and tested it, we're confident in saying they are 720W nominal.

Hey Jerry.

Thats some great info. Does this mean that the koowheel ESC can handle 40A without modification? or are you guys modifying the ESC too?

Reason I ask is because I am planning to put two of the koowheel batteries in parallel giving me 10s4p and theoretically 40A output (20A per battery). What can I expect with 40A? more torque?

[quote="LEVer, post:1386, topic:36289"]
Wattage does not reflect torque effectively. Most ebike motors have 250W and they carry heavier load. These high turn-count motors cannot be fed with too many amps, but they have the torque because they have more stator teeth and magnets. So if W = volts * amps, and the motors only take low amps, then that means they will have low Wattage. But it doesn‚Äôt mean they have less torque.
[/quote]


However - more power you've got = for longer you can maintain the max torque of your motor. So, if you have extremely "torqy" e-machine but very little power, you will get clamped by max power at extremely low RPM.

Another argument for higher power motors is if you use thicker winding, the e-machine will have less resistance and therefore heat up slower, dissipate heat faster and overall be better for long use scenarios. Higher copper mass also allows one to have longer "momentary max power" rating which exceed maximum continuous current. 

[img]https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcdd5729b0b6f9c0fb4c05838304c0f7[/img]

So e-machine with lots of torque will give more power at minimal rpm, however it will peak out very fast and the it's just asthma-drive :) 

Anyway @LEVer, don't get this the wrong way - you at least come up clean on actual ratings of motor, design etc which for me is more important rather than buying supa dupa 12938457102983652345 gigawat garage motor.

That's why I posted on the TorqueDrive GB, you shouldn't use that motor with too much high amps/high rpm or else they will heat up. If one wants to maintain the top speed on TD, they need to increase diameter of wheels.

Thicker winding would be great, if there is enough space.

I don't know what you mean by "come up clean", I already told how much amps the motors can take, then you can calculate that with the voltage and come up the Watts. I'm not coming up with these numbers from air, I ride these motors too. Just this weekend, I've been riding/testing/observing/documenting/etc. them. You can ask the guys I rode with to get an independent opinion.

You guys are so anal about the motors when the motors are everywhere. Almost all configuration are out there. No need to re-invent them. Real innovation is on the trucks, the axle, the wheel adapters, the deck, the wheels, the interface, etc. There's no point in making "THE MOST POWERFUL MOTOR" when your trucks can't handle them. :roll_eyes:

But now it seems counter-productive since you guys are getting confused already. Best to keep IGG concerns on IGG and just check out our updates.

We already posted the latest update and gave you options, basically you will either get a board or a refund. Just have to wait for your number to be up.

[quote="LEVer, post:1433, topic:36289"]
Thicker winding would be great, if there is enough space.
[/quote]
An you managed to achieve that with SD + the fact that motors are outside of wheel, giving it more space + drive should (and 105% will) be smother because there is more urethane to drive on...

[quote="LEVer, post:1433, topic:36289"]
I don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äúcome up clean‚Äù, I already told how much amps the motors can take
[/quote]
I will give you that my wording here was bad - so hey sorry. However if you wrote how much current motor uses in some forum post, again I'm not indexing the whole internet to know that, I've asked because it was not on the motor marketing flyer ...

And ... I gave you a compliment, I even specifically stated to not take this the wrong way, and acknowledged that you give a lot of into, and acknowledged that your motor is better that some quack motors from china which claim 10kW... so please take a chill pill and don't throw the fit if somebody is actually on your side !

Cool ?

There was one for SDR and one for SDXL. The SDXL were not a thing when the SDR group buy happened. The people who bought SDR were given a chance to upgrade to SDXL when that gb went live but I'm sure that was the only gb for SDXLs there was.

Yes, these are the XL's. I'm not sure why they look different from @caustin's aside from obvious urethane sleeve. Maybe @lever can elaborate. I'll take more pictures and take some dimensions when I get home later, but they are overall much bigger than a regular 6374 can. Looks like some of it is extra urethane thickness and the machined adapter looks like kind of a cap that bolts to the outside of the drive. They are very impressive looking and quite heavy.

These are my speed drives R ..after the new wheel adapters @caustin was explaining. He is right they are the new abec clone adapters they help with heat and extra protection for the can it gives a bigger over all size.. i have no heat issues but I don't  have a blue tooth either I can touch them when ever the hanger now is the hottest part to the touch anyways..I'm getting Bluetooth soon ..they protect the cans when you cut the thane off..90 mm wheels are tight I'll prolly take it all off too for them or the new kegal adapter coming soon I hope ..I have 97 right now on my V4SDR..still different motors to SDXL but  @castin just has no thane or the bigger aluminum heat/protection wheel adapters on his motor..that is the only difference..

Thanks man. 

If you don't mind me asking. How much do you weight? How is the torque and braking effected going from 97/107 all the way to 150mm/6 inch wheels?

I am running 107s on mine and more than happy with the performance but 6 inch pneumatics might be even sweeter. I weigh 75 kilos fully loaded so curious If i can run the 6 shooters on 2wd setup. 

thanks.

I read your argument before. But having ridden both 10s and 12s setups and felt the motors after the ride, there is a difference. Actual reason unknown, so ghetto testing it is, plus I'll have a "extra" 12s pack since I'm gonna change to 10s on your deck to get more range.

Anyway, I forwarded your email address and note to Jerry. You will be the last person I will assist with the communication. 

Jerry has already been here commenting on delays. He was here because he literally had nothing to assemble since he was waiting for parts to come in. His silence might mean he‚Äôs back getting his hands dirty as parts flow in. 

The long awaited XL and EXO Pros are starting to get to people‚Äôs hands so I think I my ‚Äújob‚Äù is done. 

For those who are still waiting for something, maybe one of you can start and share a google form for people to put down their name/handle/product/order date  and order number and to mark it off as received. I would love to see the backlog

I totally feel for the backers, I'm sure Jerry is working his butt off to crank out those boards.  In my experience with Carvon, it seems to get order straight up is to pay full retail price.  I paid straight out for my Torque Drives early in the year when they came in stock on the site and had them within 2 weeks.  I was honestly disappointed to see Exo orders not being fulfilled for nearly half a year since then.  I was having such a positive experience with the drives and everyone who test drove my board with them really wanted some of their own.  You don't know how disheartening it is to tell them "these drives are really hard to get because I don't know where the owner has gone."   I truly believe that Carvon motors are an amazing product and worth the wait.  I just wanted to reassure folks that these boards are going out.   I'm not a backer, I'm a customer paying full retail price so it would be a bit unfair to place me in the same queue as everybody else.

Lucky you man, I placed my order on sept 14th last year, so that's a tough pill to swallow. Make sure you come back and tell us your thoughts on the board once you get to test it out. That might help with the wait :stuck_out_tongue:

Damn man, I really bad about that.  I already have an idea of this board is going to ride and believe me those motors are that good.  It's one of the reasons why I didn't hesitate to pay full retail price once I saw the new upgrades for Exo Pro(bigger battery, full sleeved motor cans).  I've put more than 300 miles on the torque drives and have only recently swapped them out with the XL drives.  Those torque drives can definitely take a beating especially in the rough NYC streets. Hang in there, those boards are coming.

Thanks for the response! I don't know if you can do that on Indiegogo. I thought that was one of the stipulations to backing a campaign. It may not work out. I got burned on something a couple years ago from a total startup and I haven't backed anything else since but carvon is a existing company, it seemed like I didn't have anything to worry about. At the end of the day I think pretty much all of us on that campaign still want our boards. We just want to know what's going on.

I‚Äôm assuming you are an EXO Pro backer?

Majority of the delay now is decks. Literally ran out of decks from what I was told. Drives are made. Batteries and enclosures are being made, it‚Äôs just decks now. Why did Jerry not order them in bulk? No idea. 

CarvOn has been selling drives for a while. I feel like this EXO and EVO thing is just him biting off more than he could chew. But at least he‚Äôs still chewing.

Carvon is not shipping anything since a year. I have ordered and paid for an EVO 2WD about 1.5 years ago. Although first emails were kindly answered by Jerry, he simply stopped answering after 6-7 month. I have now not received any answers to the last 7 emails. I am extremely disappointed and advise anyone to avoid it. Although it did not start as such, **it is now a scam!** Not to mention the 67 backers on Kickstarter who paid and never received anything either.

Scam has different meanings. Stary delivered a few boards to backers and scammed kind of 1000 guys. For those Who got a board maybe they are fine. For the rest they are scammers.
Imho they are not legit until they deliver 100% of the units. Stary has been selling boards to NEW customers while forgetting those who made it real. I see a point here.

I backed the REVO 4wd. $1700. there's a video about 200 comments back of someone who received theirs and love it. I don't believe it's a scam what I do believe is that it's unacceptable on any level 2 take a whole bunch of people's money for a project and stop communicating and responding to emails just because you're really busy. Or, you don't have a good answer to those emails. I also feel like you're beholden to these individuals who took a risk on you to deliver.  Biting off more than he can chew sounds like a pretty good bet but no communicating is BS. I really hope I get my board but I feel like somebody should know there's a whole lot of unhappy customers who spent thousands of dollars and have been ignored.

I agree with your feeling since you are new to this forum and have never seen any update, but those of us who have been here for a long time knows it's not a scam but a horrible customer service and the R&D cause failure that he needed to address and he had this mentality of "no news is good news" that definitely is not great from a business and customer standpoint.

It's a long read, but if you read up, you will see some comments on the delays. CarvOn is @LEVer on this forum. He was actively responding here like a month ago but have gone silent again once parts arrived.

I think this was the first post from him, click the little arrow UP and it'll take you to that date and you can scroll down and read what's happening:

EVOs are being made by Damon/LongHairedBoy. Last we heard, he was working on four of them. Not sure what the current status is though.

Not a scam, just a really disappointing way to do business. I have ordered all three types of motors now. When I ordered the exo motors back in like Feb or March they came within a week. I sent them back because I decided to buy a second xL motor which I eventually traded to go 4wd. The SD took several months but they finally came when everyone else started getting theirs. Ordered the XL back in November or early December and they are just now being sent out. I feel your pain man but it‚Äôs not a scam in the sense that you won‚Äôt ever receive your product. You should just get your money back through your card company and move on. Unfortunately this has become all to common in the Esk8 industry. Small beginning companies get preorders to get the startup funds  and then get too optimistic about delivery dates. Ending with this same kind of situation. I could name 10 companies right now that have had similar issues. I guess communication is the biggest issue with Carvon. The only company that never actually gave me a product was Marbel. Over 3 years and no board or communication. That‚Äôs a scam.

I was scammed by PLASTC card on Kickstarter a few years back. Lost $125, they obtained $9 MILLION USD from backers and investors, delivered nothing and had constant updates, then one day the update was that they are filing for bankruptcy and closing down....somehow 9 million dollars was not enough for R&D. You know the "CEO" went off on some island with the cash. Now THAT's a scam. 

CarvOn is just like a mad scientist that works in the lab and not talk to anyone or bathes for months. @LEVer

I waited for the Boasted 1st and 2nd gen, Raptor 2 and the Bajaboard but I never had this much doubt like I'm feeling now from all those boards combined. He can definitely learn a thing a thing or two from Jason at Enertion about being transparent to the their customers. Don't give me he's too busy building bs. Was he too busy accept our money?

Mine came with the same two tall board side bushings, but different roadside (both red). The transparent brown is indeed the Ronin 95a OEM. The front may be a Riptide KranK 87a or maybe a 94a venom SHR *edit* actually I think they probably are Ronin Horchata 98a. That front roadside cone looks like a Riptide APS 90a and the back looks like a KranK 96a.

I pre-purchased as I wanted to support a local Esk8 run business thinking he would take care of those who backed him since day 1. Well that did not happen.... He told us "of course I am going to deliver those pre orders first as you guys are my first customers of the board and I will take care of you." Not a great way to treat your most hardcore customers to favor IGG (afraid of mob mentality with them so gets them off his back) and people buying off his new site paying full price.

So I made a bunch of transparent stickers awhile back of the Carvon logo for a DIY project and they turned out pretty nice.  I've ordered alot more to give out so shoot me a PM with your name and address if you're interested in some free stickers.  Note I will send these stickers at my discretion, I don't have an unlimited amount to give out.  I want to give out these stickers to legit Carvon owners and fans.  Sending me a pic of your Carvon build will drastically increase your chances of getting some sweet stickers.  US folks only...I ain't made of money üòÖ

Probably it may not be delivered to the backer unless it gains benefit from the general sale.
In cloud funding, this is often the case.
If CARVON sells a lot, delivery to backer may be done at an early stage.
If you want to get delivered quickly, do not complain but advertise.üòÑ
Delivery will be accelerated as more money gathers.üòâ
If CARVON sells more from the website, cloud funding backer should welcome it.
I think @Lever is a sincere person.

You make  it sound there's no more money to build. Where did the backer's money go? Frankly it's not our problem.  If you can't deliver the goods, give us a refund simply as that. 18 months later and only four evo boards are produced? How many of the four are for backers? Are we suppose to celebrate when only one gets produced every three to four months ("Another one comes to life")?

[/quote]

Money went straight to Chinese factories that requires a payment of their minimum order requirement.

For those who would like to read up on Indigogo's terms:
https://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms#/legalobligations

Jerry did a horrible job at number 4. just horrible! yeah you @LEVer, Updating people on delays and progress shouldn't be an issue. it's almost 2019, that rectangular thing in your pocket has everything you need to give people just a bit of respect for handing over their money over a year ago.

4.) **Legal obligations of Campaign Owners**
--Make good faith efforts to fulfill the Perks associated with a Campaign in the timeframe that is communicated to Contributors.
--Immediately notify Contributors if there are obstacles or delays.
--Respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed to them by Contributors.
--Provide substantive and quality updates at least once a month to Contributors.
--If you have received the Contributions from your Campaign, issue refunds to Contributors if you cannot deliver Perks.


BUT then again you as a backer needs to understand that crowdfunding is a RISK. and there are no Guarantees

**5.) Backing a Campaign**
--Voluntary Contributions. All Contributions are made voluntarily and at the sole discretion and risk of the Contributor.
--No Guarantee. The date to deliver a Perk is an estimate by the Campaign Owner (not Indiegogo) and there is no guarantee that the Campaign Owner will fulfill and deliver the Perk by that date. Indiegogo does not guarantee that Contributions will be used as promised, that Campaign Owners will deliver Perks, or that the Campaign will achieve its goals. Indiegogo also does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties for or about the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign, Perk or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of User Content posted on the Services.
--Limited Refund. Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors only where the Campaign has not ended, the Contributor has not received a Perk (as confirmed by Indiegogo), and the Contribution has not been sent to the Campaign Owner (full terms of the Refund Policy apply). Indiegogo does not offer refunds outside of our Refund Policy. In any situation where refunds are not available under the Refund Policy, a Contributor should contact the Campaign Owner directly to request a refund.

Hi everyone. Just adding my weight to the same boat we're all in. I went in on the REVO back when that was a thing on Kickstarter. $1750. That's a lot of money for me. I had trust in the quality, which I still do, and that's the only thing keeping me from driving to SoCal to ask for my money back in person. That, and the fact that I'd burn half the moolah from the refund on gas. You could say that I've learned a thing or two about investing. I'm backer #83 so if I ever see that sweet EVO delivered, I may have to mod it for a wheelchair.

If your optimistic, lets just say it takes LHB two weeks to crank out just one evo, that comes out to 26 -27 boards a year. You are looking at 3 years from now. If your negative, your money is down the drain with mine.

Holy crap dude... that puts things into perspective. I WAS optimistic. I still am, honestly, but I was also optimistic about Malaysia flight 370. (My apologies to anyone affected.) Assuming LHB works on the EVO exclusively for three years is a big stretch. Perhaps Carvon could use some attention in the public relations and marketing sector (hah)... more sales = more hands to help. One to two person manufacturing is not sustainable, and it is technically not even manufacturing. It is individually replicating a functional finalized prototype. Onewheel comes to mind for success in prototype to manufacturing. But that's apples to oranges. 
The carvon product is amazing and deserves to be invested in, which is why we're all here. Unfortunately, most of us are not reaping the rewards of our investment. I mean, ARE there any rewards for our investment? @LEVer can you answer with a yes or a no? How committed are you to getting all of your BACKERS a finished product? You have made it clear that you are committed to the product itself.

And we have made it clear that we are committed to you, by the nature and frequency of our comments and questions, and by the forking over of our cash money. Even if you ignore us or don't respond to us, we still have a relationship. Just like my relationship with my mom when I left for college lol. At the end of the day, she just wanted to know that I'm not dead in a ditch. And every so often I would have the five minutes on the pooper and the courtesy to say hey, I am still alive and functioning. Thanks for your investment in me. Then she probably slept better at night.

Just sharing my two cents over here. I received my exo pro last week and I am still waiting on an evo 2wd XL. I was just as frustrated as you guys are and tbh I was close to giving up hope.

I don't find any issues with torque at all. It's actually really touchy.. it won't go from dead stop to easy but you push once and it will launch fairly hard. 5 kmh and on it a weapon ..the TD should be a lil more respectful in the city and for normal riding and i wouldn't think a 97 would give it a issue..as my SDR don't really ..but I am 150 pounds and only 5.6 I know this will play a factor ..nice whip @LEE

The connector for E-bike was a little troublesome. 
As a result of the review, it is compatible with ESC such as koowheel 2nd's ESC, wowgo 2s and Own board.
ESC of Wowgo 2s and Own board is easier to customize.
It is because it is a conventional motor cable and sensor cable.
Even selling EXO with cheap VESC may be interesting.
EXO can ride more fun with VESC.

I'm pretty sure y'all can stop asking at this point. @lever 's notification of these messages are there. If he chooses to ignore the forum at this time, it's his choice.

For my little knowledge of the process, I think 9 more boards have been sent out since the last time he mentioned he ran out of decks. and one more should be sent out today or tomorrow since I was the one delivered the battery/enclosure/deck to him yesterday. I also delivered some new CNCed hangers so maybe some XLs will be completed soon?

@Indiegogo_exo Nick, you obviously created this account just for the EXO issue you faced. CarvOn has your order and money. If you can continue to wait, then wait, if you can no longer stand this lack of communication, then proceed with the credit card charge back so you can search for another board. Your question will likely not be answered any time soon....you might get your board out of nowhere as many people seem to have. @DilatedPupils ? was at the Vegas event with one and seem to work wonderfully. These things are out there but those people don't seem to be very verbal about them.

Imo its pretty shit if he is going to market a "new" board when most "old" boards have been undelivered. Unless this is an alternate version of the exo since they ran out of decks. I will gladly accept this lol

To be clear, The "running out of decks" is not like the decks are not being produced, Jerry orders a small amount at a time I think so it's not like he orders 300 decks at a time. Don't ask me why he does it this way.

The pictures of the boards you post was from the LA CicLAvia even a month or so back, the TD on the left came off the production EXO and has a Psychotiller battery, the one of the left is Jerry's personal board.

That is one the biggest problems with CarvOn. Communication, it doesn't happen, so when boards are sent only the sender and recipients knows. Carvon doesn't see a point in updating backer...I've tried advising him to, so going off of IGG update is pointless. The 10 boards are the recent production, there were boards sent out before those 10. Batteries, enclosures are being made and will be installed on the decks once it arrives, Jerry then puts on the torque drive on (already made) and the board gets shipped out.

No it doesn‚Äôt. 

I run them with 12s6p now and no they do not take off faster than a raptor 2. They match the speed though. On 97mm I get to 57kph on a good day. 

Here is a youtube showing an evolve taking off quicker and no an evolve gt does not take off faster than a raptor 2 either.

Unless you believe an evolve gt takes of faster then a raptor 2, I can‚Äôt argue those smarts.

Clearly there are numbers on your vesc settings that arent right. The acceleration on the TD are way higher than what you are getting. Even on 10s i am able to out perform the evolve on gt mode from the start. The reason why we say it beats the raptor 2 in acceleration and top speed its because we raced on the enertion LA even past month. And we did beat it.

97mm x 3.14 x 85kv x 36V x 60min = 55.9km/h

Torque drive is very good. Good cost performance.
Although it may be defeated by torque to Raptor2, it can win at the highest speed.
I like EXO very much. The elongation in the high speed range is wonderful.
In FSESC 4.20 it may not be able to fully exploit the performance of torque drive.

I thought the total battery amps causing the motors to heat up not the motor max. I run the meepo hubs with 80 motor max and 20 battery max and they don't get exceptionally hot.
Maybe it's an assumption of mine but I thought it's this way.

*The numbers are for one motor.

I will use FOC.
Motor MAX 35A
Motor MIN -29A
Battery MAX 8.5A
battery Min -9A
300W to 330W when using watt limit.

It is a pretty modest setting.
If flat and No wind, achieve 45km/h with 330 W output.
The balance between the range and maximum speed is just right.
If FSESC4.20 is Motor min stronger than -30A, cutoff will occur during braking.
As far as I am using, -29A has not caused cutoff.
But at -29A it is a little weak braking power.
If use VESC for torque drive, FSESC 4.20 is not recommended much.

You must not be riding them very hard. I rode them meepo motors with the same settings on 10s and 12s and definitely get hot. 

The carvon torque drive just don‚Äôt want to take the juice any higher believe me I tried. They instantly stutter and I always go max throttle with take off when possible.

Torque drive is dull at low speed, sharp at high rotation.
Even if battery MAX is increased slightly it is dull at low rotation.
Considering the balance with the range, it is more efficient to throw away the low rotation and turn it with high rotation.
As you think, I think it is because it rotates a heavy full urethane wheel directly.

The other day, I got the opportunity to use Raptor2 and EXO.
Although there might be a difference in the setting of VESC, I felt that I could not win Raptor 2 in terms of acceleration power from low speed.
But EXO has fun to turn the motor and maintain high rotation.
Both are attractive.

Maybe the 4WD setup is the only bit of information I am missing.
I am still unsure of my purchase, the Motor design of the TD is somewhat similar to the Maytech hubs and I don't want to get in the same shit again!

The Torque Drives are koowheel hub motors from their last generation with just the lip of the motor shaved off which is the edge for the replaceble hubthane. 
Mounted on a custom truck and an adapter for skatewheels screwed on the front.

Unless death arrives, yes. He didn't create CarvOn to scam people, but to create a product. He pays to have a few boards made, ships them out and puts in another order, I think it's done this way maybe to not put all the eggs in one basket (like we did).

Guys I cannot friggin believe it. After hearing so many negative comments and reviews I still have faith in @LEVer and Carvon and that‚Äôs what made me go ahead and make the purchase. 

I ordered the ExoDrive on Thursday and today it‚Äôs shipped!! 

IN 4 DAYS INCLUDING 2 HOLIDAY. 

So excited and can not wait to set it up and review here.

The 4wd is the only speed drive setup that can support pneumatic wheels. I can‚Äôt say for the Trampa wheels, but the V4 speed drives require a special modification of the six shooter hub to mount. @psychotiller can do this at the time of the order. The old Carvon six shooter adapters don‚Äôt work as well with the V4 motors.

Alright so:

On this site, one has the ability to see when a user was here

@LEVer's can be seen here: 

![image|135x36](upload://7rtRskShcT0GKPO9UslOsLD0IBl.png) 

Since then he's been @ so many times that even if he's seen email notification of the @ mentions , it still has not made him come on the forums.  

For newcommers who will eventually come, here's how it is. 

@LEVer is not going  to be summoned by @ him with questions

@LEVer will only log back on when he feels like he has th ability to do so

@LEVer will continue to do so , and compaining about it, is not going to get it moved faster. 

Jerry has not taken your money and skiddadled , this is a common pattern with him. 

If you want your money back do a chargeback. If your an indigogo backer and unable to, tough titties, welcome to ESK8ing with inddiegogo. 

Not trying to be a dick here , but after the 2nd iteration of this people really need to learn.

I've tried emailing, messaging, and live chatting Carvons' team but I haven't gotten a response in months. Anyone have any suggestions? I ordered this thing 3 semesters ago for college commuting thinking that it would be perfect for getting around.

It's pretty crazy, right? If he's stopped working on things he took money for, perhaps for the long term survival of the company, the ideal thing to do is refund us until he's ready to work on them again, and put them up for sale at that time.

At the very minimum he owes the unwitting investors an explanation and timeline.

I'm pretty chill, and I want Jerry to succeed, and I want those motors. But it's hard for me to keep rationalizing to myself that it's okay.

Mike, Jerry has responded.

He said his focus was putting these drives on Ebay and Amazon, clear as day. So the people who funded the terrible business model this has become are on the bottom of the list. It's all very clear.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carvon-v4-exodrive-torquedrive-closed/65730/190?u=brenternet

He stated would be here more and active in December, that was obviously nonsense.

I think that allowing the group buy to happen on the forum while there as so many customers with back orders being utterly ignored was the height of favoritism on the forum. It was irresponsible and actions like that erode the foundation that this community was built on, trust and respect.

@LEVer does not respect his customers, if he did he would be here explaining his actions. He's left them high and dry and he hides behind the old boys club and good old days on endless sphere while giving paid customers the finger. 

Any other seller here would be banned, drawn and quartered. Instead of that we have @Michaelinvegas running group buys for him and people he meets up with for group rides defending him. When does it end gentlemen? I think it's enough now. You've embarrassed yourselves defending this crap.

Lest we forget, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, this situation makes @bimmer look like a saint.

I have my suspicions on the issue. His current goal is to sell the future EXO complete boards, completely made in China. Factories require money to get started so his (our) money is probably tied up there. If/when the EXO Board sells, THAT profit/money will fund the drives and boards owe to the people in this thread.

Again, this is all speculation. My EXO Pro money is just a loan at this point. I paid in cash(check) at the Torrance SCPD2 event. He has (or had) no intention to scam people, but his lack of communication has turned into a very scammer-esk behavior which is sad. I've gotten three speed drives from him, the EXO pro is the only things missing from him at this point.

I have a speed drive also. I love his work..amazing drives But when told a half dozen time your drives are coming this week it and never get a tracking sent and then try and find out if they are even sent or not is very frustrating. then
you see people buying them on his site and getting them days after isn't very nice either..I think he should just be fulfilling order properly in proper order.this is not practical business THIS would be a KEY START to a proper business AND STAYING IN TOUCH DOES WONDERS...this back and forth for year now and months in between with no communication is seriously ruining him slowly but surely..

Dreadful business practices, no excuses literally. I can tell a lot of very reasonable people who are still being reasonable parted with a significant amount of money and are left with no way out or communication of any kind. Kind of makes alextech look like really small fry.

That's being nice, truthful and not vendor bashing

What makes it even worse is every time he shows up here with angry excuses, he's got a bag of fuck-you in tow.

Seems like a good strategy to garner $$$ to start-up without actually fulfilling the people who started you off in the early days.

If anyone has a shot of getting their money back via the card issuer I'd go that route, but I'm seeing people from 2 years ago...incredible!

I was this close to buying in the group buy  but with his shady practices, id decided to wait. 

At this point he should be banned from the site. Its full on scam mode. Giving updates  once every few month and still not fulfilling orders is a scam period.  He comes here drums up hope then bounces again. Also the fact he came to drum uo more money by the group buy but not send out IGG OR Kickstarter is clear and simple.

I got in alot of shit that day for being on my phone it was one busy day on the job site and ran threw mud up to my knees so I could get in that list of 10. and I have been very reasonable with him..and now it total silence again and he is slinging those drives out I'm watching his site.. hopefully PayPal and my credit card will help me when I contact them on Monday because I'm done with the e mailing and trying to find him..this is so unprofessional. And I don't get how this guy is allowed on this form to sell when there is a lengthy history of it ..I didn't know about his scammy ways untill after the drive order when I decided to start reading his threads..wow..now I was nervous but still had good hopes as he kept in touch with me and these are china motors with his design so figured he could actually hold up to selling them intead of his other issues building the speeddrive and the poor ppl that swapped to the xl that are still waiting well into a year or more now. Never mind the Evo falcon board lol omg what a scam. Has any one got one..all I know is something should be done here because honestly this guy should not be allowed to sell here. there has been ppl thrown off for way less.. I think we should start a money poll .. see how much money Jerry ows out to ppl and what products so we can see what is going on .. ppl have to band together now .. he owes me two exodrive/torquedrive with shipping to Canada worth 399+399+60+60=920usd

I wouldn't call it a scam since he is really trying hard to ramp up production and fulfill his orders. But the way he treats his customers (investors) is really bad.

So NBD, walk away, dick in hand, while he continues to sell product and has 10s of thousands of dollars and very little product delivered after FUCKING YEARS and 0 communication.

Jed Boards is taking a while, but he FUCKING COMMUNICATES!

http:///2019/02/01/jed-boards-interview-what-are-they-doing-over-there/



I am a huge vendor advocate and have been for a while.  I have even defended Jerry on here.

But enough is enough.

I think you guys with ongoing issues should start a PM chain.

Then have this thread pointing new people that have the same "grievances" to said PM.


This forum isn't the place for a public air out of this, but I do have mixed feelings whether it should or shouldn't be.


And if anyone is wondering, I was an XL group buy backer, but wisely jumped ship long ago...


Just my thoughts as this is frustrating as shit and instills distrust in our entire community and the actual quality DIY vendors.

If we support this kind of behavior, we don't deserve any better.

Yes I agree with you.
But the Jedboard example I am not sure about it. In fall 2017 I was considering the Jedboard and was in chat with him promising boards will be delivered early 2018. Luckily I ditched that and had a look around here. Shortly after that a thread on Reddit happened where several people local to Singapore started speaking out that he did shady deals with people what looked to me much more of a scam then the Carvon delays. 
Not communicating is disrespectful, selling stuff through the site to have some cash flow while other people are waiting is BS, but as I see it, his intentions are still to deliver what people have paid for. 
Examples for good communication would be more like Enertion or Hummie.
Looking at the Exoboard site also shows progress like wheels with fancy names on them. Putting legal action against him or doing chain chargebacks will just make his business implode with no one getting anything.

Edit*
And that this shit is not happening again here, I would suggest a new rule, that every organizer of sales and group buys established here should have the obligation to update the progress weekly on the thread or via chain mail.

He takes your money, refunds some and builds some to keep money flowing all while screwimg most over. Every new sale pay for refund / exo drive of a previous sale.

He deserves a ban.dont let him come back, drum up hope, then dissapear again.

He self-banned around the time he was gearing up for kickstarter, and came back when we begged him. So I really don't think it'll affect his mood or send any kind of message.

For buyers, it as significantly worse when he was self-banned, with information about setups and function only trickling in through side channels. Not that it's great right now...

I still can't believe people haven't received their XL's, of all things. I thought there were only like 20 of them from the group buy at the end of 2017. I got mine a few months ago and assumed they were all going out around that same time. I feel for you guys and could easily still be waiting (kind of surprised I'm not). I really like Carvon products, but the way Jerry is running things is baffling and shameful. I just seriously don't understand why he continues to make things so much more difficult than they need to be and ruin his own previously great reputation.

The status of his business license is unsettling. I know it can be suspended for various reasons, and it would appear he is still taking orders. If the business goes under, it will be much harder for us to get our money back. Likewise I hope nobody else has a drive that ends up needing repair.....

I'm on the same boat. I have a new Speed Drive on the shelf not being used, I've built and tinkered with three boards and replacing motors is relatively simple not sure what I'd do if a SD broke which is why I'm not building with it

Yeah I feel you man. Since I bought these beautiful six shooters from @psychotiller, I drove down to see him, and he was nice enough to try to compensate for the wheel wobble by adjusting the screws where it mounts on. It‚Äôs better but it at high speeds it‚Äôs still significant. Not to mention the compensation wouldn‚Äôt work at all for any other type of wheel such as abec. I don‚Äôt ride it at all because I don‚Äôt want the court to ask why I was riding around on motors that were broken (and I don‚Äôt want to eat shit). He seemed like a decent guy the few times I met him, but I‚Äôm stating to feel like it was just to have me trust him and get me off his porch. If he just answered my texts asking  ,give me a little bit of time to exchange (or repair) my speed drives since he‚Äôs backed up, I would have been completely understanding. Last time I left his place of business, he basically said he had no other ideas on how to fix the wobble, so obviously I need a replacement on these essentially unused drives. It‚Äôs severe, especially before tiller helped with it a bit. 

And of course I want Carvon to refund me for @sandervandenhurk so I can pay him back through PayPal. Since he paid me for the place in line for the order, and I‚Äôm the one who paid Carvon, I am responsible for retrieving the refund from Carvon. Even though I may be able to get help getting my drives repaired by another member of the forum, Sander never received an order at all, and I placed that order for him in December of 2017. He doesn‚Äôt even want the drives at this point. Even if they were being sent out tomorrow, he‚Äôs understandably concerned about getting any needed repairs when Carvon isn‚Äôt willing to help. We aren‚Äôt rich people. Sander is younger and just had a kid. I‚Äôm seriously willing to fly down to the Pasadena, California Small Claims court just to help him get his money back. I‚Äôm in the area often enough so I‚Äôm not giving up. 

It should never have to come to this simply to get a refund for a missing drive and a replaced/repaired broken drive. The claim has been filed, I just don‚Äôt know how long it would take for them to set a date.

I‚Äôm a very understanding person, but in this scenario, the less you complain the further back you get pushed back in the order list. 

Regular contact could have helped Jerry avoid all of this, but this is just step one. If this isn‚Äôt successful I will get legal help from a relative that luckily is a lawyer. They just reccomend this as a first step.

Battle harden is not that difficult.

I prefer to stay out of these kind of things but I thought I should say the following as I don't believe anybody has in a while. 

I waited a long time for my carvon gear but I ended up getting what I wanted in the end. So, as someone with no stakes in the company outside of my drives, I would recommend that you think long and hard before you go to lawyers with pitchforks and charge backs as this might cause more damage than help. 

I'm sure that there are a lot of you out there waiting for boards and drives respectively. If you all go asking for charge backs and legal action I'm sure that only so many can actually be paid out. Then you have to ask "what about the others?".

I do stress that I am not saying don't do it. Just make sure that you clearly understand the repercussions of the actions prior to taking them.

The problem is that even if you have your purchase.....your unlikely to get service if it isn‚Äôt working correctly.

I felt just like you a month ago. He was talking with me by phone, and I even went by his shop/home to show him the issue. Once he knew I had left town he started ignoring me all together. When I found out he hadn‚Äôt sent out the XL order we transferred to @sandervandenhurk I asked him in text if he would please contact him. I have screenshots of several texts saying yes I‚Äôll contact him right away......

Long story short, getting the product in hand might not be the end of it.

Small claims accepted the case. I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs just not going to show up because it‚Äôs pretty open and shut.

Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had to seek legal assistance in the esk8 market. IMO these companies don‚Äôt start up with bad intentions. I think that with no business experience they soon find themselves over their head. Rather than pay back the customers, the money gets used to try to save their sinking business. Eventually he‚Äôs going to cut his losses and leave with whatever he can. His actions are a huge obvious red flag.

I believe the MBS wheels are clone cores. What do you mean by the adapters not fitting? Are they too loose and the wheel wiggles around on the axle? Or is it just really tight when you try to get them on? 
The clone adapters that came with my XL‚Äôs were too loose on genuine abec‚Äôs. When I got proper adapters, however, it took a lot of force to get the wheel all the way on the adapter. 
So if it‚Äôs too tight then it could be you just need to push harder, or it‚Äôs possible jerry started sending out xl‚Äôs with Abec core adapters which I doubt, but who the hell knows what he‚Äôs up to.

If you got one of the last motors I believe they came with abec 11 adapters. He did that because @PXSS made ones that he should have in the first place and I think finally felt forced to do the same.

Good luck man. I ordered right at the same time. I‚Äôve texted and emailed Jerry hundreds of times. I have a pending small case claim against him. It‚Äôs already been approved and is awaiting a date. 

But that‚Äôs only an option for me because I live in California.

I would call the bank first. Depending on which one, they may still allow a chargeback.

Unfortunately for me, I don‚Äôt even have that bank anymore.

It‚Äôs sad too because for the longest time I was trying to defend the guy. I‚Äôve met him several times and he seemed to be trying his best. But after he knew I was no longer in the area, his attitude changed. In fact the only reason he ever started communicating with me by phone is because I went to his house a few times.

Good luck guys......I know there‚Äôs a few people that got their drives, and are happy to stay it if this discussion. I was one of them....just hope you don‚Äôt need repairs

The biggest issue here is that despite Jerry's horrible lack of communication, he was a great maker and seller of his previous drives which is why many of us trusted the group buy.

Yeah I have a 4wd SD setup. I haven‚Äôt even been able to use it because it has bad wheel wobble. I took it to Jerry twice and it was just given back the same. After that he just started to ignore me. 

If it was just that, I‚Äôd probably just find someone to do the repair. Im having to go to court because I did an XL order transfer several months ago to @sandervandenhurk. After many months decided he doesn‚Äôt want to wait years for drives that won‚Äôt be fixed if needed (because Jerry completely ignores him). Since I paid Jerry for the  drives, Sander paid me through PayPal. This means he has no means of a chargeback.

I feel obligated to help Sander. He trusted me during the order transfer process and he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be screwed. He‚Äôs a young guy with a new kid and these drives weren‚Äôt cheap. I I ever get any money for the XL drives it will go straight to him.

evolves keep the lights on, custom builds keep the parts flowing in so i can stockpile them. 

it sucks but i think individually everyone needs to decide for themselves if they've waited too long and what to do about it. Some have called thier bank. Some have waited. Some have asked me to just build one out of his parts and pay me for it. 

We have not "officially" cut ties with carvon, but we're not expecting to deal with them anymore either. Its kind of fucked up because we're basically having to treat it like carvon  just died and left their stuff at our house. I have piles of leftovers from when the directions changed so many times and nothing I need to build the last board I owe him.

to be clear, i am not building carvons out from under Jerry. Until i know that its game over for them, I won't be offering anything on a landyachtz evo, and i won't be selling his parts or using them in builds. 

however, if somebody says they're tired of waiting and wants one of mine instead, i'll take $200 off the list price.

I will help Carvon's customers as best as i can on the boards that i built. @psychotiller built the remainder of them so i have no idea what he's planning, but if you got a 4WD Evo built by me and it has peroblems down the road, i'll do what i can. 

That means i probably won't be able to help you if the motors take a shit or the deck gets destroyed, but if there's an issue with wiring or fried VESCs or some sort of battery problem i can probably help you. I can at least get you pointed in the right direction. 

I forsee a lot of Carvon Evos with alternate direct drives and some even going to belts.

Mine are essentially unused. There is a bad can wobble. You can see the can dip down and then up when it‚Äôs rolling.

@psychotiller was nice enough to let me come over and have him take a look. He was able to compensate for the wobble a bit at the six shooter connections but it still needs repair.

Yes the word on evo campaign is a scam, disaster, tragedy a damn shame. There is a reason he is not answering or update. There is no evo boards for you guys. Don't be fooled just because he sells a few parts, or put out a couple of evo boards because somebody with deep pockets can afford $3k+. Why do you think he raised the price from $3000 to $3500. It's already a lost for him to build it the campaign $1700. He probably used that to built a few parts here and there. 

As far as i'm concern his reputation is ruined. Who would buy something from him not knowing you ever going to receive the goods. The sad part is he dragging other creditable builders down with him LHB. He will never reach the success like Enertion or Boosted. Stay far away from Carvon.  Warn others to do the same. I suggest report or dispute charge made on your credit card for merchandise not received. It's worth a shot. Seriously if you had $3500 go buy a Bajaboard.

I'm a deep pocket dumbass who spent $3K on a Carvon and never got it either. None of my emails were ever answered. I eventually filed a fraud complaint with PayPal. They sent 4-5 emails and none were answered and I got my money back. Now to your other point: Is LHB credible? No. Not if you deal with thieves. Don't buy Carvon or anyone who works with them cause they know he's ripping people off but they're still getting something out of it so they look the other way. Complicit. And did I learn something and not spend $3K on something frivolous or give it to charity like a normal human..no.. bought a Bajaboard and it's awesome!

Please let update us on what his excuse is. Really wondering how CarvOn went from a good brand to this crap. 
[quote="Miguel1, post:2034, topic:36289"]
Is LHB credible? No
[/quote]

Wow, just WOW! You are slightly forgiven since you are relatively new to this circle. For those who don't know, CarvOn's direct drives have been around for a long time which is why the non shipping products are V4s (V1, V2, V2.5 & V3's has been fulfilled). In the past, Jerry has been pumping out drives and having mostly happy customers who usually got support if they asked. I see Jerry in person at group rides here and there as we are roughly 40 miles apart which is how I got to know him. He responded to me in a more timely manner than most of the people here which is why I offered to help with certain correspondence, but at the end of the day, this is all talk if he didn't actually ship out the product. LHB (Damon) and PSYCHOTILLER (Dave) were commissioned to build the EVO and EXO Pros respectively. They are paid by Jerry for one or a few builds at a time, but most of the parts needed are purchased and shipped to them by Jerry. If Jerry doesn't do his part, Damon and Dave has nothing to work with, thus you cannot blame anyone other than Jerry/CarvOn. LHB and PSYCHOTILLER are very stand up men who take pride in the business they built in this industry unlike CarvON that decided to do this.

I can confirm this. @Mikenopolis attempted to help me get in touch with Jerry when I first started trying.

How did I finally get a response with his phone number? Because in the subject line of the emails I put in all caps ‚ÄúComing to your office to get answers ‚Äú. He doesn‚Äôt want to have to see you in person which is why he responded to @Mikenopolis and myself because we live close enough to North Hollywood to show up...which I did several times.

I have met @psychotiller personally on several occasions and even discussed the carvon issue. He‚Äôs a good and honest person. Getting customers their products at reasonable times does weigh on him.....unlike Jerry. When getting involved with Jerry, he had no idea Jerry would develop into such dick cheese.  

So as a disappointed customer of Carvon, I still don‚Äôt blame those who initially worked with him. We all made the mistake of trusting the bastard.

Hi Mike - I see your point. Let me try and clarify it this way: You know LHB as a person. My comment was more about LHB as a business entity. A business's reputation will be affected by the partners and vendors they work with. So Damon is probably a stand up guy, but LHB made a bad business decision by working with Carvon. My intention was not to disrespect Damon. Apologies on my part if I made a personal attack.

Is basically what you just did lol

Lhb, or damon whoever you want to refer to them as - as far as I know-has done their part for Jerry, with the parts that weren't sent over with instructions to be built

I also understand that Damon has alot of these parts left over, but unless they're v3 or previous, I'm not interested. Everyone raves over these koowheel drives and I can't imagine why ü§∑ and if they are v3, unless that's the one you ordered, would you even want it?

I'm confused as to why these guys think Damon/Dave and their business' made bad decisions. As far as anyone here can see they got sent parts, then got paid to build X amount of boards, then they built X amount of boards. Nobody should assume that they have a millions hours of free time and are to build boards for free. Both have their own customers and builds to do on top of what Jerry had arranged. 

I had a 2WD order that I managed to switch out for two sets of drives before the Jerry went completely dark. Let's hope they last forever..

Maybe you have a shadow link to Carvon and know more about where the money went than you are letting on.

Only speculation.

Finally got some money back from paypal.  Disappointed that we never heard from @Michaelinvegas during this whole ordeal.  Also the title of this post should be changed  to "Official Carvon v4 Group Buy (Not Completed) most orders never shipped" .  That is an accurate title, to say that it was "Completed" is a lie/misleading.  I wish @moderators would edit this, so that if someone new, scrolls through posts on this site regarding carvon, they would at least see that something went terribly wrong with this group buy at a glance.

shadow link to Carvon
[/quote]

My link to Carvon/Jerry is that I was a customer of his V2.5, V3 and V4 SD drives and a EXO Pro complete board. I went to demo rides and group rides where he planned or attended. I knew his number and address. I've been to his shop and saw the shelves and floor of drives in the making.

He's not on the internet much so I would text him about group rides and CicLAvia events (close to his house) and we would meet up, ride and chat about his business. I also know the guys that helped him in various aspect of Carvon so I have a lot of those "Don't tell anyone" blurbs about his plans.

But in all honesty, Jerry is the only one who knows where the money is or was spent on. Last I heard (December?), it was a % deposit to a factory in China that was going to produce the Meepo/Wowgo looking board with Carvon TD drives.

@mmaner @anorak234 - What do you guys think? Should this be changed to "Carvon Discussion" or something along those line? It's pretty apparent now that Jerry/Carvon is not a business we can trust. Despite the no vendor bashing rule, many paid customers are just speaking the truth.

Lofty aren't the manufacturer gents. 

Regardless, Jerry didn't have money laying around to invest in some new venture, if he had he would have spent it scraping together bits to save his current business because his ego clearly required the acknowledgement of success.

He plundered the money on poor decisions and worthless R&D and in the end all he did was move some stock motors up the truck and shove some wheel adapters on the end of them - revolutionary! People here talk about it like it was a defining moment in esk8 history. 

Now some real business minded, talented people can pick up the torch and actually get some drives out to people who pay for them.

:roll_eyes: My Elofty comment was supposed to be a conspiracy theory kind of joke.

The worthless R&D where money was lost is definitely from the EXO boards using Koowheel parts, his decision to throw away their batteries and went with the Landyacht decks, Psychotiller's enclosure and batteries meant he either lost money or made zero profit per board.

It's the whole no vendor bashing rule. Special snowflake rules and laws screws with society as well as this forum. Moderators can make it what they want, but if this had a bashing type title, it might get locked down.

From what I heard from @Chase Jerry can't be served if he can't be physically found? Is that correct?

I agree with the vendor bashing but I think of that more along the lines of "XYZ vendor shipped me the wrong items or took too long to ship or is slow to respond to emails" blah, blah, blah. 

Carvon has stole thousands of dollars and isn't responding at all. That's an entirely different category and deserves to be labeled as such.

He left the shop a year ago and I think was working out of his garage at home. He was once right next to Abec11's shop in Huntington Beach, then moved closer to his house, then decided to end that lease because the other shops next to him cuts counter-tops so it's always noisy and dusty which isn't great for motors.

Someone that drives by his house to and from work daily told me he hasn't seen Jerry or his wife's car in front of their house for the past month or so

Hi @Chase. I have $1750 out of my bank because of this scam. I live in the Bay Area. I would be willing to drive to SoCal to attend court meetings, help with testimony, even help pay legal fees. I feel terrible being treated this way by a person. I hate being taken advantage of. It's not fair to any of us. And as the saying goes, justice does not exist in the world unless we create it. Message me if you would like help. If you prefer to persue your case alone, that's okay too, but I would seriously appreciate updates. I'm not sure that I'm ready to take legal action myself as an individual (I have no experience with the court system, I'm 25 and I'm busy with a job that's important to me) so I'm very happy that someone else has taken legal action, and I'm very willing to support you in it. 
@Mikenopolis, thank you for your consistent updates and insights.

Sometimes. Late at night when I can't sleep because I am having nightmares about warfare and death, I think about Jerry.

I think about what might happen if I randomly saw him at a bar.  

I feel my blood boil and my heart race.  I can feel the warm red elixir dripping down my finger tips after a good bout.

Then I smoke a bowl and am not thinking about actual fucked up shit anymore, just that Jerry is a dick and it really isn't a big deal, even though it kind of is because of the scale.


Thanks Jerry for the PTSD therapy. It really means a lot. Only cost like $700 for a fairly regular distraction from other worse thoughts.

Seeing that this üí© storm is where‚Äôs its at now i guess I can divulge this. At some point Jerry mentioned that he was going to exit out to the esk8 business because scooters is where the money is. I think he was going to put direct drives in the rear and since scooter in the front. Idea is that the front can be converted to take skate trucks so it can be turned into an esk8. But still not sure how far he went with that idea.

Ok. So I‚Äôve been extremely busy finishing my masters thesis and publishing a paper, at the same time as teaching 5 classes. I completely dropped the ball and missed the court date. I hadn‚Äôt served him yet, so it would have acted as a reset request. Had I mailed them 10 days in advance I could have avoided the whole thing. So my original case, and court fees are gone. I am calling the court tomorrow to see what the rules are for me opening another case with a different dollar amount and additional plaintiffs. Hopefully since I never served him they won‚Äôt have a problem with paying again, and getting it going again.

It looks like the maximum we could sue him for in small claims is $10,000. Double check this. Past that amount we would go to a different court and have to involve pricey lawyers. 

So who wants in? The courthouse we have to go to is in Pasadena California. It‚Äôs near Los Angeles. 

I‚Äôm claiming $1350 leaving $8650. Keep in mind that even if we do all this, he‚Äôs likely not going to be found to be served. If he is served, he probably won‚Äôt show up to court. However, if he does, it will be an open and shut case.

Some people get into business for the wrong reasons. They put their profit margins higher than that of what needs to go back into the business. If you're business makes lots of profit from one sale why take more than half for yourself. If you want to keep producing a better product use the majority of your profit back in. Keeps you more humble and responsible when your business has more in the bank than yourself.

Dude don‚Äôt even get me started about Marbel. They are even worse in my opinion. They actually conned me into sending the broken (never worked) deck back for a free upgrade to the newer version. 

Whatever the case, Jerry is was a part of the community and we trusted him. We met him, we rode with him, and when he said he would eventually deliver most of us believed it. That‚Äôs what makes the Carvon betrayal sting so bad.

Ok so I just got off the phone with the court. I am going to refile with multiple plaintiffs. Once the date is scheduled, we will hire a process server. The case costs about $40 and the server can be up to $100 (but probably less). Anyone joining in would split this (probably like $30 a person max).

This post is to see who wants to join. Keep in mind

You will have to show up in court in Pasadena, California. So it‚Äôs really only reasonable for CA residents.

Most importantly, this doesn‚Äôt guarantee any of us will receive any compensation. I‚Äôve been talking with the court. If we are able to serve him, we will win the case no problem. It will be open and shut regardless if he shows up or not. The court will then issue a judgment against him in the amount claimed. I‚Äôve been reading about what the court could potentially do such as wage garnishment, property leans, etc. You can read all about what happens if he refuses to pay in this link 
https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-do-i-collect-on-a-small-claims-judgment-398830

Ultimately if we don‚Äôt receive any compensation, we at least took a stand for what‚Äôs right and didn‚Äôt bend over and take it up the ass. It will destroy his credit and hopefully any future chances of growing a business. 

I‚Äôm claiming $1350
This leaves $8650 ($10k is the max for small claims) for anyone who wants to join. Once I know who‚Äôs in, I‚Äôll file the new case and we can serve the bastard.

Hi I bin trying to get of hold of jerry no luck I left the scene a while ago , anyways As a person who worked for Jerry for a while , I can say a few things. One Jerry has no credit he filed for bankruptcy a while ago 4-5 years ago. He was honestly the reason I left, I knew a lot of things of other company‚Äôs that I shouldn‚Äôt have known. I saw carvon going south but stuck  along for the fact that my whole purpose that I wanted to work for carvon, was not self interest or anything to do with my was to help the community and get the drives out. The first month I volunteered my Saturday‚Äôs and Sunday‚Äôs to help with drives 8 hours every Saturday-sun before he offered me a job. My believe from what I can tell ( I may be completely wrong ) is that Jerry invested his money and had no money to continue, he never had a finished product when Kickstarter came out always trying to improve it resulting in no money. So he started selling on his website for individuals to buy and he get more money to continue. That‚Äôs why people who bought from his website  have different carvons in like a weeks different , no urathane , half urathane , full urathane , Bigger motor cans , smaller motor cans , different fan designs. All with different batches on a weeks difference. In conclusion I don‚Äôt know what happened and am disappointed. 
This is all I can remember the motors were there the axles were there everything was there so I don‚Äôt know what happened

What can we do as a community to make our fellow riders whole if this doesn't pan out? 

I have reached out to Jerry several times to offer him help but no response. I feel for the guy since I too had trouble scaling up production but luckily I did not spend any capital on outsourced production and was able to refund customers that did not want to wait for an indefinite time line.

Im sure that if Jerry would come back and humble himself we could band together and rectify the situation using what he has left in parts. 

@Wallgreeens I will keep trying to get in contact with him in an attempt to get your drives if nothing else ü§û

I really hope Chaka gets through in some way or form. Even better if he ended up making some high end direct drive motors at a similar level to hummies as it seems that other vendors are struggling to meet those expectations. 

I spent a long time chatting to Jerry - almost annoying him with kindness and late afternoon messages/chats to get my gear out of him and even then what I got wasn't what I had ordered. It just sucks seeing someone put so much time and others put so much money into something like this and end up with a court case and some grumpy faces rather than sick motors/boards and smiles :frowning: 

Good on yah @chaka for trying. If anything I hope it instills some faith back into the community :slight_smile:

I‚Äôm another victim of Jerry‚Äôs business venture.  Inspired by his Kickstarter campaign, I put up $1199 for EVO 2WD preorder in February 2017.  Foolish in retrospect, as I could find so little information about the guy.  But Jerry appeared to have such an excellent reputation amongst this community of ESkaters.  Because I‚Äôm a preorder, couldn‚Äôt comment to the KS site.  Strung along by enthusiastic postings on this forum, some infrequent email replies from Jerry as well as some video reviews....I waited far too long, and now appears to be a complete loss.  $1200 is a Huge loss for me, but the lost time waiting and crushed hopes and dreams, was even a greater loss in a way.  I‚Äôve been a skateboarder here in Maryland (DC area) since about 1977...a vert skater, long boarder, downhiller.  I still have roadrash scars on my hips, and in a similar way, will be a skateboarder forever.  So this emerging Eskate technology is a perfect way for me to get back on the board and do some cruising in my older age.  At the time, in 2017, I was researching Eskate heavily and concluded that an entrepreneur like Jerry could do a much better job than I could.  SO here I am, over 2-1/2 years later having lost my entire budget and nothing to show for it.  Nothing.  Nobody in my generation is into this, so I‚Äôve never even ridden an electric longboard - only dreamed about it...ALOT.  I‚Äôm EXTREMELY angry but have no recourse that I know of.  A lot of you have lost far more than I have.  I‚Äôd also be interested to know who else has been burned.  Would it be possible to start a forum or site entitled, something like, ‚ÄúVictims of CARVON, (aka) LEVer, (aka) Jerry Palacio...etc.‚Äù ??   I don‚Äôt want to see this Jerry move on to some other venture (such as E-Scooters) and burn a whole new generation of enthusiasts.

PS: Now I‚Äôm looking at torqueboards direct drive, maybe diy‚Äôs 12S4P, Landy 40‚Äù falcon, Focbox...would be grateful for any advice.

Thanks guys.....Dave

That sounds like a good plan to rival any Carvon builds Jerry would have made. 

Since the FocBox is discontinued perhaps a Unity (if you can wait and want to play the pre-order game again) or the more apt to deliver Flipsky vescs.

Hey, I'm glad I can contribute.  I'm loving my Meepo - to an extent.  I've had it for over 6 months at this point & it's being ridden a few times a week at minimum.  I would recommend a longer version than the 30 inch I bought.  It handles well, is reliable & is quite fun.  Yeah, I did NOT get my Car Von which sucks - but I found a pre-built that stands behind their product.  

Side notes: 
My Meepo got shipped quickly.
It does have some JERKY/SUDDEN acceleration/braking- which sucks.  I want to upgrade the ESC & fine tune that part of it (but it works fine so I haven't got around to it). 
Motors are powerful & work well (mild hills, tall hills without expecting too much for a hub motor - you know it's NOT a belt drive, but it needs minimal maintenance).
Grip tape, trucks, motors, battery all work great!  This is probably after about 500 miles, but I'm done counting at this point.

Deck swap it for a drop through carvy cut away 36 upwards board and the twitchy shit goes away.  You won't look back.  I recently upgraded the esc to the hobbywing version and that is a big improvement too.  They make great back up boards and have fantastic customer service.  Best bang for buck starter board on the market right now.

Hi @Chase Sorry I disappeared from the internet (like Jerry... oof). Been really involved with life and honestly sometimes I forget this whole thing happened to me... then I remember, and get an instant hit of rage. Just wondering what's going on now. I don't come on this website very often because I have a onewheel and it serves me just fine. Read your post from back in May... did i miss the court case? I'd be willing to DM you my phone number so I don't miss anything.

Yeah whenever discussions were first occurring we concluded that each of us would have to file an individual small claim against him or try to start a class action lawsuit. I was willing to try to do that but it‚Äôs hard to get a lawyer for a business that has basically no assets and is going to go bankrupt before the case starts. At this point everyone pretty much dropped out of the conversation and stopped replying.

There should be a preorder banüòå
Or as min the vendors would need to include a ‚Äûfull refund if not delivered 3 month after promised delivery day‚Äú point into there terms and conditions.

It‚Äôs not only this case here.
Don‚Äôt want to know how much people lost there hard earned money on Kickstarter or indigogo projects they investigated in.

The sad thing about it is that you nearly can‚Äôt do anything, even if you involve a layer.

@Andy87 That would be hard though as most people will use the cash to start production.

At the end of the day, as a buyer you have to take the risk or don't buy and wait until it's ready to ship.

I'm sure most people mean no harm and they just so happen to not plan properly or ran into issues and didn't calculate properly.

Dexter, maybe you should hold a paid seminar for all those Kickstarter and Indigogo esk8 "businesses" and teach them how to successfully run this business. I'm still sure they (Carvon, JedBoard, etc.) didn't start their campaign with negative/criminal intentions, but they didn't forecast the expenses, time and R&D to produce a real product that can be delivered. Run out of money and decided to take the criminal route (Jed TBD).

BTW, your new AT wheels look awesome....Still deciding on them vs Trampa Hypa at the moment

Not really new. He had a large box of those clone wheels like two years ago when I went to his shop. He had them printed with the branding a few months afterwards to include with the EXO completes.

Not sure how the site got back up...or how it went down.

Between my brother and I we got scammed around 2000 USD by Carvon. I agree with you. I hope that no one gives him a penny. On my end I make sure to put negative comment wherever I see his name(s). He should just retire from this community. Shame on him.

Okay, hypothetical... 

*What if* against all odds everyone got everything they ordered and he started shipping parts and completes in a timely manner.... 

Would he be accepted back into the community after say 3 months if people see he changed his ways? It's happened a million times with enertion before, maybe people will just be happy with working goods and maybe let it slide? Or... Maybe I'm wrong. Again, all hypothetical.... I'm just curious to see and would love to see what happens if he got his shit in shape across the board and people's orders fulfilled finally.

it would help if jerry even knew what he owed to whom.

he's got NO paper trail or records of his orders, since so much of it was done through unofficial channels.

but, yea, if he squares up with everyone, we can start talking about it.

I have offered help, even transported stuff from Dave in OC to him in LA since I do that drive most weekends. I'm all for helping him when he didn't scam people. He went to the Vegas event and brought/delivered a drive to a customer there.

If he does attempt at a come back, he needs a lot of capital to make and deliver what is owed and a butt load of apologies and explanation and that still doesn't excuse his actions when he was financially back up against the wall. Low moral and ethics is hard to forgive
