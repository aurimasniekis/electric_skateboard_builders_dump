This is round two of my sufrodz press fit mounts for RKP 200mm hangers. 

- These come as a set of two, left and right. 
- Motor to motor distance is 168mm
- Holes are made to fit marc88 motor plates, but optional no holes for people who want to make their own motor plates. 
- For those looking to use a different plate or make their own, inside hole needs to be at least 29.5mm and the center to center of the M4 screws needs to be 46mm.
- I want to get minimum 10 sets before I get to factory to start cutting them. 
- My Paypal for those who have trouble with google sheets. lukeritchiedesigns at gmail dot com
- Price is $50 usd including shipping. Plus paypal fees if any. If you can send to me in USD that is preferable, paypals exchange rate is terrible. If not just try to send equivalent amount after fees. Thanks. :heart_eyes:  Edit: Paypal fee is $2.50 as seen after a few guys paid. 

More info and photos on the previous group buy thread. Seems like everyone was happy with them.

Would it be possible to make the same press fit mount but for the hex TKP? I would take a set of them and the RKP in a heartbeat

That's a pretty good idea. But I would want to have some TKP hangers to test fit as the tolerance is like 0.05mm. Not sure I would trust a cad model of them.  I don't have any TKP hangers at the moment.

Thanks everyone who signed up. We have over 10 sets now so it’s for sure a go. 

Sorry for no dates yet. The factory has gone on Chinese New Year vacation until the 12th Feb. unfortunate timing for this buy. Anyway if everyone can pay befor the 12th it will be helpful to get them done ASAP.

Its time for everyone to pay up now if we want to get this rolling soon. Factory is back from CNY tomorrow. 3 guys already paid. Now I can be sure the paypal fee is $2.50 so please transfer $52.50. 

![image|414x158](upload://kxxVR0cvEBbp14lCbZ7eRNiauDz.png) 



There are 13 sets spoken for on the sign up sheet, so thinking about asking them to make 15 sets. I can add more sets when they get close to actually cutting metal, should not be an issue for them. I did that on the last order. 

Also if you want the no motor plate holes option, please speak up now. :speaking_head:

I cannot imagine they would work, at all, given the nature of precision press fit components. I could be wrong but simply looking at pictures they don't look even close.

Would be crazy if they did fit, needs to match these dimensions. Just need someone to measure them to confirm if its a NOT EVEN CLOSE situation.

Fyi, if you are going to use 6880s with Marc's mount. You should talk to him directly and ask for longer mounts. cus the SR pivot cup will be in the way when you want your mounts higher off the ground.

What kind of Center To Center distance you talking about? I know he does several lengths. I got a custom super short 73mm CTC plate from him like a year ago which fits good for 50mm motors. I think his standard CTC is somewhere around 90mm.

Guys there is only one set left in this buy, everyone paid and they are currently being machined. :grinning::hugs::beers:

I am thinking of doing a round 3 soon, as the last two went well and people are buying up surfrodz like they are going out of production right now. Also looks like there will be 3 motor plate options to fit these coming for the next buy, not just marcmt88 plates. So that's cool too.

@Winfly @Bobby  If you want rear mount with 6380 size cans I suggest a center to center distance of at least 94mm. Maybe just go 95mm, not sure how accurate my surfrodz base plate is in CAD.

The image below is 95mm CTC with 6880 can, 96mm should fit ok.

Sorry been slacking on the tracking numbers. They don't tell you much though just when they left and when delivered I think. I updated them in the google sheet. 

![image|250x343](upload://oCzqSVcpkTuuFdaLy648Inzuy7q.png) 

Round 3 will be starting shortly. It will go much faster this time as no chinese new year to deal with and I can just put down the deposit for 20 sets pretty early and be pretty sure I can sell them all. 

There will be aluminum motor plates with idler made by @Boardnamics and carbon fiber ones by @moon to be compatible with my press fit mounts. In limited quantities. The exact details are not totally figured out yet, news to come on that. And you can still use @marcmt88 mounts also. 

I think the quantities for the motor plates will be about
5 sets for moon and 15 sets for boardnamics. The designs will look something like this but not quite final. 

![image|690x353](upload://eMThaVqinu6yzOHqCHW2Jrz2reU.jpeg) 
![image|690x299](upload://s2ByLSF5G44FN9ULh6kf12KPDKQ.jpeg) 

Price and payment arrangements for the motor plates is not final yet so don't ask, but I may be shipping the plates also. 

The price of my press fit mounts is now $54 a set. The $4 increase is to cover paypal fees, exchange rate and packing materials. Stuff I didn't factor in before. Shipping is still included in the $54. Additional charge for the plates but we have to finalize the price on that.

You can sign up to show interest on this google sheet, and I will create a new group buy thread when more details have been worked out.

Its getting close to wet season here. :cloud_with_rain: :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain: :cloud_with_rain: So I started working on printable a rain fender for my own use. But I will share on thingiverse when ready. 

Its a bit overkill to use these press fit mounts to hold a fender but hey why not. :man_shrugging:

If it is designed and fits in my build plate, I can print it.

Ok I have the bergs and rkps but the shoulder bolts are still en route so I can get you wheel (with tire I'm assuming) dimensions and then hanger offset later on. Thanks!

I got this + marcmt mounts, I'm having a hard time getting a combination of spacers position that aligned the wheel pulley properly. I either get too much of a gap or too close. Does anyone have a picture of it mounted? I have extended axels
