USA Group buy - Enertion Motor mount

It's a personal favorite of mine. Has been rock solid for me and my builds. Simple to mount to Caliber II trucks.

These mounts will fit 50mm motors (including @chaka's 50mm motors) and 63mm motors
------------------

I have tried them - they all fit perfectly

What's the advantage of doing this group buy?

Savings on the shipping from Australia if you don't reach their Free Shipping amount.

And 10% off your order

What's the ordering timeline?

ASAP

How do you pay?

I guess via PayPal. Once enough orders are in, I will request you make the payment for your items. Once I have the monies in the account, I will order the items and have them sent to me.

What's the cost of Shipping from Las Vegas?

Not sure, but will use the most economical way. Once I get a price for your shipping, I will request the last part of payment and ship them out to your location.

Notifications - 

I will post on this thread when items are purchased and any tracking updates that I receive. Once the items are received, I will reconfirm order, confirm shipping costs and send them out with tracking numbers.

If you are in a non-USA country...if it's cheaper for you to order through me I will do it for you and you let me know what I need to put on custom forms to avoid excess taxes.

Any edits to the conditions of this group buy will be made by me on this thread so all can follow along.

So, if you're down to get on this group buy Just PM me. Let me know how many mounts you wanna get ... And if you should need additional items such as pulleys or belts, please add that to your information and will see if we can work that into the group buy.

If you have any questions, please feel free to pm me.

*fits only Caliber II trucks 
*mount cannot be reversed so motor is in the rear
*you can have any color mount you want as long as it's blue lol

Let's do this!

Edit: Once I hit the magic number for Free Shipping...I'll let you know on this thread and will do a Last Call and close out the group buy

I might order a wheel pulley kit and extra belts.

It's definitely worth getting over a regular steel/aluminum wheel pulley right? Cheaper and easier to replace, not to mention,  and lighter.

Will it really take that long? We aren't getting a larger discount based on numbers after we hit the free shipping mark.... so might as well end it soon. 

If we end it by next week, when can we expect shipment from Enertion? 

PS: Is there anyway to get wholesale discounts for this stuff if we ask Jason?

It's really shouldn't take long once the order has been placed...I've never had an issue ..like I said the last time I ordered mount, pulley belts....it came in abt a week...but it was stuff i know he had in stock...but I will check and update all the peeps 

Bigger discount...maybe if we ordered a 100 mounts lol I'm ok with the free shipping from Oz and the 10% off the entire order .... It's not huge but it's def something

Once all the monies are recieved...Ill place the order and will keep you in the loop.

While we are waiting for the stuff... You can shoot me your addresses (except for the Vegas boys...Pick a Bar)....and it will help me figure out shipping cost.

And that it....I think ü§î

Well, I have already received a 6372 motor that I ordered after 6/20, The pulleys and motor both ship from AUS, and are listed as "in stock", yet I dont have any word... As I understand it the space cell ships from the US? Anyhow, I think "in stock" in Austrailian means something different than we are accustomed to here in 'Merica..

the shitty thing is, with this psycho mount and a 255 belt with 16/36 and 90mm wheels, I can spin it on the bench, but that is all I can do... And while I am at it, the 12mm motor pulley from diy seems not really wide enough... I would iike some 15mm wheel pulleys for abec's, where does one find these?

I am new to this stuff so bare with me, but I got a 12mm kit for Abec's from diy. it seems like the pulley is not wide enough. The belt is as close to the wheel as possible and on the wheel pulley there is about a little less than 1/8'' belt just hanging there doing nothing.. Did I tighten the nuts down too hard or something?

i can't tell if your joking, but publicity is not what causes deliveries to be delayed... it's stock shortages.

we have plenty of motor mounts in stock, shipping to US is normally 3 days, try to order on a Sunday in the US as its Monday here.

Ohh I see. You originally said the motor pulley was not wide enough so I was confused. You meant the wheel pulley isn't wide enough. You should definitely email DIY or @torqueboards about this. I'm sure he'll send you the correct part. If you do decide to complete change setups, I'd be interested in that motor pulley of yours if it's 16T ;)

Also what @Michaelinvegas said ^

Does it say on his website it is for abec flywheels? If so he probably should fix it...

It's worth noting that not all wheels are identical...

Our injection molded wheel pulley works in both clone style flywheels & real flywheels.

So....at the current exchange rate the motor mounts are $60.28 with our discount it's $54.25 per mount

There's still time to change or add to your order....


Once all the orders are confirmed I will PM your order once more with the total amount due with my paypal address ...

Anyone else want in?

Damn you @Michaelinvegas! You broke me. I can't hold out anymore. 

Put me down for a motor mount, 12mm wheel pulley, and 15t 9mm motor pulley.

And the motor pulleys still come with the grub screw, right? Cause I don't have keyways on my motors.

From the Website @Mobutusan 

**The pulley DOES NOT come with a set screw, Includes 3x3x18mm keyway piece.**

**Fitment on non R-SPEC Motors: If your motor shaft doesnt have a key way slot & circlip provisons simply grind a flat spot onto the side of the shaft, deep enough (1.4mm) for the key to fit tightly when the pulley is installed. Use the KEY as a wedge and hammer it into position. This pulley will be mechanically locked onto the motor shaft.**

Damn, that's what I thought, but the description from this page on Enertion's website still shows that it comes with a grub screw. Unless @onloop can can confirm that the motor pulley still has a grub screw, take the motor pulley off my order. I'll stick to the motor mount and 12mm wheel pulley only. Thanks!

Yes I just updated the last comment.. But I don't think everyone has $100 + in their PayPal account.. And some people do not link their bank account due to security concerns. So @Jinra it just depends on how the person is paying which makes it difficult for @Michaelinvegas to figure out..

the outside hanger is just aluminum ,,, hack saw or dremel...You wont cut through the steel core of the hanger....and just take it off and sand off sharp edges....just measure the width of a bearing

I'll take first class which automatically has delivery confirmation. It's the cheapest and safest route really. USPS priority is more than double the actual postage if others decide to get it. Sure you'll get it it a day or two faster but I personally want to save as much as I can!

@onloop if it's not too much, do you think I can get an Enertion SPACECELL sticker since my BMS went bad and I had to re-shrink wrap my pack once again. The old label/decal is no longer good. Hope you can give me a few pieces so I can stick it back on to look OEM again. Thanks!

I think it's just a slight defect in the nylon. Maybe the built-in bearing is a bit off center or there's extra plastic.

Anyone just a bit disappointed on the different color with the motor mount's blue? It's deeper now whereas I thought they kept it the same as the lighter aqua blue like the one I already have running. I guess the only way is to remove the anodization (these are NOT powder-coated like others are saying). Will indeed look funky with 2 totally different blue motor mounts mounting next to each other :(

Hey @Michaelinvegas my parts arrived yesterday. Some dude rode by on a mule with a cowboy hat and tossed them on my porch. Said the northwest passage was bit backed up but he finally made it :joy: :joy: 

I know there is another thread on the point, but did you ever decide if there was going to be another group buy from enertion? I remember you said you forgot to order something?

Cheers and thanks for your time.
