Hello,
As you know I made a GroupBuy for the big single motor drive systems.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sk3s-big-size-motor-group-buy-submitted-closed/13540

I got many suggestions to do a Dual Motor drive buy.
Just to get a count of how many people would be interested. 
If I can get a solid count, then I can probably get the motors at the same time as my other groupbuy. 
I asked for prices, so just give me a few days to post it here.

In the meanwhile, I asked for these motor types:

-Standard shaft (to keep costs low and delivery time faster)
-With and without sensors
-6355 (200/230/250)KV
-6364 (190/213/245)KV
These are not the final order types AND will be changing as more information comes to me.

@barajabali can you post a picture how they add sensors?

I could be in for 2x 6355 200kv with sensors depending on prices and shipping to sweden.

Is it possible to have them being made with 12 or 14awg silicone wire?

If the motors are not sensored then it will take about 20 days to get to me after they receive payment. If they are sensored they may take upto 40. Will have to see if the deadlines are the same for smaller motors as they were for the larger motors.

I'm in the US, shipping will be expensive to you. I don't know if there is a EU Groupbuy for this, Ajay had a Groupbuy 1-2 weeks ago, (just checked if he had any spares, seems like negative). 

I would recommend that if you want, you could organize the GB for EU, I can help with whatever you need.
Or if you really want me to ship to you that's fine with me.

There is no such thing as a 6S motor. When it is listed at 8S to 10S that just means that that is a suitable range. It will work with 12S and it will also work with 6S regardless.

Ok it sounds estrange to me that, because HK is narrowing the possibilities to sell these motors. Is not about efficiency ? I mean it will turn also with 2s but it will not be good this motor on that voltage. Just my 2 cents. I did burn of abuse 2 ntm propdrive 50-60 270kv on 6s and it was awesome. Now I'm upgrading to vesc and 6355 in my new build, new deck, completely new build. But with all the old stuff I want to build a skate for my friend, and is getting very difficult to find suitable motors for 6s. Anyway if you are sure about this motors running in 6s. Probably I'm in again.

I made a poll below, there's two of them. **Be careful**, I will look at the first poll as the primary order, if not enough people meet the MOQ, I will look at the second poll. 

**All motors will have sensors and silicone wire**
**Normal Key-way and shafts dimensions (make things easier to organize.).**

Make your first choice. 
[poll type=multiple min=1 max=1 public=true]
* 190 kv
* 215 kv
* 245 kv
[/poll]

Make your second choice. 
[poll name=poll2 public=true]

[/quote]

The biggest issue is how will you fit 2 6374 motor on a single truck.  You will probably have to do dual diagonal mounts if you want dual 6374's.  Probably the same for 6364.

As far as power, I run dual 6354's on 2 boards. I weight close to 200lbs and they both push me up hills and the 10s is as fast as the 3rd monkey on the way to noah's ark :slight_smile:

Loooool...yeah i've seen those! They also made me contemplate getting 6374. I wonder how the board feels/handles with such a wide stance? I guess 6364's will be a good compromise between the three. Assuming that 6364's are better than 6354's. Which i don't really know...

The major differences in motor size are the bigger they are the ore potential torque and the less heat generated.  Ive seen some 5065's that were pretty powerful, but nothing compares to 63mm power plants.

Seems more than logical to evenly spread out all of the costs. In an effort to get things going I've created a spread sheet to start writing what each person wants. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12tF3NRrTEQYwCVSXW_PMaZNqtMkZG0A9lHSEgUbkk7A/edit?usp=sharing

Please specify your order with the number of motors you want, size, kV and if you want a sensored or non-sensored version. I will update the sheet as i receive the info. Lets see if we can hit MOQ of all the desired versions.

I've updated the the excel sheet to contemplate both first and second choices of each user. That way it is easier to reach MOQ. So from now on please specify your order with two different options (you first pick and you second pick in case the first doesn't reach MOQ). 

Come on guys...lets buy some motors!

I travel from the US to EU several times a year. If EU users want to do a group buy i can jump on that one...problem with EU is you always gonna pay a lot for import taxes. I usually travel to Portugal and import tax there is 23% (VAT) plus a few other import duty stuff so prices may no longer be worth it...maybe another EU country can get a lower import rate.

When traveling to Portugal the airport customs usually stop everyone incoming from non-EU countries and search for people with items with the intent to sell. If you only have a pair of motors it should be OK. If you have 20 motors they might get suspicious. This is based on my experience in Portugal. Perhaps in other countries like The Netherlands (which are more liberal! :slight_smile: ) or Germany things can be different.

Hello everyone,
Now that my semester finished few days ago, I will have much more time to do my own build aswell as help finish this GB,

From my knowledge, @yummyblobs ordered quite a few motors in the  216kv sensorless 6354 class.
If you are going to get that, I would recommend buying them from him.

I will continue the GB with the remainder 
I asked for prices again,
->SK3-6355 (200kv or 230kv or 250kv) outrunner motor with keyway without sensor
->SK3-6355 (200kv or 230kv or 250kv) outrunner motor with keyway with sensor
->SK3-6364 (190kv or 213kv or 245kv) outrunner motor with keyway without sensor
->SK3-6364 (190kv or 213kv or 245kv) outrunner motor with keyway with sensor

If there is any other version someone would like to get, (WHILE MEETING MOQ=5) please comment.

They unfortuantely don't have the material to make the 6355 motor size, so they recommended going with 6364 and they would accept the MOQ of 20.

I asked for a quote sheet.
This is what the distribution for motors looks like
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12tF3NRrTEQYwCVSXW_PMaZNqtMkZG0A9lHSEgUbkk7A/edit?usp=sharing

Similar to how I organized the GB for large 6374 motors, I will use that same system for shipping.

(Your individual weight total / whole GB weight total)*shipping cost. This seems to be the fairest way to distribute the shipping cost.
Shipping from me to you should be roughly ~$15. Thats a medium size usps box, with ~$150-175 insurance.

**If you can find a cheaper way to send these motors, please let me know. If you want to send me labels thats also fine. I was told before to use bubble mailers, but I don't feel comfortable with that.** 
If you want that that's fine with me.

Main difference is the size, if your going to do a single motor I would recommend the 6364. Basically because bigger is better. I weight around 180 also, and I run the 6374.
Another difference would be that 6354 is better if you want to use two motors, because of its short size in legth, you can fit two of them on the same truck (depends on the truck).

@IGiraffeT
Having sensors helps on the startups and during the ride. It tells the Vesc where the motors orientation is to better send pulses. 
On initial start up it helps with not jerking the board to make a smoother startup.

So its just settings on the vesc that you have to put in on the software?  So if the setting get messed up would the vesc basically be dead?

---
## \#131 Posted by: wmj259 Posted at: 2017-06-14T16:28:05.818Z Reads: 82

```
Correct. If those settings get messed up then the vesc gets fried. You can however not plug the sensor wire in and leave it disconnected until you feel like your comfortable enough to later use it. 

From what I have used, I use FOC mode which has had bad rep for causing drv errors (if programed incorrectly) but it is a delight to use because the startups are smooth. 
You can also go bldc sensored or hybrid mode but I have not yet used those.

Ignore the PayPal payment fee, as I will be paying  by bank. Which has a $40 charge from PNC. I added $1.50 to every motor. I need to remind them if needed about the silicone wiring, and to have one continuous wire directly from the inside out.
The weights (from hobbyking website):
the 190kv : 1005g
the 213kv : 1013g
the 245kv : 1030g.
Final total weight for 21162g.

Final price for each motor, without shipping to you. 
the 190kv (nosensor) : $62.50+1.50+7.60 =$71.60
the 190kv (sensor) : $68.50+1.50+7.60 =$77.60
the 213kv : $68.50+1.50+7.66 =$77.66
the 245kv (nosensor) : $_____+1.50+7.79 =$_____
the 245kv (sensor) : $68.50+1.50+7.79 =$77.79

If everyone is okay with this, I can get a final PO and finish the payments up.
If you are okay with this, please message me your zipcode/state
If more than one person lives close by to eachother, I will message all involved and possibly help save on shipping costs. 

Just to mention again, like before I am not making any money, just want to help.

Why are they charging you shipping for each motor separately? If everything is going to you first, they should be able to ship in one package. Granted, it'll be a heavy package, but sure as shit cheaper than paying separate for each. Then we can just split up the cost depending on how many of us there are right, or am I missing something?

Sounds like these guys are jacking up the shipping costs. I've got some massive packages from Hobbyking, and at most, shipping was like $60. 

Probably not that massive though. That's gonna b a big'n.

I might be able to work with some of the Cali orders though if it'll help.

Yeah I have had a 30 boards sent to me from California and the shipping is only 140 and 5 boards is around d 20 pounds so that shipping is super high depending on the motor it could be just easier to get them from hobby king. After it's all said and done.

The only reason I did the first GB was because the manufacturer could customize the motors right from the beginning versus the stock HobbyKing motors are. I asked if they could do sensors, and they said yes, and then extended shafts for people that wanted to run 15mm belts, and then keyways and then silicone wires. (majority of these were free).

I originally only wanted 2 motors for myself, but because of the MOQ, 10, I thought it may be making it cheaper for everyone else aswell. 
But because a lot of requests for smaller motors that could run dual, I decided to help people out and make a smaller motors that could handle dual drive.

Also to add, the shipping is done by FedEx, so that may be one reason it is expensive, but from my experience, the chances of this $700-800-900+ box being lost is slim to nill. Aswell as this isn't all my own money so, this puts strain on whoever has to deal with it.

Yeah, I hit up Hobbyking awhile back to see if they'd do silicone wires. No go. I definitely don't mind paying a little more for the add-ons.

Except that these add on are mostly except the sensors,  HK makes a lot of money because they have a huge profitmargin.

I'm going to submit a final request for prices again because I changed a few orders around. I'm hoping to close around 12 tonight. That way I can have better idea what number sweat are working with and  how to fix a few issues with distribution.

Also just to note, I don't think 6364s will fit in a dual rear unless you do a forward and reverse mount system or dualdiagonal, you have trampa truck system or the new extended torqueboard trucks. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I was contemplating dual 6364 on paris 195mm trucks. Read somewhere on the forum that is will work but not sure of the source.

Yeah, had a issue come up a few days ago that kept me from posting, sorry.

So the same price applies as before except I added a 245kv no sensor version.

the 190kv (nosensor) : $62.50+1.50+7.60 =$71.60
the 190kv (sensor) : $68.50+1.50+7.60 =$77.60
the 213kv : $68.50+1.50+7.66 =$77.66
the 245kv (nosensor) : $62.50+1.50+7.79 =$71.79

I only got 4 responses on the online form.

Hi guys, 
Sorry to say, but I am in some issues now with my university school, and have to deal with some real-life situations. Because of that I won't be able to lead this GB anymore. I just returned every-ones payments. If someone can lead this, I can pass forth all the info needed. 
Once again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
