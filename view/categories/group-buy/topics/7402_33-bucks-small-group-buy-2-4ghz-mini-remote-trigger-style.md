haha.  I'll take two.  this is seeming the best remote and I've tried a lot.  I couldnt get the winning to work and just got the steez going and it's good but the brakes are awful and not smooth going downhill . you can barely modulate.  anyone know if this can be made better in ppm or something?

mr group buy!  the responsible patient man.  He maybe buy 6 and plan for crash

```

---
## \#28 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2016-08-10T04:20:44.133Z Reads: 267

```
the battery lasts a huge amount of time. all i could ask is that the unneeded wheel on top be cut off.  but maybe it will have a use.  I have told people its for turning and they think about that a while sometimes.  Ill tell people the board runs on nitrous if they ask.  sometimes I wished it was a bit more comfortable on the finger, but then again if it were soft it wouldnt have such quick action.

  I always end up using my middle finger and with all fingers extended pretty straight not really like a gun tight squeeze.   
 would like the steez but the brakes ...anyone else find them bad compared to this?
i heard something about different calibration points and maybe some controllers have more than others so you have a smooth throttle.  this was good out of the bag but even after lots of ppm changes and confirmation from one other person  the steez  has bad brakes.  this trigger was great downhill super smooth brakes.  I didnt do any changes on the vesc and just plugged it in.

why are these things expensive?  arent electronics all cheap these days

Yeah ...ill combine orders and try to do it the cheapest and safest way...don't need the remotes all banged up...

So I'll ask you guys after for the couple of bucks for the mailing ....

I didn't check how much to ship ... Because I figured it's so cheap a bunch of you would get two or three as back up and not sure how much the costs diffenence would be to mail one two or three...hence I didn't make it an all in price....

I'm so tempted to pick another one of these up, especially at this price, but this would be the fourth remote and fifth receiver for my only three boards currently. That means I would have to build another board. Which I have somehow accumulated enough parts for. Plus, I want to try the @mastercho remote too, once I finish the Mad Munkey...and so on. :anguished:

I guess I could just get another one of these remotes and build yet another board. I'll call this one "Snowball" in honor of this E-Crack fueled hobby, and hope it doesn't go careening out of control down a hill or something. Lol. It's only money, right? :smiling_imp:

The winning remote is not so good. Pros: Small, Light, rechargeable. Cons: very short throttle travel, throttle gets stuck sometimes(dangerous)
This one feels much more solid than the winning remote, and cheaper. just a bit big to put into your pocket. I only had one problem with this controller: always accidentally touch the trigger when carrying the board.

So...please take a look at the list ... Pleas make sure that the amount of remote you want are correct ...

If it is please chime in on this thread and send payment...

Once all paid up...Ill order the remotes ...

He said he will send them via DHL so should get here fairly quickly (I've ordered from him before)

Let me know how you want me to mail them...and that will be the additional postage cost that I will ask you for.

Thank you everyone !!!!!

Shame there's no reliable thumb controller that doesn't look like a vibrator. I've been doing some preliminary testing on the Benchwheel remote and things are looking good; might be purchasing them in wholesale if my testing yields good results. Unfortunately, the winning remote has reliability issues.

Sorry for the slightly off topic spam, was debating on joining the group buy :sweat_smile:

I'm sure its reliable, which is why I was considering jumping in, but I don't like trigger control which is why I decided against it. Maybe my Benchwheel remote will work great. As for the winning remote it worked 99% of the time, but that 1% is enough for me to not consider it. It only takes 1 malfunction to SYF.

The benchwheel looks good and looking forward to another group buy! 

 The "group buy" approach is revolutionary!  That sounds exaggerated but we are an example of real community instead of just individuals all isolated like idiots.      This is the cutting edge of empowerment.  This approach can make big things happen.  
 Looking forward to what comes next.

Sorry I wasn't clear and thanks I mean I know they are 2.4GHz, but there are different types of 2.4GHz. GT2B's receiver is AFHDS. Anyone have both of these that can be swappable?

They work great... even Metroboard is starting to use them ...

Small...take off the wheel and grind it down to make it smaller 

At under $40 bucks ... really can't go wrong

Hey guys.  I just bound this remote to my VESC and something weird is going on.  It seems the throttle is being controlled by one of the small white dials on top (left) and the trigger is doing nothing.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Thanks.
