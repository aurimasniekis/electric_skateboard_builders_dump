Are you going to fit your trampa build with these bad boys?

I wonder if they’ll fit surfrodz rkp/tkp with janux mounts or psychotiller mounts.

If not, it will be a no-go for me, as I want RKP and stuff from @psychotiller

To all guys in the poll... pls send a message to @hyperIon1 and place in the message that you are in the EU. So he can ship all motors for the eu groupbuy to me. I will send it to you from Belgium.

hope we will get a data sheet from @hyperIon1 soon.
for what we have now it looks just like a 6374 with bigger bell...
hope the specs say something different.

They are working on one. But with the stator and winding of the 6374,  keep in mind bigger magnets at 190kv won’t be a step back. With the addition to the new bearing should prove to be a superior motor both in power and durability
