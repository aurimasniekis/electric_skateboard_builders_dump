Pricing not confirmed - its all dependant on paypal fees and bank fees etc. But ‚Ç¨110 is a good estimate

Be careful with this ESC, has anyone tried it before? 
Compared to it, Maytech's more reliable and mature, but their disadvantage is not good at advertising. 
However, all believe product is more important than advertising.

Is this going to happen soon?

I definitely want one. Seems to be the cheapest option out there for vesc based 4 series that can run foc like focboxes, at least unproven. 

Don‚Äôt really need it since I got escapes coming but I have no idea when they‚Äôll arrive sothis is a good alternative for now.

Just to double check they work with the vesc tool right? I am sure they do but I couldn‚Äôt find any info stating this on their site.

Just a tip for the people that wants to buy one directly, if you like their Facebook page and msg them you get 20% / 20USD off your total order i opted for the 20% of my order and ended up getting the VESC for not much more then what this groupbuy was.

not 100% sure, there are problems with it when using 12s i think.

But ask someone else or read it here somewhere, because its not clear to me

Yeah mine is good, my friend took my faulty one upgraded the caps on it and did some clean up on the pcb and managed to get it fully working in 12s foc on e bike hub motors.

It had minor cutouts before he upgraded the caps.
