Ok, but I guess you'll want to have it delivered to your address in France?

Correct! I think the shipping cost from enertion eu-warehouse is similar to both sweden and france so shouldn't be a problem.
Can you confirm @onloop?

@ExFr: I'm ready to order whenever and we can use my credit card if you transfer funds to me.
I know that there's a certain level of trust needed for collaborations like this and we can use a middle man if @Michaelinvegas is up for the hassle again, but there will be conversion fees.

I've already lost about $50 in fees when I sent Mike money and he sent back less than 24h from 5x group buy because shipping 4 boards to USA and 1 to sweden was complicated so I would rather see that you and med can work something out on our own. I can provide you with my full info with address, workplace etc if needed.

Well at the very least half a million....

A customer a while back when I was a casino host asked me to walk him to his buddy's room and then back to his room....I went along with him... stopped at his mates room and picked up a big duffle bag ðŸ’¼... shit was heavy...He said help me with that ....so I picked it up and walked out into the hall....as we where walkin' down ...he says, "How's it feel walking around with with half a million dollars?" ...Bag had cash and diamonds ðŸ’Ž.... yeah....abt the only time I thought abt making a run for it lol

If it was in AUD I could tell you lol

But it's USD 899 plus shipping 

The exchange rate changes it a little so it's around that price

@mrpj: Where are you located?
Me and @ExFr are already working on a 2x group buy. I think it will be more expensive with a 3x, but I'll look into it.

There are only 3 left for the first tier of the 2x group buy.
@mrpj: how soon can you transfer money via bank wire if @ExFr doesn't come through?
```

## \#22 Posted by: mrpj Posted at: 2016-12-15T07:03:10.837Z Reads: 150

@rwxr
Almost instantly - depends just on the processing time of my bank to yours

Ok, how about this:
I will purchase the 2x today and @ExFr has until friday evening to show proof of transfer. If he doesn't, I will give you his spot.

If he comes through and you still want in, we can change the pledge to a 3x but there will be a slight increase of price.
Sounds good?


Calculations in euros:
**2x first tier:** 
Boards - AUD 2436
Shipping - AUD 140
**Total: AUD 2576 = EUR 1822/2 = EUR 911 per board**
-----------------------
**3x first tier:**
Boards - AUD 3654
Shipping - AUD 240
**Total: AUD 3894 = EUR 2753/3 = EUR 918 per board**

Sorry for the delayed response.

Your idea sounds good. I just checked and there was only one 2x package left and thus went ahead and ordered it. So when @ExFr doesn't come through we can team up and sort out which order will go through

Otherwise I have 1 spot left for anyone interested

I've pm:ed @mrpj and said that I'll do the 2x which he ordered with him. All 2x for 899 is gone now.

If you get your wire transfer working, maybe mrpj can change it to a 3x for us all. Or maybe @mrpj will take paypal?

@rwxr @ExFr
I don't mind changing it to 3x .. just someone needs to tell me what to do . Just pledge more money?

You can send money via PayPal (the PayPal friends option or otherwise I would need to pay 2Ã· fee :() or wire transfer.

We're already a full 3X if @ExFr is coming through.
Sending money to stranger is always a risk and I don't know any other way to do it. Your best bet is maybe to find 1-2 friends that you know to join you in a group buy.
