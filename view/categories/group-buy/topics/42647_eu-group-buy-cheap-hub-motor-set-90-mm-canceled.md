These are not changable, but the urethane should last a good time.
I choose this typ, because of all the slipping problems of hubs with a changable design. 

You have to pay a good amount more, to get some nice ones, that don't have a slipping issue.

I would be also interested, but why 155 Euro if I might ask?  I don't want to insunate anything, just understand as potential buyer. I mean that what I figured it out, please feel free to correct me. On the website they are 118$ for one pair, 88$ for 10. I think the shipping cost is 38$ for one and would it be free for 10. Buying one you have the chance to don't pay the custom, ordering 10 you will pay it for sure. Usually they lower the declare value, but even with tthe real one you would have 88$*10 = 880 + (VAT 20%) 176 + Custom duty ?$ = 1056 + Custom duty (Really depends on the items, we could suppose 100$) = 1156$ meaning 940.56Euro.  So 94 Euro each + shipping in EU is something beetween 8Euro (DHL) to 30 we would reach 130 as max. If they declare let's say 500$ instead of 880$ (still reasonable price) the cost would be even lower. As I said I just want to understand. PS: I know the VAT is calculated on purchase cost + shipping, but I am pretty sure they can fit the cost of shipping buy lowering the price on the invoice).

```
So let´s see:

If you order one:
118$ + 38$ shipping + VAT20% = 187,2$ + Paypal conversion fee Euro to Dollar

If we order 10:
88,50$ + 30$ shipping (they only offer free shipping for board kits, I asked Jason) + VAT20% = 142,2$ + Paypal conversion fee + shipping from me to your door. So 155€ should be ok, without me getting rich.
Problem here is indeed the 298$ shipping from China. They don´t offer it for free…

So of course you can order one by yourself and maybe slip through customs and safe a buck.

If you order with me you don´t safe a brutal amount of money, but you don´t have to deal with anything, other than opening your package :wink:

Sure!
I asked the same- it even shows free shipping when you place the order.
They will cancel it later and tell you the right amount if you order things like that in bulk.

Free shipping unfortunately only for board kits :frowning:

I have seen it too. it is possible. Below a comment I wrote on reddit:
"IF it can help recently verreal sells the replacement alone https://verrealboards.com/collections/all and as you can see you can use it also for the DIY hub motors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sZe1fZkIm8. OK not just the PU but the price is still good. Differently if yo want the smaller 83mm hub motor you can go for the winboard ones (they asked me 230$ shipped) predator banshee's motors, or the one sold by DIY similar to the backfire ones (http://www.diyeboard.com/replaceable-pu-hub-motor-8352mm-450w-for-diy-eboard-p-626.html). Hope it helps."

pretty sure yes. You have to think the other way around: If they are not changeble, they won´t slip and you´ll have much more fun with it! They should really last a good amount of time before you have to change something.

Guys, i´m still in contact with the manufacturer and he will check everything again and will try to give us a better deal regarding price with shipping!

So let´s see what they come up with!

I didn't really understand your question. Anyhow you can both use any ESC or VESC. In term of cost you could go for an Dual ESC (meaning one ESC drives two motors) from diyeboard itself (so probably you can add it to this order directly) or buy a 2 cheap VESCs from hobbyKing or the dual Maytech VESC (only one needed)  (under 100 euro solutions). If you can spend more any VESC will work, but you need two of them. I hope it is more clear now. The only question I have still open is whether is possibile to connect the sensor cable to the VESC from this motor to run them sensored. Maybe we can ask Jason about it

I was wondering whether someone knows how to connect the sensor cable from this motor to a 4.12 VESC. I know the pins are different. Is it possible just t re-solder them? Otherwise would be cool to ask Jason directly about it.

I already messaged them about the price and they´ll figuring something out.

Sensor is a smaller connector than on the vesc. You have to get an adapter:
https://eskating.eu/product/sensors-adapter-jst-2-0mm-6-pins/

or you can solder one.
```

## \#36 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2018-02-25T08:05:30.950Z Reads: 140

So it is 2mm 6 pins on the VESC and 1.5mm 6 pins on the motor. Right?

Yes, i just cut them and soldered the proper connector on. Just ask for the hall sensor connector adapter wire for your Vesc´s. The hubs don´t have a temperature sensor so you leave one wire out on the JST 6 pin connector.

Theoretically since the jst connector goes inside in one direction only we could see the order by comparing the picture of the cable with the ESC they sell it. Of course we still need to know the order on the ESC.

Thanks or the answer! I was wondering if I could go with just one VESC for both motors (the dual Maytech one + shipping is too expenvive as I've got a really tight budget), but as far as I can understand it's not possible.

I think the best solution for my idea (a very "light" build for low speed in the city) is a single hub motor, although I haven't been able to find one anywhere (i'd need the whole kit for front and rear truck). I did notice the maytech kit, but many people told me it's not reliable... I am waiting for Torque Boards to put their Single Hub motor kit back in stock but it's been a long time and they still haven't. I'd love to buy the hubs of this topic but I'd waste my money because I don't really have much knowledge yet and I believe I should start with a single hub + a single VESC... :roll_eyes:

In my opinion depends on the budget you have. I am not sure you will save money with the single hub motor kit from torque boards. To me the simple and cheap but still good solution for you would be this hub motors plus the the dual esc they sell which is already paid with the remote. In future you can always upgrade to dual VESC (you need two) or the dual Maytech VESC (only one needed). The kit I suggested would be plug and play. Other option two VESC from hobbyKing. A guy here is selling two of them brand new for not a lot.

I already have asked Jason, and it’s not possible without adaptator or soldering to the pins, anyway I plugged mine without sensors and the hubs have even more torque then ! 
You just have to push start so you don’t get anny cogging so no need for sensors imo

Sweet. I am currently running these hubs but the 250 watt version from Wowgo board with FOCBOX. Together with 10s2p Sanyo battery from Meepo board. I am maxing top speed at 34 km now.

motor min 60.0 A
motor min -45.0 A
battery max 45.0 A
battery min -15.0 A

Still need to bypass the bms which I think should give me 40 kph. Or maybe these 250 watt motor simply can't and these 1000 watt motors will.

To me in the cheap zone they are the more reliable one. @diyeboard is the company behind it and they sell it to wowgo, meepo, verreal ecc... so there are a lot of good reviews on them. Moreover on the website they should be the stronger version 500W compare to 250W presents on the pre-built boards.

He posted in this discuss too before. He is pretty happy with them and got a higher speed than you with these hub motors. I also not sure they are different but we should ask Jason whether they sell two different versions.

[quote="goldrabe, post:67, topic:42647"]
The motors from Meepo and the diye ones are the same.
[/quote]

That is not true, by any stretch of the imagination.  

That's like saying a small block 350 and a Toyota V* are the same because they have 200HP from the factory.  The 350 will beet the yota hands down every time because of startup torque, the ability to adjust the level of choke, fuel flow and carb chamber size.

Just because the KV is 'said' to be the same doesnt mean it is.  In my experience most motors are not within 5% of their rated KV and the chinese unbranded motors are worse than most.

I also think they are not the same, at least I hope so :smiley: It's also true that meepo ecc gets the motors from diyeboard. Maybe the keep the "sport" model for their webshop.

Don´t get me wrong, we are not talking about torqueboard hubs.
We are talking about the generic ones from diyeboard.com. The ones without replaceable Urethane. As far as i know they are from the exact same factory then the Meepo ones.
I got them here and i am running them with VESC´s my topspeed does not exceed 40Km/h even with 30 Amps Batt Max.

The 250 watt hubs have crazy amount of torque when I set batt max to 45. It will throw me off, unless I really stand low and lean forward.

Still wonder then wat the watts actually represent in terms of performance then

Yes I read that and don't see how I am getting to 40 kph. Must be the bms bypass then or I don't know what. 40 kph is fine with me although I think that might get slow pretty fast too. I thinkm sweet spot for me would be 45 kph

They are good for what they are.
For me the torque is enough, the Maytech hubs have more torque, but overall i like the the ones you are getting better. Less heat better Urethane, more quiet. I am a 200 lbs guy and they even drag me up some Japanese hills. But that might have caused my Vesc to die.
You will have plenty of fun with them.

But we've quite a few wheel options in EU.

No problem. Anyhow I come from a pre-built board so I had to learn everything from scratch. You will see that in this forum there are all the knowledge that you need. Belive me that if you are planning to build a hub motor drive with a modest budget this set is a good deal. I am also bulding my first board.

Actualy mine are a bit more powerfull with 500w it’s the 90 mm version
@caprabianca Man we all been to this stage one day.
More than 2 years ago I bought a cheap chinese board that broke the first day. At this time there wasn’t meepo and all all the chinese boards were garbage I was so frustrated and understood that what is reliable is what you can repair and maintain by yourself. I remember when i ordered all the parts from enertion ( enertion was selling DIY parts in the past ) i panicked upon order telling myself i would never make it and loose all my savings in this ( raptor 1 parts was super expensive ). In the end it’s among the best things i have did with my hands, and it’s thanks to this community.
Just read and read every thread you can find some piece of information that can help you better understanding evrerything. Most of us was to the same point you are today donnt give up, read a lot and ask you as many question as you can and in a matter of weeks you ll be able to make your board.

I know it and I hope so. Although several people are claming that there are no difference between the 90mm hub motor on diyeboard (500W) and the one on wowgo, meepo, ownboard ecc.. (250W) since they buy the components from diyeboard. We should ask Jason about it. Now I am curious.

It´s not replacable, it´s bond to the motor housing, that you don´t get any slipping urethane.
If you wanna replace it you´ll have to replace the motor bell - i think someone posted a link here where you can buy new ones for cheap.

When the urethane is done, just buy new motors - still cheaper than lot´s of wheel options :smiley:

I also had the idea of using fiber reinforcements to keep the wheel at a consistent diameter, no matter the speed- you'd simply put a small spool of fiber in the mould and pour over it. Would the urethane bind well to glass fiber? I have a vacuum pump in case of bubbles but urethane seems insanely thick and annoying to work with-bubbles would be the biggest issue I anticipate.

You can cast your own wheel with the other design of DIYeboard the same Hub that @PredatorBoards use for the banshee

It’s the hubs used in this kit : http://www.diyeboard.com/7s2p-44ah-swappable-battery-esc-kit-with-swappable-dual-hubs-p-644.html?zenid=s5q6jms1hcsqtoic4rafvp5u55

Nope this hub is a new version that was launched early this year it’s a bit more powerfull than the classic meepo/wowgo hub that we all use and this GB is about. 
See some reviews of the banshee to see how they are. 
In this design you can replace the PU but they only offer 83Mm with high duro so it’s not great
If you decide to cast some extra wheel and be down to sell spare i’ll buy a set as well the only thing that bothered me was 83mm..
They are 1000 W instead of 500 i believe

I also had a look at this 83mm hubs http://www.diyeboard.com/replaceable-pu-hub-motor-8352mm-450w-for-diy-eboard-p-626.html. They indeed seems the one Predator Banshee uses although thought Predator does buy 
the parts mainly from Winboard. Does Windboard buy from Diyeboard? ON the website they are rated 450W each but indeed by the predator review they go faster than the meepo ones. I like the size, because under the spud they will fit better to me. They do not have the shining silver part on the side (I am gonna paint it on the meepo one). What stoped me were the lack of reviews compare to the well known 90mm hubs that 100s of paople use and the thread http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/psa-why-small-hub-motors-overheat-and-fail/35056.

I wish i could help you guys but I already have some... if upgrate the PU is not worth 130 eur unfortunately 
I can’t really tell mate all this chinese stuff is nonsense i am not even sure diyeboard is the suppliers of everything as they say there’s no real proof or confirmation from other side 

About this thread it’s hard to tell at this time there was lots of controversy... hummies had broken axle and some motor failed 
Enertion was developping the R2 hubs and there was lots and lots of skepticism about those 
Overall I felt at this time the thread was only some « political » move in the esk8 community 
Hummie was somewhat trying to say all hubs except the next design i’ll do will fail at leat that’s how i got it at the time the thread went up. Haven’t read it since months. 

I wanna say that so far meepo hubs have proven they never fail, are robust AF. Only downside is the PU but that’s another story.

Finding the originator for all these component sources is like looking down a mirrored rabbit hole. I will say this; most hub motors are made by unheard of manufacturers. Most of the 'manufacturers' we know about are in fact middlemen.

Since I created that thread, I’ve learned a bit more about controlling the heat of small hub motors. The real key it to limit watts. You can do this by calculating your max watts (max amps x average voltage) or use watt control mode with a watt limit. My problem is simply I want more torque than small hubs can do. I’ve found 5000-6000 watts con is a nice amount. I split that by 4 and I get 1250-1500 watts con per motor. I’ve been the only one testing Hummies v4 motors and my results have been great. Simply doubling the stator size, doubling the magnet size, and increasing the copper by 1.6 times has resulted in great acceleration with no over heating issues. When I tried to pump 1000 watts with those small motors, they cooked very quickly. Probably more like 500 watt motors. Run them at that, and they won’t over heat like I experienced. But the acceleration is so weak, even in 4wd, at 500 watts. So you can chose weak acceleration with small motors or good acceleration with bigger motors. Having larger magnets and stator and more copper also means lower resistance, which means less heat, which results in better efficiency. I’m  depends on your riding style, but I ride with cars. They don’t pass me because I accelerate at the same rate as them and can go the same speeds as them (as long as the speed limit is under 35 mph). Hummies new wind has cut the resistance in half again, so the v5s will be supper efficient and can run high amps to give you great torque. We should have the first assembled v5 motor tonight and I hope to have 4 of them running by the end of next week at the latest with my new hollow core deck. Super exciting times!

Great thanks for the explanations. So if I understood correctly let's take my setup. I will run 10s3p 30Q battery (rated 15A or 20A actually from real discharge test) total costant current 45 or 60A, we can say 50A as deal, so 37V * 50A =  1850W /2 = 925W available for each motor. Since the motor are rated costant 500W and 1000W peak they will stay cool only when they run < 500W. Is it a correct thinking? Thx for your input.

There’s a few ways to look at it. That will ensure you don’t cook them, yes. But you might be able to set them to 750w even.
```

## \#157 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2018-03-02T20:12:14.310Z Reads: 103

```
So basically we can start from 500W and than go higher and keep an eye on the motor temperature to see if they overheat when they reach the max watt set. If no we can increase a bit the max W until we find a sweet spot between temp/performance. Could it be an idea?

Yea, I was thinking of suggesting that to you this earlier in the morning today, haha.

It doesn't still mean things can't break. Heat and slipping wheels are small hubs biggest problems. But if they do a sloppy job gluing magnets, or use the wrong epoxy for gluing the magnets or the damaged the winding in the motor assembly process, fixed it, and their fix failed, theirs still a lot that can go wrong. To be able to have tight control of the assembly enviroment is one of the reasons hummie and I chose to wind and assemble our hub motors ourselves.

Thank you for all the advice.

just can’t wait to see how they perform and try hard them this summer. 
While we are there - quick off topic - do you still think you will make bigger wheels with front matching or is it something hard to pull out at your scale ? 
More urethane with hubs is always a good bonus

On the Meepo hub note I have used them for approx 4 month now and using them at 50A and i don’t get any unbearable heat. I mean the carvon V3 heats much more under same hills, but carvon would have more power and will go faster for sure. I wish they had temp sensor ( meepo’s ) so I could have numbers. Carvons get really hot up to 93 degrees celcius ( see there : https://metr.at/r/0o1nJ )

I had one refund, so 4 Places are taken at the moment - 6 more orders to go!

If someone is interested in the timeline:
Should be about one week from china to customs, 2 days at customs, i will ship them as soon as i get them, so about another week to your door.

Jump in guys to make this happen and help us get a nice deal on these!

I am really interested in these Hub motors but I have a question:

If the Urethane needs to be replaced, I need to buy a replacement with the Rotor inside? So I can not replace only the Urethane on this Motor? ...

And where do I get these cheap?. I would rather order this Hub motors including a replacement kit for the urethane. Thats the only thing which is keeping me from placing my order!

Thanks for your effort to get such a good offer!
Greetings from Germany
Ron

Hey Ron!

Sure, jump onboard :slight_smile:
These hubs should probably last a good amount of a few hundred kilometers - i haven´t actually see someone replacing it. If you need to replace them on some point in the future, there are some vendors selling replacement kits including the bell and everything you need like:

Thanks for the tip. So this groupbuy can not include a set of spare urethane replacement Rotor?

Shouldn't it be possible to get the urethane off of the rotor and cast and bond/glue a new one over the rotor?

I am building a compact 10s3P cruiser Build under the Jucker Hawaii Mini cruiser Board: https://www.juckerhawaii.com/JUCKER-HAWAII-mini-cruiser-WOODY-BOARD-KAPUA

So with the Small space under the deck I would prefer to go with hubs. It would be my every day commute board. 

So your groupbuy offer comes perfect, but the thing with the non, replaceable urethane over the rotor keeps me back from ordering. 
Could you give me a day to think it through?

The seller we're buying from does not offer replacable cans, you have to get them from somewhere else.

Sure, take your time and let me know, we're waiting for a few more orders to come in to proceed.

I exchanged some emails with Jason and he kindly provide the information we needed about the sensor wire...
![HUB and ESC wiring sequence|690x486](upload://5gBIGolO9rkFoP4la1ybTcurEhL.png)

As you can see the ground is black, the 5V is red and the other 3 are the all sensored wire. On the VESC you will find 6 pins instead of 5, so you have to leave it one empty since the temperature sensor is missing on this motor. The same information will be updated on the website too. :sunglasses:

How thick is the urethane btw?

And I think there must be a way to put on the Urethane by yourself. Okay. you maby need to glue it onto the rotor but I think it should be doable.

A friend of mine is also considering to get one of those.

Hey,

so if we were 10 people, how much would it cost? I saw on diyeboard there is a 32% discount (97.20 USD per hub motor). Including taxes (30%?) and shipping (108 USD) this should be $1372 in total. So $137 (or 111 EUR) per person. Now shipping costs need to be included. Final price should be around 125 EUR, right?

Groupbuy is canceled due to the low interest. I refunded everyone.

For those who joined - thank you anyway guys :slight_smile:

The single price is really good and you should get them for about the same price if they slip through customs!
