Hey guys,
I'm looking into buying a charger with adjustable voltage from 36V to 42V from China.
Here are the specs:

Adjustable voltage 36V-42V (10S) or 43.2V to 50.4V (12S) with external knob
Current: 5A+/- 10% error
Plastic enclosure and fan. 
5.5mm dc plug (other options available)
Size: 16cm x 8.5cm x 5.6cm
Over current, over voltage short circuit and reversed connection protection. 
Dual LED indicator (red=charging, green=fully charged or no load)
Price: $30 for 10S version, $37 for 12S version.

Adding an aluminum enclosure raises the price about $20.

The reason I want it to be adjustable is so I can set my batteries to storage without disconnecting from BMS.

This group buy is open world wide and will ship straight from manufacturer to you. 

There is a second group buy going on by @Norco  for EU people only I think but it's for a completely different charger. Check post 60 for details. 

Cheers!

I sense fire if this charger is really putting out 42 V at 5 amps. I am assuming the battery pack is at least 5 cells in parallel.

You can do a storage charge without disconnecting the bms. Just turn the charger off before the batteries are fully charged. I don't think it's necessary to balance them for storage if you charge the pack to 36v for Li-ions 
Although, if you can get a custom 5-10a 42v charger for under $40, That's a good deal.
My 42v 5a charger from battery supports cost $53 plus $30 shipping

I would have to be constantly looking and paying attention to voltage while charging in order to stop it at the right time. With this, I only have to set it and forget about it. I can disconnect it a few hours later knowing the pack won't go over storage. This would be great as my gf is not the most attentive person lol (Build is for her). 

Yikes! That's expensive! I think I paid $45 for my 42V 5A charger including shipping.

I'm also looking for a similar charger (4amp +) with a 41/42v cut off. Seems there are a fair few of us looking. Even if a group buy doesn't come out of this it would be good to share links to what we find. I really liked the look of the one White Pony used (Modiary) but they no longer sell single units and MOQ on Ali is 50!

@PXSS I'd be interested; I want a charger that I can adjust to 41V, just to elongate cells lifespan and to avoid hitting the overcharge threshold due to regen (as unlikely as that is). I'd even settle for a 2A version that is adjustable.

Just realised that this wouldn't be suitable for me as I don't have a BMS and the over current protection it too high to act as a cut off. I have fitted a balance plug during my battery build so maybe I bite the bullet and add a BMS!?

Could you just add a step-down voltage regulator to your power supply?  Run at full voltage for charging, and step it down for storage

Like this one here (But hopefully much cheaper): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FNVESV2/ref=twister_B01HCXSSA6





I'd be interested in a 12S adjustable power supply, but I feel I am in the minority. 10S seems to be much more popular here.  Maybe you could expand the adjustability up to 50.4V to suit everyone?

I could but I'm really going for simplicity here. I am not the main user of the board. The board is for my girlfriend so I'm trying to make it as user friendly, hassle free (and cheap) as possible.

The less components I have, the fewer components can go wrong. 

I'll see what I can do. The lady I've been talking to has been very accommodating so far so I think I can make it happen as long as it doesn't carry a premium.

Maybe you should read your PMs more careful lol

Anyways, I messaged them a few days ago and this is what they replied 

Hello, thanks for your message, 
yes, we can adjust the output voltage to 41V . 
you can order the charger directly if you need. and let us know the plug type also.

Haha sorry @jujet props to both of you then. 

I think there must be a saving to be made for us EU guys if we buy together. 

I would be wanting cutoff of 41v and probably the 2.1/5.5mm plug socket. (if someone can point me in the direction of a socket that would take the amps) 

Happy to run a group buy for this if that's what it takes.

thanks @PXSS do they suggest the shipping charges? Sometimes the shipping fee can ruin an otherwise good deal!

@smurf that seems like a promising option as long as the adjustment they make to the final charge voltage is accurate.

Everyone promise that they'll keep a close eye on these "adjusted" chargers for the first few uses OK? If someone at the factory mistakenly makes the wrong adjustment you could accidentally overcharge your cells :rotating_light::fire_engine:

Ok so the ebay seller has come back on the charger. If we can find 5 buyers it would be $35 dollars each with free DHL shipping to the UK. ($30 is we get to 10 but I don't think that is likely unless they would ship to 2 different address).

We can ask for all of the cutoffs to be set at 41v or 41.5v - I have just noticed on the listing that it is 2USD more if you want the automatic cut off (something I would need). 

Do you think we can get to 5?

EDIT

I have responded and asked for 5+ and 10+ prices with the battery cut off added and set to 41v. I have also asked that if we can get a group together to buy 10+ but with them split over 2 addresses (US/UK) if this would get us the discount.

Hey, so most BMS start balancing when almost full, no? so if you terminate the charge early you'll never balance?

I'm running no BMS, and one of those ali bulk chargers, trim pot adjusted a bit lower for cutoff, and on a wall socket timer.

Hm if it's for your gf, this might be relevant. I'm going to build a charging stand, with the charger, timer and a voltmeter/wattmeter/ah-meter built in. I suppose links would help...

[power meter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YY1KU0G/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) the 20A ones can just go inline. Mine reads 0.2v high around 40v though...

[bulk charger 4a](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/180W42V4A-electric-vehicle-lithium-battery-aluminum-shell-charger-manufacturers-direct-sales-AIR/32466528311.html) I chose XLR, which I like but is a bit bulky. These guys all have a trim pot to adjust cutoff voltage. They _may_ be crap build, haven't figured out how to differentiate the crap ones from the good. Mine have been through maybe 20 cycles, good so far

I'm using this [timer switch](http://amzn.com/B014SGCN88), can set to any number of minutes, and it remembers. for the stand I'll probably go to [this one](http://amzn.com/B014SGCIR4) and like a wall switch to cut the power.

Hmm now that my brain's cooking, does the BMS allow you to set a lower cutoff voltage?

Yep. That's why I want a pot in it so I can still balance every once in a while. But having my cutoffs between 41V-28V means that my battery should be safe even if slightly out of balance. The BMS still protects the cells when any of them reaches 2.5V and not just the entire thing. 

That is pretty cool! I might look into doing something similar at home maybe! Thanks for the awesome idea!

I like the timer switch idea! That's pretty clever

Does your power meter seem pretty accurate?  I have this inline one that I use during charging and bench testing, but I am somewhat disappointed with its precision: https://www.amazon.com/Tenergy-Precision-Meter-Analyzer-Backlight/dp/B017YCTRKK/

Unfortunately the voltage always reads about 0.2 - 0.4 V high.  The faceplate also came attached upside-down.. which I only realized _after_ I had soldered on XT-90 connectors. So I had to re-solder everything since it only measures current in one direction

It really should be in an aluminum case with a fan to keep it cool especially running at 5-10a.
My 5a charger that I got from battery supports is in an aluminum case with a fan.
I also have a 42v 2a charger that is in a plastic case with no fan and it gets pretty hot while charging.
You might want to see if they can quote one with upgraded case and fan.

I have 2 meters, one reads high, and amazon reviews indicate it's consistently off by the same amount. But it's still within spec. The other reads low. I tested with a good multimeter so I know how far they're off. Made a p-touch label with the offset.

I think the offset throws off the watt-hour meter though, which is super useful for getting ballpark state of charge.

I'm pretty sure there are meters that can be calibrated. Maybe if I get bored I'll try to hunt one down.

I've been finding it's a pain to make this adjustment. You have to catch the charger after it switches from CV to CC, but changing the cutoff changes that point. So you have to drain the battery down, repeat, get frustrated and give up. :) I find this is more aggravating with the 4A charger, things change so quickly.

It has a fan, she's sent me a picture of the inside.
Also the 42V 5A charger I got from them before is in the exact same enclosure with fan and remains pretty cool.
Upgrading the case to aluminum was $20 more.

I would not change it while charging, I will calibrate it during the first charge cycle and mark the 36V, 41V and 42V point in the pot so that every subsequent charge, we just set it to either storage, full, or balance before we connect the board to the charger.

I have had a response from the ebay seller here:

Hello, 

Yes, we can adjust the output voltage to 41V and cut off. If you need the automatic shut off function on each charger, the price is 2 usd/pcs more. 
Yes, we can do the shipping 5 pcs to UK. 5 pcs ship to US. total make 10 pcs. 
The 5 pcs chargers shipping to US, do you need the input 110-220V, or also input 220V like in UK ? 
If need 5 pcs input 110-220V , the price for this is 2 usd/pcs more. 

So total : 

5 pcs 36v 4.5a LIthium battery charger with automatic shut off , Free DHL shipping to UK. 32 usd /pcs. 
5 pcs 36v 4.5a LIthium battery charger with automatic shut off , Free DHL shipping to US. 32 usd /pcs. 

If 5 pcs 110-220V 36v 4.5a LIthium battery charger with automatic shut off , Free DHL shipping to US. 34 usd /pcs. 

Best Regards
Stephy 

Does anyone have thoughts on this one?

Hey @PXSS if interested maybe we streamline this a little bit. Do you want to see if your contact will offer a better price for 10+ bought and ship to 2 destinations (happy to collect money for EU and pay if they want paypal addresses to match). I don't see a huge amount of difference between the chargers other than the external voltage adjustment possible with the one you found. If happy to work in this way then I am happy to help. Just need to make sure postage doesn't kill your price. The $32 for mine includes postage to 2 a US and UK address.

The external voltage adjustment is a must for me so regardless I'm sticking with this one.
I'm just offering others the chance to group buy as I think the voltage adjustment is very useful so that batteries dont sit fully charged or empty all the time.

I will see if they are willing to ship to 2 addresses but I really wanted to keep this as simple as possible.

And what about talking to them in including a current adjust pot if it's not too expensive, this way it would work well with smaller packs (10S2P)

Would it make sense to ship to single address and then split it? How hard is it to ship between countries and is it expensive? Would you care?

I'm guessing we could save some money if they shipped all of them to one address and then they were split instead of shipping 7 all to different addresses.

I don't think it's particularly difficult to ship stuff like this between countries. I think postage from UK would be in most cases about £8 or €9. If people are happy to cover the postage/packing cost then I can send them from here. Within the UK will probably be cheaper. More like £4-5. I think best bet would be for everyone to pay one person to order them all to 2 addresses then to pay for the onward postage to who ever does that.

I am not sure it's worth it. My understanding is that the postage to each address is USD10. If you divide it by 2 and pay after £5 to re-send it, you will arrive at something similar, plus the hassle of having to go and post it. For me it strarts to have an interest if you have 3-4 people in the same country, as the postage costs will be reasonable. If you start to send parcels within the EU, the costs will be higher.

There are some concerns on my side:
- how big is the knob? a flat but wide knob would be recommended to avoid accidental twist / damage. Alternative would be a sunk type potmeter. A thin-but-tall would be the worst on this small brick. What is the position of the knob? Is it user replaceable?
- what are the customs / tax fees importing into EU for the single address group buy? (?UK?) Even a single one is already above the tax-free limit if I'm right, with group buy to one address the pack could easily have tax+customs fees.
- what are the options for the power cord? - it looks like it's integrated so it's not just replacing the power cord...

I'm checking other options - even MW from local distributor could be an alternative if fees go high.

@PXSS @kovjanos

We are talking about getting each item shipped to individual addresses. I probably unlikely that it will be stopped but if so then VAT limit into the UK is £15 so there is potential for a charge. You would then be libel for 20% of value inc shipping. Duty doesn't apply on anything under £135 so nothing to worry about there. 

UK plug for me please (will there be any internal difference between US / UK / EU ones with the difference in voltage? Is this even required if it is being stepped down and regulated?

Looking forward to hear what they come back with.

No trying to talk you into it but no it wouldn't. VAT is 20% regardless. So lets say final price for the charger is £25 then VAT would be £5 and as @jga point out handling cost from Royal Mail (which is actually £8) so worst case scenario would be that you had paid £38 for a charger that you cant get in the UK for less than £40. 

As I have said this all depends on if it gets picked up.

for 22$ and free shipping in the usa you could charge at 400 watts with a safer regulated supply.

there is a potentiometer on these things and they're adjustable. the little knob is on the front left.  i have one that's rated at 48 and i can get it down to 9s
what's at the top of the thread is also a power supply with nothing to protect individual cells.  it just feeds a pack max voltage.  but with the linear supply, which is at the top of the thread, there's more of a risk of not being at the voltage you intended as the house ac supply voltage will vary and effect the output as well as the battery resistance,..from what I read. it's effectively a transfomer vs a switching supply (which i linked) which is more efficient and uses pwm (smaller lighter)

you need a voltmeter on either of these to be safe.  I add a watt meter in line that also shows voltage and amp hours through

I didn't tell anyone to get anything.
I said I am getting this from China, if anyone else wants to jump in go ahead.
I also stated that it was to be used with a BMS.

@TranxFu already made a good suggestion to people on a similar power supply above that I think is cheaper and actually has a spec sheet but doesnt go down low enough for 36V from what I see on the spec sheet.

Linear power supplies are used everywhere. Please link the article where it says it's more dangerous to use linear power supplies than switching.
They are not as efficient as switching power supplies yes but they have less ripple than switching ones.

Why do I need a wattmeter for or a coulomb counter?

i just post it up so people can see there's better options out there.

I dont have articles saying linear is less safe but from my looking into using them for charging lithium there are the variables i mentioned that will effect the output unlike a switching supply.

having a volt meter will tell what's going on.  turning the little adjustable knob will lead you into unknown territory otherwise.  having a volt meter on either is solution for either.

i use these basic power supplies to bulk charge my 12s without a bms.  you just have to monitor when charging.  it will shut off at the full voltage you set it to.  50.4 maybe.  you'll need to monitor individual cells still on the side and i do that with little 3 in 1 battery medic like devices.  to be clear these bulk chargers still shut off at the max voltage you set it to..and the pack will get there...but some of the cells might be imbalanced...but in my experience it's not a far spread and I balance every once in awhile just sticking the battery medic on the side

i dont know much about these things but just going with what I read about basic linear supplies:
http://www.neatcircuits.com/ensoniq/pswoes.htm

"Another aspect to consider is the mains power. Here in the U.S., the typical line voltage is 110 to 125 volts. It is amazing to see this number change from hour to hour, from day to day, and from season to season. I have seen the voltage as low as 95 volts and as high as 130 volts. Of course, the higher voltage is actually better for a failing power supply as long as heat isn't a problem. The higher input voltage overcomes the power supplies ability to regulate. If you had a weak power supply and the line voltage dipped below 105 volts, your ESQ1 could definitely start acting up. If you live in an area where the voltage is high or normal in the morning and you tested your ESQ1, you may not notice anything wrong. Let's say that during that summer evening with all the air conditioners running in your town you went to use the ESQ1, you could notice all kinds of problems with it. You're ESQ1 is a prime candidate for a power supply repair. I've seen traveling musical groups take along a voltmeter to monitor their voltage so they can eliminate mains power as their problem in troubleshooting their musical equipment problems."

maybe it has a "Devices that do this are called voltage regulators, voltage optimizers, voltage stabilizers, or voltage correctors"

http://www.explainthatstuff.com/voltage-optimisation.html

i just paste stuff figuring how it works but unless extra bits are added it seems the output voltage will vary with the input on a linear supply.  worth knowing especially if you plan to fully charge.   worth knowing whats going on anyway.

Yes, the line input from the wall varies day-to-day and hour-to-hour. But the regulator should still output consistent voltage. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the purpose of a voltage regulator?

EDIT: Where does it say this unit is a linear voltage regulator?  That article you linked is over a decade old with no citations. It talks about a technology that became mainstream in 1990 as if it's new.  I don't see how this charger could possibly have an efficiency as low as  50%.  That thing would be insanely hot if it had to dissipate that much heat

i think youre right and that link is an antique about antique stuff.   the deciding word is "regulated" or not it seems.  I'm now assuming this one in the groupbuy is regulated.  if it doesnt say these days it probably is maybe.  but maybe it will give a different output based on the input.  hoping to hear more from someone who could sum it all up..  or maybe it is summed up already.  please excuse my barging with the distraction, couldnt help myself.
 like this link https://www.teamwavelength.com/info/powersupply.php linear supplies are always regulated i think. this group buy is for linear.  "wall warts" that plug in the wall and power most electronics are not regulated and will give different voltage based on the load.

No, Linear supply can be unregulated or regulated.

So I'm curious what would happen if the charger voltage was set lower than the current battery voltage?  Wouldn't it discharge from the battery into the charger if no transistor was installed?  This would be convenient for discharging to storage voltage, but I doubt the charger was designed to dissipate that power.  The backflow of current could potentially damage the charger

That's fine. Voltage ratings are over the top. 

Three voltage ratings are called out in the test reports:
1. Breakdown Voltage: The failure voltage of the connector. 
2. DWV (75% of breakdown): The non-destructive voltage that the connector/cable should be tested at.
3. Working Voltage (1/3 of DWV): The maximum continuous voltage that the product should be used at.

As you can see, the voltage rating is really a quarter of what would damage it

Couldn't resist, looks pretty easy to mod and there is a lot of free space to add things like an arduino to make a charge level indicator

The shunt is really easy to identify and just need to replace with two of lower value and make one of them switchable

Any idea why this mess of resistir and what they could do in the circuit? Probably to increase the power dissipation

The battery is still charging and in the cc phase. Once you leave it in the cv stage for a while the difference will go away

Not really, charge to 4.2 and see what the drift is there.
No cell should exceed 4.25 ever.
If your cells are drifting it might be because you have bad weld/soldering too much.

Not really how that works.
There is no balance board. the drift is due to internal resistance differences, over time it will drift further and further.
The reasons behind lots drifting are bad cells, bad welding/soldering, discharging too low, charging too high.
Even the best cells will drift over time, having a charger that does cv charging will not remedy this ever unless you balance.

At 0.1V we are not talking about true drift though are we? It is just a slight charge difference that will go away once the pack is fully charged.

Ok so I charged and all of the parallel packs have balanced out with each other except one. 

Now I have 1 at 4.10v and the others at 4.06v-4.07v

This gap seems to be widening. I am guessing its times to open up the pack and take a look but I would have thought that if I had a dodgy connection then the voltage would have been lower after charging? Any ideas how I could manually bring this voltage down to the same as the others then try to discharge and recharge?

I still want to avoid an onboard BMS if possible. I have an imax B6 to use if this could be of help? I had thought of splitting the pack so that occasionally I could balance charge the 2 halves?

Any advice /opinions would be really appreciated @PXSS / @Maxid ?

Charging as two halves is a good idea and the reason why I have two 5S balance leads on my 10S pack.

What voltage did you charge your pack to and how long did you leave it connected?
Keep in mind that the CV phase will take some time as the current drops.

## \#214 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2017-04-18T11:56:55.399Z Reads: 139

There is a bad weld in that group. That would be my guess. The reason the voltage is higher is that the one cell has less capacity and therefore it charges faster than the others. When discharging, it'll be the opposite. Lower capacity means it'll discharge faster than the others so your voltage on the low end will be lower than the rest. 

I recommend getting a BMS. If you don't want one then use a hobby charger to balance.
When discharging there is nothing to protect your cells from going out of balance and having one go below 2.5V. That is the advantage of having a BMS. If that were to happen then the BMS would cut power and protect your battery whereas now, if that happened it would cause damage to your battery

Ok thanks both. I'm going to keep my eye out. Ill have a look at that group and see if I can find the bad weld. Once that is fixed is there anything I can do to bring that group down to match the others? eg wire something in to just that group? Also I am assuming that the pack would need to be split into 2 5s packs while balancing using an iMax B6 as this will only balance up to 6 or 8s I think.

What you could try is splitting the battery and doing a discharge test on your B6.
Both packs should have similar capacity you can get out. If not then you know that the one cell should be replaced/reworked.

Have you checked to see if your charger actually does 5A?

On my 12S version, it can only do 4A max, despite being labeled as 5A. The 10S one may be different

That said... I love mine. 4A is plenty fast for me. Haven't had any problems with reliability and I don't know how I could survive without the adjustable end of charge voltage

Bit of a problem, but totally my fault I knew that the plug of the charger was 2.5mm but was using a 2.1mm on the board, yesterday the connector melted due to poor contact, not to the point of shorting, but enough to burn my finger. That was dumb, but laziness spoke louder since the 2.1mm ones was waterproof, luckily I found one that fits the waterproof seal and is 2.5mm, just need to replace

And also replaced the fan, quieter than the original even before it went bad and apparently has a higher flow, hopefully the charger will run cooler, i always though it got a bit to hot

This would destroy your battery. Cells in parallel self balance so you do not need to keep them in check. You charge individual cells to 4.2v and not 42v if you want to charge them through the balance leads. Yes the connector to the bms is called the balancing connector lol. 

If you actually meant that you are going to build your battery as six 10s batteries and then put them together in parallel. I strongly recommend you reconsider. The amount of wiring and extra work is not negligible. You essentially have to build 6 batteries with 2 main leads and 11 balancing wires and then make a harness for your 66 balancing wires and 12 main leads to connect them in parallel. The only reason you would want to do this is if you wanted to monitor each individual cell and replace them individually instead of as a p group when they go bad which you shouldn't do anyway because you're not supposed to mix new and old cells either.

Just fyi. No home made battery is airline safe and it should not be taken onboard an airplane regardless of the energy. For any battery to be anywhere close to airline safe or shippable world wide you have to go through dot inspection which is extremely expensive and rigorous.
