Stock in detail: 
2x vescs SOLD
2x mounts with hardware SOLD
2x 6355 SENSORED motors AVAILABLE

Further details
VESCS: from maytech; factory suggests not to use FOC although many people use it. On these batch c18 and c26 were added (capacitors that reduce the chance of FOC failure)
MOTORS:
170kv (you can run them 12s flawlessly); water/dust proof cover; I paid additional price to have sensors added for a smooth startup; 18mm keyway+ free keys.
MOUNTS: fixed price 25â‚¬

I am selling this stuff to fill my wallet a bit before spending 300+ on vesc 6.

Will post more pictures if requested.

Where are you? Last time I shipped mounts it was about 6â‚¬ untracked or 10â‚¬tracked . No one reported a lost shipping so I believe you are good with the untracked.
Sorry didnt read. Let me check for the us.

EDIT: 11â‚¬ to USA (they raised the price since december?!)

Where were you able to find these motors Un-sensored ??,.. I want unsensored

Maytech only have these sensored on their website?

You can also run a sensored motor as unsensored. You can find maytech on alibaba and ask the price for one piece.
I asked them to add sensor just because it is one added value and because you can start from standstill as if you rode a boostedboard.

Hi guys I have a question (please be sincereðŸ˜ƒ): how much do you think these motors are worth?
Brand new (not even bench tested); keyway and keys included, dirtproof cover; sensors.

Really?! Enertion was selling a cheaper version (no sensors, no sealing) for 130usd. Obviously I am not aiming that high but something around the 100 should be fair.

Those motors do look very good, I'd say around 90 on a shop, in a group buy you would find them around 75â‚¬

I really doubt you will find new sensored maytechs at 75â‚¬. Anyways my promise doesn't changeðŸ˜‰. I will give you 5â‚¬ off on the lowest price you can find in Europe.
Plus if you buy them both there are 2 aluminum pulleys and 4 belts for free.

What brand are the group buy's motors? They seem to be pretty good in every aspect, and they're sensored as well

Motors from group buy are from this factory/reseller: https://m.alibaba.com/product/60566699948/6354-Kv230-brushless-outrunner-hall-sensor.html
It is easy to understand that if factory price was 36$ I wouldn't even try to sell them at 100 haha.

Mine are from maytech instead https://m.alibaba.com/product/60552516222/Maytech-Electric-Drip-proof-6355-Motor.html?spm=a2706.7843299.1998817009.5.uicvrP
I am asking about 95/100 for them and it seems very fair to me. Anyways I could even sell them for 70â‚¬ if somebody else sells them for 75â‚¬.ðŸ˜„

Aren't the group buy ones more sealed? They seem a bit too open. By the way, the group buy still has the lowest prices out there, I can only imagine how much profit there's going on with motors (enertion's big boy without sensors for 130 or more made me laugh a lot) 
Anyway, it's the first time I see these maytechs but they seem great, perfect for a waterproof build. If I hadn't already ordered another motor I'd give yours a go, maybe next time! Seeing that factory price, raise yours without fear. It's just that shops can have way higher prices, while privates should lower them to be more competitive. People prefer to spend 20 dollars more but get the warranty of a shop. You could probably find a good market for these motors if you started importing them in Europe.

As the title says it's just a personal stock clearance. So for now I am just leaving the offer here.

BTW the factory I linked has tons of models and I picked the wrong one. Have a look a these instead: https://m.alibaba.com/product/60500339401/HOT-SALE-MP6374-Kv170-RC-outrunner.html?spm=a2706.7843667.1998817009.22.tLSNzI

Please pm me if you want me to look for others vendors factoriesðŸ˜„. Such motors are not maytech, but still have a good reputation here on the forum.

To remind what the thread is all about: 
I am selling 2 brand new maytech 6355 sensored with keyway. 
The price is the lowest you can find in Europe (send me a link) with a further 5â‚¬ discount. If you buy 2 I'll send 2 aluminum pulleys and 4 belts for free (all brand new).
