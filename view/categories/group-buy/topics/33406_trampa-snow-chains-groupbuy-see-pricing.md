Hey guys, last year I posted my snow chains and I got a lot of interest in them.  I'm willing to release a group buy for them in where I make no money, just enough to break even. 
These chains are made for 8" wheels from Trampa. I use them on the standard Primo wheels and they fit just fine. They include a mesh bag. 
Im in contact with my guy who makes them for bulk pricing.

$170 a set for 1-5
$140 a set for 6-10
$120 a set for 11 and up

List your name if you would be interested in a set of 4 chains

Same same, I can do a set as well. You can ship mine along with @Mikeomania12 and @flywithgriff if they're gonna buy since we live in the same area.

Maybe @DucatiGuy is interested as well?

Aren't they 6 inch wheels? 

If you send me a wheel I can get them made. I would guess same price

They are, but they're square-ish and wider than the trampa wheels. My hope was that the extra width would make up for the smaller diameter.

That sounds interesting, i was thinking to spike a set of tyres for the winter, but MTB tyres are so thin.
Any info on how chains perform? How long they last?

I don't have any numbers but there is a significant difference when riding with and without chains. 

I've put 60 miles on them last winter and the only thing you need to do it lock tight the locking thread. Other than that it's fine

I'm also in. But perhaps we could wait a few more weeks to see if anyone else is keen ti get snowchains.?

@barajabali any possibillity you could ship the chains as a "gift" to me? To avoid 25% tax on them.. Or are they shipping directly from factory?
