I'm interested, do you have a working prototype? What's it made of? Looks like you use your thumb to scroll on the wheel, which is my favourite way to go. Does winding back simply just brake or will it reverse as well or is that something I can change/adjust myself with some software changes?

Edit: forgot to ask, just how small is it? I like small, but I do want something I can comfortably hold.

Yes, i have been testing this for a while.... Its made using an injection mold, it is glossy black plastic. It is thumb controlled, forward & backwards, no scrolling...

it has a built-in trimming pot, or you can adjust using vesc.

Nice. What I meant by scrolling is basically moving forwards and backwards. So do you mean it can reverse the board or simply brakes and stops?

I would suggest doing a group buy, that way you can get free shipping & also save a percentage...

If you buy just one it will not be a good deal... My website cannot easily calculate the freight from Belgium to your address because it thinks the parts will ship from the Australian warehouse...

I hope that makes sense, eventually our system will be setup better, but it's a slow transition phase.

Right, but with the steez remote, two boards riding close would have drop outs, unless you switched the channels on one of the remotes. With steez, there was process to switch (press A button 10x in 10 seconds, etc) between like 5-6 different channels. I've not heard of the Nano having the same ability to switch channels.

Does anyone know who the Belgium distributor is?

@onloop  I would really like to know if this remote resolves the drop out issue that most controllers are experiencing where it causes the motors to slam on the brakes. Making remotes smaller is great and all, but at this point I think we all just want a remote that is safe and reliable. I don't feel like dying because my eboard decides to slam on it's brakes at an inopportune moment.

the electronics. Ergonomically they're very similar, but i think he's doing something to customize the electronics. If i had to guess i'd say channel changing and pairing behavior, but that's purely speculation based on my own experiences with Winning remotes, which so far, hasn't been the best experience.

True. I was only doing about 10mph when it streeted my face. IT was as if the hand of Skatan himself reached up from below to smite my board.  But I can't imagine this is just a Winning in sheep's clothing. I feel confident that some things inside were adjusted to get rid of the bad behavior, otherwise The NANO-X would be doomed from the get go, and already having had a pile of Winning's to experiment with i feel like Jason is aware of its faults and knew what needed to change.

After all these bad reports about the Winning remote it would be cheeky to just put their electronics in a (better) case and sell it. I know that there are also many riders happy with the Winning but it´s definitely not a well-engineered product.

I also used the winning for about 150 km with no problems (except the sensitiveness and the sticking thumb button) and did not apply any changes to my setup before it dropped me of, that´s why it´s very hard to figure out if, when and why it happens. But as we all know every single failure can cause very serious injuries and as an esk8 company you have to make damn sure that your products are working well.

During early testing i realised i could improve the thumbstick design to ensure a smoother motion back & forth and also to prevent the thumbstick from being compressed down into the case when force is applied.

now i have implemented a post & rail system to ensure smooth motion.

@onloop It's due to users falling on their a$$ or face for reasons not related to stupidity in their part.

Like I mentioned multiple times, I've had disconnections while trying to brake. If you were approaching a red light at just 10mph and you have no brakes, you may be able to walk away unscathed, but the board might keep going into traffic. Or in some cases it brakes when you didn't expect it and throws the user into traffic,

This means many of us Winning remote users are not truly enjoying the DIY, but going slow...might as well have all gotten the Ego.

I do appreciate the update, you really should've just said new firmware and board to begin with

## \#71 Posted by: Mrmoonlight Posted at: 2016-09-13T12:49:57.690Z Reads: 378

It's mainly a backup if your brakes stop working due to a dropped connection. If you're going 18mph on a belt drive and release your throttle, you will be down to 12mph on flats pretty quickly. So you can employ your footbrake then if your remote fails. 

Any remote can lose connection, so we shouldn't be 100% relying on them to stop us anyways. Obviously a remote that doesn't ever drop connection is better and safer, but the fear of a drop connection shouldn't be what stops you from going faster than an EGO. I push faster than my EGO.

Any updates yet? It said stock arrives after Sept 20, and for me in Australia, it's almost the 21st. Are there any more pictures? Or any videos of it in action lately? @onloop replied a week ago, but we haven't seen the full finished product yet.

[/quote]

We made some last minute changes that required parts of the mold to be modified & my china factory went on holidays for 4 days, so sadly we are behind schedule.

I hope everyone is happy to wait for a better product?

ALSO, due to some doubt surfacing in the community about the reliability I have decided to do a public beta test process before shipping the orders, I will be sending a few of the final prototypes out to people who can test it in a unique environment. Hopefully ill get these out early next week. Ill be sending one to @Michaelinvegas and a few other senior esk8 members, only after they confirm the product is ok will i ship the orders.

Yeah, I'm still really unsure about pre ordering, I really love the design and the fact that it's a thumb wheel sort of remote, but I'm not sure about how reliable it is, after what happened to the winning remote. On the other hand, if I pre order now, I get it for a pretty nice price. Hopefully the beta testers will come out with reviews before the sale ends.

Well, it is very important to get a reliable remote. Therefore i can understand your fear.

**but** onloop has delayed the current orders to make a beta test. If the beta test fails i dont think he will just sells the broken products.... why should he make a beta test when he does not care about the result.

That being that i highly assume that if there is any mayor problem like reliablity or so he will delay the preorders **again** and make sure that everything is okay! So you dont need to worry to get a reliable product with this preorder!

My 2 cents.

I guess so. He mentioned that some of the 'senior esk8 members' will get the beta, so I expect people like longhairedboy and probably some mods to give an honest review about whether the product should be sold or not. I think I'll go with it, since I haven't really seen a remote like it yet in the market, and it's exactly what I'm looking for.

here is some footage of the new NANO-X controller in use, this controller has an automatic binding function which makes setup easy & the range seems very good, however we don't have much radio interference at my house.

the firmware probably still needs some tweaking as it appears the brake is a bit too aggressive... of course, you can make changes in the vesc too to fix that. However, I think it's better to perfect this in the hand controller firmware as much as possible. Everyone is different & has different expectations so at the end of the day you might just rely on the vesc for fine tuning.

Still waiting on the beta units, they will arrive at Enertion HQ soon, then ill send them out to the selected forum members for their feedback.

Overall I am very excited about this, it feels nice in the hand, very compact without feeling too hard or uncomfortable to hold.

you can see in this photo one of the major changes we had to make with the mold, this gives the thumb-piece a track to move back & forth on, it also prevents it falling out, it will resolve many issues and make the throttle feel much more solid under thumb.

this delayed production around 2 weeks, but definitely worth it.

I want to order this, but like some of the guys are saying,
without user feedback that its bullet proof, I have to go with the original Wii
remote. I use this to get to and from work in London and to be honest, when I’m
on the way to work in my suit, I could do without my face or suit (as in suit
and tie) getting ripped. Ending up under a car or bus because the remote didn’t
respond, is not an option! If it proves to be good ill, consider ordering one.
That said, the price is also a sticking point, having to pay almost half the
items original purchase price as postage and then the likelihood that an import
charge will be charged on top is, is not an easy pill to swallow. I’m also one
of the original backers i.e. first 100 and I feel entitled in being offered far
more reduced price. I remember getting an email not too long ago saying that
the first 150 members will get gold status and get early access to new items and
reduced prices, I’m yet to see that. Anyway, I digress, if it proves to work
ill invest, but for now with the price at £40 plus shipping, its then £57 and
then import taxes, it’s going to be around £75.So, for now, no thanks.

This may be a weird question, but does anyone know if the NANO-X would work with an Evolve Bamboo GT? 

I have a Raptor on the way, but my wife has a Bamboo GT and the remote scares the shit out of me lol. I took a pretty significant tumble due to the finger trigger and really don't feel comfortable with it. We "grew up" with a Benchwheel remote on my first board, so the thumb throttle/brake is much more natural for us.

"never buying anything from [Enertion] ever again" is taking it a little too far.

The fact that we are putting together DIYs means there are inherent risks as we are the guinea pigs for these small companies. Jason is one man, his team is small and they can only test so much. That's the reason why we are on this forum figuring things out. The Steez AND Winning were existing remotes that various company uses. As Enertion progress, they will have the means to improve (as he has with batteries, deck, mounts, etc.) The Nano-X may be our answer.

We have sent out an update email today, maybe you have used an invalid email on your orders?

Anyway, there are some beta units in transit to me now. They will get express shipped to some folks for testing. This test is mostly to check the safety & signal quality and give some general feedback about how well the remote works.

ALSO, some news about the NEW PCB design, I didn't mention it before because i wasn't sure we would get it working properly, we are going forward with the reverse button feature!! (small buytton above the "e")

This means you can switch reverse on at the hand controller. This is a new feature and will need to be checked out a bit more. but looks promising so will probably make it to the final version.

The other feature we are trying to get is an on/off switch for the 2 channel. for lights etc.

I'm pretty confident. The product works perfectly in my area. But that has proven to be a bad benchmark for testing in the past as I'm not in a congested city with rf pollution. So I think for safety purpose we need it to be tested by others. 

Within one one week it would be nice to have some feedback. 

Production is approx 3 weeks.

Shipping to end user 1-2 weeks.

I'll be testing the remote as soon as I get it.  I do have the Winning remote as well.  There is a place here that gets a strange interference for a few moments and I can re-create the drop out issue at times if I hold the remote above my head.

Cool might aswell order a VESC-X, working on a project for a company. They like the idea but dont think a skateboard can have an impact at the commuting. But considering the price of your normal vesc (€80,-) and the vesc-x (€150,-) its very likely to go for the standard one though.

So matte finish is way better in the long run.

glad to see there are no dropouts in the usual places... that is fantastic news!

ALSO: there is no trim pot on this PCB so need to do it in ESC settings. 
the button you can see is reverse function, hold it down for 3 seconds to activate reverse, the final version will have a button that can be pressed with your finger instead of a tool.

_(note sure if this beta actually has reverse activated in firmware as i didn't test it before sending)_

Hmmm interesting design choice of no physical trim pot. Trade offs with only SW configurable, and tied to vesc. Not sure worth eliminating physical instead of allowing both...surely cant be much cost savings?

Tell you the truth I didn't ...but the main point of this was to see if I could drop the signal.  Which it didn't.

I will be honest...I don't like thumb remotes at all.  But for the sake of testing I used it.

I talked with @Jinra and I'll be sending the remote out to him to test ...and after we agreed @evoheyax will get it .... 

It's a new game we have called pass the NANO-X....

Lots of esk8 in San Fran so pass it around the SF community guys and then have someone shoot it to some other state or something...let keep tabs on the NanoX and put it through real paces together and provide feedback so we keep getting better products from our beloved ESk8 Vendors

OK.  So I just got an update about your "slow speed"

This is actually an additional features that made it into the beta firmware.

The nano-x  has a "beginner" and "advanced" mode.

You can flick the switch (near the throttle) and it puts a limit on the throttle.

I suggest trying the remote again with the switch in the opposite position and you should now see full range and acceleration.

Ok FUCK YEAH Now we are talking


A VAST improvement...


Yep...click up on the switch for beginner mode

Click down on the switch for normal ...

Made me like it even more ....(but still don't like thumb throttles) lol

Pretty bad ass feature .... you can hand your remote to your friends and just click that switch and ....they don't know they are in beginner mode ...

Ramping is pretty awesome on beginner ... nice a smooth...and in pro mode...Watch out...throttle comes alive 

Well done sir

Three things learned from JASON at ENERTIONBOARDS.com

1. NO trim pot to adjust throttle & brake
2. The recessed button on this BETA NANO-X remote is for reverse. The BETA button has a deeply recessed button. The commercial version will have a button you will be able to press with your finger.
3. The switch below the throttle is for beginner and expert mode. Click the switch up and it's in beginner mode. Click the button down and it's in EXPERT MODE.

Screw it...just watch the video 🎥

 we should send it to one more test person and then start the production. I think its has been 2 months since i ordered the remote and i'll gladly wait another few weeks but if we keep delaying production, it i'll be winter when it arrives here in belgium! I'm happy that the finish will be changed (i voted for matte to) and that everything works good! 

And @Michaelinvegas in one of your other vids you said you maybe would make a video about the binding procedure. I'd really apprecieate that if you'd do that!

I'll get @hummie to try it out. I love thumb controlled remotes, so it might be just what I need :P

I get the whole "this was made by enertion thing", but I personally don't like the branding on the remote. It eliminates this remote as an option for my complete boards when I finally get them built and on the market.

My impressions:

A. Gloss finish lends it self to too many finger prints...and scratches ...then looks crappy 

~ silicone sleeve? Flat finish?

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/7/6740954a2f109ac68fc0bb34fd62436e913cf6ce.JPG" width="666" height="500">

B. Bigger throttle = Better throttle feel, but shape of actual throttle where you touch it is actually two tiny pointed ridges...need a larger contact point for more positive traction 

~ rounder? dimple? Flat? angled? 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/291a1c9674814f41ba2383ab2d2baa3de9bdbeb9.JPG" width="326" height="245">

C. Bottom grip where your fingers curl have a strong edge and slightly dig into the joints of your fingers.

~ molded finger grip on all four fingers? more rounded edge? 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/6/96c89412620843dff9185e09b96e578b10a712b8.JPG" width="375" height="500">

D. It's light!

~ maybe too light? 

E. Nice ramping of throttle in beginner mode (really should be intermediate mode - you can still street your face) 

~ maybe breaking should maybe left alone since it drastically effects stopping distance while in beginner mode

F. Black is alway cool 😎 but it still looks like the bottom of a gun or a small pistol

~ maybe bright colors? stick on skins?

Suggestions/ideas

1. Bigger LED indicators 
2. Make a brass knuckle grip to reduce the chances of dropping and it looks cool 
3. Add Picatinny rail to the top of the remote so people can add light easily or some other attachment system
4. Make it a frosted clear and have it lighted

.....

That's my two and a half cents

My point is simple: that the remote seems good, but due to the branding on the remote, I can't use them to sell with complete boards. I were to buy them in bulk, it would be from enertion. Just saying it's lost business for you. But like I said, it's your product, so it's your right to brand them, No hard feelings or anything. I wish there was a way to have them made without the branding ;)

How can you wire the receiver into your esc? Are you required to have a specific setup? It looks like the receiver comes with a very specific 6-pin port? How did you wire it to your board with the beta version? Any answer would be much appreciated, I have a Benchwheel board that I kinda messed up the receiver on and was wondering if I could wire in this receiver and use this remote.
Thanks!

So this is the connector from the pevious receiver and where it connects to the motherboard. Would I be able to connect this receiver to it somehow? And also what does the RX, and TX mean? Obviously the positive and negative are to supply power correct?

that is absolutely correct. You will boost overall performance of the remote by as much as 20% by painting it red. A deeper, richer red should also further reduce frequency interference while a brighter red would increase signal strength, so make sure you have the appropriate shade for the situation.

It's comparable to the mini remote...but you use your thumb and for some that takes getting use to.

Plus it has the beginner mode feature which is super nice...kinda good for sidwalk riding to keep the ride tame. And it's a better feel in the hand cause it's a little fatter where you hold it.

It's def an alternative

So, I received my Nano-X today - thanks very much.

The instruction are very basic,almost next to unusable. Maybe someone can help me out.

* On the receiver which end is the -ve terminals? The receiver or the instructions does not indicate this. Hopefully there is reverse polarity protection on the receiver. 

* The beginner mode, is this turned on when the switch is up or down? The Transmitter or the instructions does not indicate this.

* How is the bind terminal used? The instructions do not explain this.

* What is Throttle mirror mode? The instructions do not explain this.

* How does the channel 2 switch work? Is it momentary, or does it toggle? What is the rang of the output, does it drive a servo from fully CW to fully CCW, or visa-vera, or something else?

Cheers,

Peter

the controller auto binds, ill need to check what the manual procedure is.

throttle mirror modes makes the direction of brake/throttle swap. usefull if you connect your motor wires the wrong way

channel 2 requires a electronic siwtch to be connect to CH2, most RC car light kits come with it.

Got it. strange, I connected it up as per the above and it wouldn't bind, swapped it over so the same orientation as the gt2b - it bound - but wouldn't control.
Swapped the orientation over and it works, so mirrored to the gt2b it controls, Bound the same was as the gt2b controls the other way.
What does beginner mode actually do? Limit the ppm?

Although one thing.
When you say it's a plug and play operation, make sure it is one, cause i bought an Enertion vesc to go with the controller, but neither come with a servo cable.

Just received my NANO-X controller earlier today. After first inspection, I liked its ergonomic design, size and general feel. 

HOWEVER, is it just me who finds that the throttle stick is not as smooth as they anticipated? Also, when I press together (without much force) on the side where the beginner mode settings are, it produces a squeaky/snappy noise, is this normal?

Let me know if you guys have noticed any similarities and whether I should try and ignore it or request a replacement etc.

Can't be that difficult! You actually don't have to bind it. Get a 3-wire cable and a connector that fits in the receiver slot. The setup is exactly the same as with the HobbyKing GT2E receiver, but instead of plugging into channel 2 you plug that cable into channel 1. 

There are heaps of posts in this forum where you can learn how to connect the 3-wire cable to the VESC (GND, positive and signal). That's it no rocket science.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/3/73a8223587729faa1c0c34c5778aac57cdbb3701.jpg" width="586" height="500">

I was thinking to measure the voltage across the red (GND) and orange (+) cable at the receiver. Just unplug the cables and test the voltage with a multimeter. I have attached a picture of my receiver. You can clearly see how the 3 connectors are aligned up (all vertical). I assume if your pin rows are aligned horizontally then the PCB must be rotated. At least you can check if yours look the same.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/b/1b583e542299e54a34bdb3df902bcb13cc2285d6.jpg" width="690" height="375">

My Nano-X just arrived today (UK order here and I pre-ordered at the end or August). 

I love this finish and feel of the remote and I'm looking forward to testing it out. I am going to be VERY careful with testing as I tried the Wining remote and I had to throw it away as it was WAY to dangerous to use (threw me off my eMTB a number of times)

Is it possible to mod the RX so I can add an aerial? I'm so worried about reliability, I just want to make sure that I get no drop outs or very jittery controls like I did with the Wining remote that this looks to be based on.

Hey I just receive my remote !!
I'm so happy, when I tried to plug the VSC in it ( I tried both ways), my moto keep beeping. 
Normally it's because the throttle position is not on 0. 
So I disconnected my RX, connected to the VSC a servo tester ( to see if the brushless moto is working ( yes it works perfectly) . And then without turning off my board I plug the RX in the Vesc. 
My motor start spinning at mid regime, and when I put the throttle down  is slow it down ( but still spinning fast)  . ANd then when I go full throttle it accelerate just a bit... 
Kind of unsafe, and if I turn it on/off again it wontworks :( . 

Any idea guys?

hey folks, hope it's not off topic but my good old DIY carbon custom enclosure GT2B is still alive... but I would like to give this one a try ! I really like the shape and the mindset behind the design of it. I'm wondering, has the receiver being designed from scratch or is this "only" an enclosure which existing "steez" material? 

I really like the bulletproof signal of the GT2B and I don't want to sacrifice any security on this! take care folks and happy xmas riding.

First of all I would like to say, that this remote is amazing! The only downside i could think off is the binding process. In order for mine to work I needed to connect the wire vertical at first (rightest pins, signal wire facing upwards), then I had to switch of the esc and connect the reciever to channel 1. Now it works flawlessly.

Just wanted to give a shout out to Jason @onloop for coming through on his promise to hook up  to recent raptor 1 owners with the new remote. Got mine today.  Did a small range test and I got at least 10 times the range including sheet rock walls in between with 0 drop out. I still don't know the limit of this thing. 

Excellent customer service!

I prefer the old style physically (the new remote is large on the lower fingers) but the reliability is a huge improvement. Never had issues with the old one but standing 4 ft away I've had drop outs when testing the range. The new one you could crash and be safe to kill throttle as it rolls away.

Good r&d and listening to the customers.  Big thumbs up!

@fraannk I also tried to place an order for USA but shipping was also US$ 45 so I stopped there.

I really hope Enertion start to keep stock in their USA warehouse, it's would be so much easier to buy things from them without high shipping costs from AUS, I had to buy several parts from alternative vendors, even though I like Enertion stuff the most, just because of this.

**Shipping errors and duplicates**

It has come to our attention that many orders for nano-x  (and various other parts from each order that had nano-x) may have been sent out as a duplicate.

We will be emailing each person about this asking for you to return any extra stock you received.

This matter is preventing us from fulfilling other older orders as there is no stock available.

Check your signal wire. If this has an issue (e.g. partially loose connection) it won't work. Took me a while to figure this out. If not successful, try to remove the signal line and just power up the receiver with GND and +5V! (You need no signal line to get a connection between receiver and transmitter).

And you may also follow the other claim to remove the sticky tape on the back of the circuit board. Open NANO-x receiver and remove PCB. I personally don't believe this claim but check it out anyway!

the one I got last month has very good connection, no conflicts with frequencies used for speed cameras etc here in london as I had at least slightly with other remotes. the nano-x never lost signal. I'm satisfied.
I never fully discharged it and I don't know if it has a low battery signal like the SMTBoard one (the power led flashes on that one when you turn it on and the battery is low) but so far so good.

I've finally got to use mine and its great.  No signal issue at all.  I like the beginner mode.

My only feedback to @onloop for future changes would be as follows:

Switches labelled on/off and what they do.
Maybe a slighly bigger hole for the wrist strap to allow you to use a different strap more easily.  
A less on/off throttle level.  I think this maybe possible to fix in BLDC though?

I love the size and feel in the hand.
