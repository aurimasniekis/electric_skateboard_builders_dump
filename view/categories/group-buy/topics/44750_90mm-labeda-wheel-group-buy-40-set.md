Just got off the phone with Labeda. I'm going to be ordering a small sample stock of 90mm Labeda wheels with the Plush formula to distribute to reviewers and to sell in limited quantities. To get things off the ground, I want to kickstart a small group buy for these 90mm Labedas.

How's 40 USD per set + shipping? Needless to say, that pricing is not sustainable for any company, so you won't see this pricing here for a long time after this group buy.

If you're interested, PM me so then I can put your info into a spreadsheet. PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. It makes my life easier so then I can organize distribution.

**BIG EDIT:** @JLabs is also arranging for center mount 36T 15mm Kegel pulleys for $24 each. He'll be shipping some time after March, once China frees up its factories from the Lunar New year.


https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gQZB47pJOED1Yrmj3iK4I44vuZb5mlVdwwKICtVPWf4/edit?usp=sharing

**OKAY SO HERE'S THE UPDATE:** So for starters, Labeda has told me they can do **Black wheels with a white core**. That's the only color choice we have for the 'small run'. This color choice is **final** since this is literally a piggyback order that Labeda is only able to do once.

For this 'small run', I'm told that I will have to order a minimum of 160 sets of wheels. Obviously that's still a lot. So to decrease the amount of units we need to reserve for this group buy, I started another poll for whether or not we should increase the group buy price by $5. Doing that will mean we only need to reserve 100 units for the group buy to happen. However this is a community matter, so I'm leaving it to a vote.

For estore owners looking to get their hands on these wheels to sell, PM me, so then we can negotiate 'whole sale pricing' that won't completely screw my wallet.

I'm going to leave this color poll open for future reference. However for this first run, the color choice has already been locked in for the above stated reasons:

[poll type=regular public=true]
* Red
* White
* Blue
* Black
* Gray
* Green
* Purple
* Yellow
* Orange
* Brown

Any indication regarding the quality of those wheels ? Compared to Kegels, MBS all terrain, Flywheel clones...

Same thing as the Ollin Popocas and Enertion R Spec GHOST wheels. These have a wider contact patch versus 97mm flywheels. For heavy carving, these are about as good as it gets for wheels.

Got it. I'm trying to get an idea of how those would be good, I don't have a lot of knowledge regarding wheels. The only thing I know is that the Abec11 are considered the best out there.

I went on their website and I can't even find any skateboard wheels, am I missing something ? :thinking: http://labeda.com/products-category/wheels/

Yeah... their website isn't laid out the best. I guess perhaps skateboarding is an even smaller market than what we imagine. Labeda is the company that also manufactures those orange 80mm Kegels that everyone seems to have.

Interesting. So the wheels you want to order would probably have the same core as the Kegels.
Do you think you could get a picture of them ?

unfortunately I can't get a pic of them until they're actually casted by the Labeda. If you want an idea of what they look like, the Ollin Popocas are pretty much the same thing sans the white engravings.

I'd have to do my research for that. However since Labeda wheels are all casted in the US, shipping should pretty much cost the same regardless of whoever you get these Labedas from.

## \#14 Posted by: PredatorBoards Posted at: 2018-01-27T02:20:45.629Z Reads: 398

Kegels cores. I'm waiting to hear back from their turnaround time. Since it's a dynamic ordeal that they have to time with the other products they cast. Roughly 78A Duro with their 'Plush Formula'. They also have a race formula that wears slightly better, but might as well get them plushies.

I have to add, if you don't specify how any sets you want to order, I'm going to assume just 1. Don't be afraid of asking for a specific amount :money_mouth_face:. I'll change the spreadsheet or remove your order entirely if your financial situation changes.

Comes in a full set of 4 wheels. Yep fits a boosted board with the stock pulleys. However you'll need to remove or grind the motor guard.

Not gonna lie. I'm really on the edge of saying fuck ya'll and doing wheels with Pantone 298C 'thane and an Orangatang Orange core. Something like this but with a kegel core:

That or maybe a color scheme simmilar to the Volante Seretas

I'm designated **Muthafukin' Tiffany as the Blue thane and Orange core option.** If you want that color scheme, go ahead and vote for it. Still thinking about waving the fat veto and going ahead with blue and orange wheels regardless. It'd be easier and faster for me to rush these wheels to Amazon Prime if that's the case....

I can get the price down to $24usd per pulley for 30pcs. I can buy 10 of those so 20 would have to be pre ordered. 

I’m assuming everyone is set on 36T 15mm? Anodized black for maximum stealthiness of course :wink:

If you interested maybe we could add another column to the google sheet. With the Chinese Holiday earliest delivery would be mid/late March

And is it possible to buy just the pulleys without wheels :stuck_out_tongue: ?

They are aluminum.. no modifications required and fit caliber 2’s. 

I will probably need someone with a Popoca or Enertion wheel to send me one to make sure the Pulley fits 100% perfect, as it’s slightly different than Kegels. 

I guess you can get a Pulley without the wheels. Just PM me at a later time when this actually goes through

I voted black but to be honest always liked the look of purple Kegels. Maybe a black thane and orange core? Purple with orange core would be my best set if I could make that decision ;)

That's why I'm heavily thinking about going teal 'thane and orange core wheels. I think the color scheme looks great on top of being marketable to not just the esk8 market but the entire longboarding genre. I'm looking at these wheels as the first 'bridge' between esk8 and longboarding. I know for a fact Downhill longboarders will love this compared to their 80mm Kegels....

For now we're locked in for 90mm. I don't believe Labeda has mass production molds for 97mm and 100mm wheels yet. They only have small batch prototype molds. I can ask to see what kind of small production run we can do in the future.

Yep! Basically 90mm kegels but with the plush formula that is offered by Labeda. I went into length with Labeda about the disparities between the Plush Formula and the Race Formula, and the guy was like 'it won't matter too much' at the speeds we're going. In that case I opted for the plush formula for making low speed riding just a hair better than usual.

Last I checked, he's not selling his ESCs anymore to the DIY community. He has stated on instagram they're still on the fence about continuing again...but it'll be several months before a final decision is made. Otherwise, he is continuing to sell spare parts that work with his completes, for replacement purposes.

I doubt he will take the Popoca wheels off of his store front...his wheel pulleys are built for kegel cores and they still haven't adapted an abec core pulley for their V2 mounts yet...so taking those wheels off means any customers wishing to get replacement wheels are stuck with 80mm kegels...

Right now I'm split between 2 choices. Colors or black on black. Some members made a good point though that it would be wise (and just respectful) to avoid doing another all black wheel since Chaka already sells those wheels as an entirely separate venture. On the other hand I'm doing this group buy 'for fun' since I was curious about the economics of the costs behind manufacturing American made wheels. I'd be willing to lose a handful of participants in the group buy if it means giving Chaka some well deserved business for his wheels.

Maybe the solution is to just pick two colors and go with that. One black and one what ever the majority is. If the price goes up for the other color then that’s just what you guys have to pay. If Labeda only allows one color just order the black and have someone else get a sample order for the other color..

Labeda is willing work with me under the circumstances that my company remains a client for future endeavors. Splitting the run into multiple batches is a lot harder than you'd think. They're a manufacturer equipped to do much larger runs at a time. They would have to start 2 processes at a time with 2 different hot-pours of urethane. I'm trying to see if they're willing to do 2 runs but it seems to be a slim shot.

There's an equal amount of people who demanded black as there are not-black. I wouldn't consider different colors just because I felt like it.

There are already black wheels on the market from Ollin and Enertion that European people can get if they don’t want a color. To me black is boring with my board that I am doing I would be fine with 2 colors and would both would work Green or Purple would be a great color and would not show up the wear as much as white. Green would make it like a flywheel but with the level core.

Woo boy, so l finished talking with Labeda and here's what I got. Basically we exceeded Labeda's small manufacture threshold by quite a margin, which means I need to limit the group buy (we're talking perhaps 20-30 sets MAX) or double down and order 250 sets (yikes).

The owner is trying to see if he can work something out for us. He's checking to see if there's any available 'plush' formula urethane from other production runs from other clients. However if we go that route, then we can't be picky with our color choices. The good news however is that we can order a larger amount sets in the group buy.

Say this doesn't work out... If I have to limit the size of the group buy, I'm going to prioritize members in the EU, since this is probably their only chance to acquire 90mm Labedas at a low price.


**Tl;Dr:** Labeda is geared towards larger production runs. Largest sample order I can get is probably 20-30 sets or maybe less. We might be able to piggyback production runs from Labeda's other clients, however color choice goes out the window.

Alrighty guys, here's the gig. Lowest we can get as a 1-off deal is 650 wheels (163 sets) minimum. I'm told they can't control the quantity, so I may have to buy another 100 sets on top of that. Wheel color is a Black Urethane wheel with a white core.

**So to reiterate:** Have to order around 650-750 individual wheels (163-188 sets of wheels). Color choice that is available is black wheels with a white core.

So it is either 20-30 sets (small manufacture) order or 160+ one? Or 20-30 sets is now out of the question?

I don't think there's are that many 'tiffany' guys as there are 'just not straight black' guys. I think Black wheels on a white core is a good middle ground. And no I didn't choose that color, that was just a lucky coincidence on Labeda's part.

Some online sellers are asking about the wheels, so I'm going to see if I can get a handful more sets moved that way. We'll need to reserve about 150 sets and then I can cover the rest.

We can still do 20-30 sets, but I want to see if we can somehow breach that 150 unit threshold. I probably can if word passes around enough.

I’m still in for a set and a set of pulley. I didn’t want black as it is boring and there are black 90mm wheels out there but I know it will make a lot of the people not so butt hurt about possibly not getting black that were crying earlier in the thread.

Okay so here's an idea that's probably gonna be **very** unpopular. If I increase the price per wheel set by 5 USD, then that'll allow me to lower the group buy threshold to somewhere around 100 or so units. I'll just have to eat the cost on whatever 'extra' wheels Labeda ends up producing. Creating a poll to see what people think of the idea.

[poll type=regular]
* Increase wheel set price by $5, only need to reserve 100 sets for the group buy to happen
* Wheel set price stays the same, need to reserve 150 sets for group buy to happen
[/poll]

I feel like if we get the word out we could definitely get some people in on it maybe psycho or LHB would jump in it doesn’t seem fair to raise the price and then you have to eat the price of the extras why don’t we try to get 150 sets and if we can get close to 150 then we will go the other route. We did get a new member who makes the hi5ber maybe he would be in for some sets. Torque board sells flywheel clones and but level clones so they could offer both since they offer both pulleys

Well technically I get to profit for the extra sets (assuming I can sell them) :stuck_out_tongue: . Even then, I'm doing this group buy for the community more than anything else.  However, if there are other estore owners here who are interested in selling these wheels and seeing how that goes, please join the group buy! Every bit helps!

I'd rather a sweet colour than black so it looks like tiffany is the winner from the poll!

When would it all arrive? need me some wheels.

@JLabs , Is it a full pully kit with belt and motor pulley wheel too?
If it's being shipped from you could I also buy a motor mount, and 6374 motor - if they are still going for $109.
Could you PM me a price for that lot?
Will i get stung for import tax when it comes into the UK?

A Pulley (for $24) only includes the 15mm 36t Pulley and the retaining ring. It does NOT include a belt or motor Pulley, tho I will have them available. 

I will PM you about the rest of the stuff so I don’t clog up this thread.

I'm still in for 1 set.  But noticed the spreadsheet didn't have me down for 2 of JLabs' pulleys.  I'll need those as well.

If you get in in the group buy you get BKB pulleys, otherwise don't commit to the group buy. Don't be the guy that screws it up for everyone else.

Maybe @JLabs could supply the US pulleys and @e.board_solutions could supply the Europe pulleys. This way the European buyers don’t have to do the expensive shipping from US to Europe.

So I did a pre order of @JLabs pullies so if you could take me off of the list for those as I will probably get them before we finish this group buy.  Labeda just did a the Boa wheels 90mm and they are selling for $80.  They did come up with their own thane formula so it isnt the same thane but it is the same hubs and poured by the same company so basically half priced Boa wheels.

Where you see this... Because 90mm hatchlings are $80..

So not sure how that's half price. When your talking 90mm..

![Screenshot_20180522-182357|281x500](upload://jeeO0Nxzc5IcTnePZdQsCQTupF.jpg)

The constrictors(100mm) are $120...

Same hub but offset core vs centre set for the std laebda wheels.

They are half the price of the hatchlings for these 90mm.  There  are some differences like thane formula like I said and like @captainjez said it is about tue core setting. But for guys looking for a quality wheel at a really good price it makes since because the only other options are Ollin’s and the hatchlings that are bigger then the kegel.
