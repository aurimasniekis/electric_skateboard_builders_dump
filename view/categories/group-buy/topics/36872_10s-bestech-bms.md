there 40usd each then 40usd shipping paypal fees
470usd into euro 388e +23% =477.24/10=57.724+10e shipping back out of here
```

## \#32 Posted by: Moros Posted at: 2017-11-04T22:53:09.477Z Reads: 105

```
For a comparison
With the group buy
BMS = $39USD x 10 = $390
Shipping = $38
5% paypal fee = $21.40
So total is $449.4 for 10 units.

Convert that to euro is ‚Ç¨388.  VAT at 23% is ‚Ç¨90 making the total ‚Ç¨478.
That brings each BMS to ‚Ç¨47.80 then add another ‚Ç¨10 euro for shipping within Europe.
Making the total delivered ‚Ç¨57.80.

A single order with minimum 2 would work out at:

BMS = $39USD x 2 = 78
Shipping = $38
5% paypal fee = $5.80
Total $121.80USD

Converted to euro is ‚Ç¨104.82. VAT at 19% (I'm in Germany) ‚Ç¨19.91 making total ‚Ç¨124.74
That brings total cost for 2 units to ‚Ç¨62.37

I'm not from Germany and my German is not that great so I'm not 100% sure on how it works or if there are extra duty fees.  Last time I ordered something from US it had a value of $50USD and the DHL driver wanted me to pay him ‚Ç¨45 to cover the VAT, duty and a ‚Ç¨15 DHL fee for covering the VAT for me.

So even with lower VAT and direct delivery, total cost would work out more and you would have the hassle of having to resell one of the BMS.

So while the price is high, unless you have a way to get around the VAT, it is still cheaper than buying it on your own.

Was this from the German office?
I bought a couple from China but got hammered for import duties.. If they could ship from Germany this might bring some of the cost down?

"Hello Ben,
 
If the order quantity reach 50pcs or more, it would have discount.
 
No, we don't have stock in our office in Germany so far.
 
If you perfect want to  purchase this module from our Germany office, I'll recommend our colleague for you, you can purchase from our Germany office directly."

@hornet90
Thanks for the speedy reply! :smiley: 
7 euro is fine. Fair enough, I understand how a group buy works you definitely don't profit.... 
especially considering the time your giving for free.
But with the BMSs your estimate of 57-60 + 7 post = ‚Ç¨67?... 
I was just wondering once ye ordered them how long would they take to reach ireland. 
Even so, it looks like you'll be waiting a long time for 50 people :wink:
Thanks again! :grinning:

So how much cheaper prices and faster shipment do you get when you have bestech deliver to California for example? I also need a 10s bms in the near future and my brother travels to LA quite often with lots of extra space in his suitcase :)
So if this is of any help, I can have him bring them over and ship them to you guys from Munich. If this doesnt help then please count me in for your order!
