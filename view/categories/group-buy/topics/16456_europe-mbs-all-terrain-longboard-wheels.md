Probably similar price to be honest

10-20 Sets - 15% OFF RRP
 21-30 Sets - 25% OFF RRP
 31+ Sets -  40% OFF RRP

If we all pay together @Michaelinvegas surely we can get that 40% discount which would be major

With 40% off, that's around 45 euros, isn't it? :open_mouth:

Done, I've marked as green but not too fussed. Whatever is easiest. If anyone can suggest a pulley to go with these I'd be in for one too.

I could provide you with a part, or someone else could print it for you. But dont these work on ABEC type pulleys?
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: Michaelinvegas Posted at: 2017-01-23T19:54:45.787Z Reads: 117

They should fit the abec type .. think it's the same pattern....but please note it is a 100mm wheel, you may need to adjust some things based on your set up

Doesnt really look like a perfect fit.
That may cause an issue with a belt alignment.

That's a good price in itself for that kind of wheel in the UK, but I guess it'd be pretty good to conservatively second guess the kind of shipping and taxes we'd end up paying.

Easiest thing for them to do is to give us a coupon code that will deduct the price down to $52,46 on both their .eu and .us site.
Then there would be no hassle with forms etc.
