I want to order things from them to Switzerland, Iâ€™m sure we could fit a whole lot more into the box. EU guys, do you need anything? Only items under 1kg, so shipping stays at CHF 23 around EU.

A few have already expressed interest so post here what you are looking for, and I'll let all you know through PM what the final prices with shipping and other fees will be : )

@Acidfie @Acido @trancejunkiexxl @moon @briman05 @Jammeslu let me know what you guys wanted
