# Group Buy Rules:

We will be collecting orders for the **whole November** month and will start manufacturing these drives and hangers in **December**. 

The group buy will operate in the FIFO principle. **First orders will be shipped first**. There is no minimum required amount we just want to gather many orders to be able to make them in single batches which would reduce cost and time of machining.

**First shippings expected after New Year or earlier if everything goes well.**


More information about Gear Drive & Hanger development can be found in the original topic. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fatboy-mini-urethane-gear-drive-1-2-8-2-6-2-4/61387/91

One of the example projects using gear drive and hangers is @mackann crazy Quad wheel driven build:

Let me get this out of the way early. 230 is fine, 240 is for style?

And is 1:2.6 the goldilocks °just right° ratio for balanced torque and speed? (similar to same ratio on belt drive?)

EDIT 230 is enough for 2x6374? Even sk3?
```

---
## \#5 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-11-03T00:03:51.117Z Reads: 485

```
Well 230 is more than enough for 6374, 240 is for 6380 probably and just for more stability (more similar to trampa wide wheelbase) 

1:2.6 I think would be more than enough torque wise you will feel like you got more torque with gear drive than belts :)

Should fit SK3 on 230 for sure :) This is normal 6374

# Also if anyone wants RAW finish it's also possible just leave the note in order and PM me :)

Kugs, a single hangar is the same price as a full set of precision SR TKP's with bushings, 7 colour options, spacers and custom engraving. 

I like the direction you're going here but no mate.

Yes, I understand :) I just tried to explain where the price is coming from :) It is not cheap to produce these kind of things at low amounts, as these hangers require more than 3 axis and precision, have a whole box of 0.5mm offset axle hole hangers which don't work correctly as they should geometrically

Well our 230/240 means 230mm/240mm hanger width without axles :)

The shaft of the 6374 motor of the torque board looks quite long.
Also, what is the recommended grease?

Yes, almost all motors will require shortening the axle. Exact length I will know later on :slight_smile:

Regarding grease our local lubricant specialist recommended to use spur gear box grease like this:

Is the motor keyway this size?
3mm x 3mm x 20mm
It seems to be difficult to install with this size.

Is the motor of the alien power system easier to install than the motor of the torque board?

We use industry standard 3mmx3mm keyway, but I think 20mm will bit to long :)

Both motors are same way to install :) You will just need to cut off the axle.

Can these be used with pneumatic tyres too and im guessing its not ideal to use 97mm wheels? Might have sell my abecs for another  set of abecs lol .. will these be useable with 110mm and up  urethane wheels?

It is made for 107mm abec wheels, on lower size you will have not much of clearance.

This is only for urethane not universal kit, pneumatic wheel hubs are bit too big for this gear drive.

If anyone is interested in FatBoy Mini + FatBoy SR hanger buy it now with original hanger after FatBoy SR will be finished it will either be the same price or require additional payment as the group buy buyins end up in November and I don't think I will have an example ready by then.

EDIT: After group buy price will be back to original before it :)

@Kug3lis will you take a picture of wheels mounted onto one of your hangers without drives?

I am trying to decide if I want to use a Fatboy for the front truck or just run a SR on the front.

Sorry if this is already posted up somewhere else.

Want to see if wheels look goofy on it with the longer axels and spacers and no drive train.

Okay will try to ask but we never intended to run FayBoy hanger without drives on it so it will require spacers the same way the TB218 needs :)

Also if you want to get FatBoy Mini Gear Drive with SR Hanger + Additional hanger (you can purchase additional hanger later on when exact price will be)

EDIT: the one who already purchased drop me a message.

I have to buy another hanger anyway as I just have those adjustable baseplates and didn't get SR hangers yet.

Ugh. Lawd have mercy. Right now I just don't see it is necessary on a street build.  The gear drive dual alone is a vast torque transfer increase.

I mean, I can see on an all terrain board, but on thane?

Are you really going to notice close to a $1000 increase in performance?  On a thane gear drive build?  

I am going to be running 170kv motors on these and the 2.4:1 ratio.  I plan using those TB 6380s (in raw like the parts I an ordering).  That little 10mm collar at the base of the motor is no issue right?  I don't see why it would be.

Also, @Kug3lis,  can we request kegal core so we can run the new TB 110s?

Hi @kug3lis, i want to use my Torque boards 6374 motors with your mini gear drive. The motors have a short 10mm section on the shaft then it goes down to 8mm. When i ordered i selected the 8mm axle option. Does this mean I'll need to drill out the motor spur to fit the 10mm motor shaft section? Thanks.

Whew. Barely made it.  Thanks for the patience!

It was hard deciding between the mini and the nano.  

Ultimately it was the 2.4 gear ratio of the mini that did it for me!

Has anyone else had problems getting the outer cover to fit over the motor gear? My cover is about 1mm from touching the baseplate at the motor end. I’m using tb 6374’s. Does the circlip on the motor axle need to be removed? ![image|666x500](upload://wzGzua6mhJF5z5GxfFefTw4lWBe.jpeg) ![image|508x500](upload://mjD15yw0VqaOasdyXb5LDyVUv4A.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://Qrwf1npPJYZZbBfocO9jFyDzQT.jpeg)

I know this isn't a nano it's a mini and they said on a tb218 only 6364 I think I got a 6380 on sale and it fits fine should have bought two dammit ..duel is next I got the room.. and I also read that you can't fit much under a falcon with eboosted enclosure to tight ..must go with Evo 40..well nope I got it all nice up in there with enough play till wheel bite.. 1/4inch riser only and waiting on those tb 6inch pneumatics ..

Mine is a mini as well on a fatboy 240 hanger.


It fits no problem at all, but I am running my adjustable baseplate at 20 degrees to accommodate the nose and tail of the Lacroix.

The reason bigger motors don't fit is it won't clear the baseplate on hard turns, this is due to the super low baseplate angle I am running though.

Mine is weird setup and not reflective of a normal use scenario.

This is very true.. love the build .. I think this deck looks better then the last if I remember..more life in the wood grain. not sure tho.. 
but I just wanted to chime in and say I got bigger motors on my set up then what I was reading and told by kugs it won't work and told falcon is to small..so the second 6380 is coming for it soon..

AT and Urethane version are two different gear drives, AT motors are more further from hanger so its not an issue to mount 6374 maybe even 6380 (haven't tried) the problem is with Mini Urethane as its next to hanger and it touches baseplate when it turns (width wise it fits perfectly)

It is screw through the yellow gear but in the hub adapter (black anodized AL) so yes, you could use loctite 243. In any case, I did it, everywhere on alloy parts screw .
