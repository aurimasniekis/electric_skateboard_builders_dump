Hello peeps

OK.... @massive-attack hit me up asking about the Raptor 2 group buys we had going on via KickStarter....Well, that done (except for me squaring up small amounts and addresses)

But... there is a bulk pricing listing....

Are there more people like @massive-attack that want in that missed the KS and want some sort of discount?

Reply BELOW. 

Below are the available bulk discount rates for each individual item when you purchase a certain amount

Buy 2 - 5 and pay only USD1,089.45 each
Buy 6 - 10 and pay only USD1,039.34 each
Buy 11 - 20 and pay only USD990.00 each
Buy 21 - 100 and pay only USD940.65 each

@massive-attack you're deep desire for a board is a little funny...but understandable...I think you needed have purchased a board direct from Enertion and be a certain number that purchased to be included in the VIP club...but @onloop can confirm

LOL.......welcome to the world of DIY and Kickstarters...unfortunately or maybe fortunately they cant just pump these out ...and you cant just shoot to best buy and pick one up......i know your on a budget and thats really a good thing...cause...this shit can get out of hand quick...especially if you start building them yourself....

anyway...be patient...and def take a peek at some older threads....and learn a little of the nuances of the VESC and some cool options in programing it...hey you may change your mind and just build one

These prices are good.   I have a boosted on reserve, but that probably won't ship until next month.   

I'm very torn since I can almost buy 2 raptors for the price of 1 boosted v2 dual+ (and extended battery).... but boosted is US based, great support, bamboo deck (I like the flex), transferable warranty, 

**If I can get a R2 for around 1k USD.... I'm IN.** 

**Hit me up with a PM.**   I've never done a group buy and not sure how you securely handle funds (also, does each individual get a warranty?  or is only the ordering person getting them)... those are the type of questions I have.

Hummm not sure... trampa urban street carver + 2x vesc 6 + battery (doesn't come with the board) + other stuff (connector, cable, enclosure) = 2500 (approx)

Those thing aren't cheap toys ðŸ˜œ

@monkey32 I've told him he could actually build a raptor 1 himself sans the carbon fiber deck which would make it even cheaper.....But he's on a budget....so Trampa is out .... but now you threw that in his face and I bet hes looking that shit up right now tearing his hair out lol

but I just posted this up to see if there are people in need of this specific board

Someone backed out of my group buy. I have a kickstarter board at 899. If someone wants to get the board when it's released send me a PM. Depending on if the battery upgrade happens, it's should be around 950 (including PayPal fees).
