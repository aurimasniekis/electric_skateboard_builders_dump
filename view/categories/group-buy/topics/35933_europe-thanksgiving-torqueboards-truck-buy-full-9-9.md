Hola ladies and Gents,

I will be doing a small (I hope) group buy of Torqueboards extended truck while home for the giving of thanks. 

These will be at cost plus 17 euros  European shipping - these are heavy and I cant afford losing money on group buy shipping any more.  

I will be in communication with Dexter to see if we can arrange some type of bulk discount. If you are European and would like to avoid trans-atlantic shipping and stupid import/ export fees please PM me and I'll start a Google Sheet with your names and payment status/tracking number ect.

As of this morn:

Me
@banjaxxed PAID
@tux-scooby PAID
 @zeah PAID
@rojitor PAID
@Youssless PAID
@sMATTEr PAID


are all in.These will be shipped late Nov./ Early December.

Nice job peeps looks like I'm hauling back 7 sets of trucks from the states.

I will take payment via PayPal:

monkey32@uw.edu

I lost some monies last buy and don't want to again so im bumping up price 2 euro each to make sure I don't short myself. 70 euros even ...... If the difference to ship to you is more than 5 euros I will refund the difference, otherwise consider it a beer for a eskate  bro trying to hook some friends up.Please include your forum name, shipping name and address in a note in the PayPal order.
```

Gentleman, you are in or out. These are to be brought back to Europe. I'm not spending my Thanksgiving shipping stuff while I have paid for a return trip to Florida from Spain.

Please PM me if you are European and would like a set of extended trucks.....the bulk discount will just be a potential perk IF I CAN!

Depends on the responses to the following questions..........
1))what's the deck 
2) do you mind paying more for shipping in Europe
Bigger box /higher weight 
3) do you mind paying me for this service 20 euro ferry service

Alright gents, conversed with senior Torque and have prices.


50 euros per set 
+ 15 euro shipping 
+ 4.5% PayPal fee ( if no friends and family)
Comes out to 68 euros per set shipped. 

This is more 20 euros less per set than if you ordered individually directly from DIY electric skate to Spain and then you are also saving yourself import taxes ( usually  euros 6-15 euros).
So I guestimate 20-30 euro savings per pair.
