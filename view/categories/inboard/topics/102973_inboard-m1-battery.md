Hi guys, i'm new on esk8. I have Inboard M1 and 2 original batteries. And i got max distance ~ 12 miles in intermidiate mode. I read that battery not good, and thinking that it's ok because: different weather, temperature, torque and riders weight. My Inboard goes 210 miles in total with these batteries and all batteries died. I'm thinking that it's very strange and unnormal. Because all 18650 elements sustain ~200 cycles charging/recharging. But Ok.I bought the Samsung 25R and replace original LG HE4, but interesting things start happening. I resoldered all original HE4 by the original Samsung 25R. Native BMS was saved. New batteries 100% genuine. 
But as result, I got max distance ~ 10 miles. And a few days ago inboard won't turn on with those batteries, indicator said “discharged". Changer won't charging batteries too. I'm thinking OMG, but my words sound more unformal and powerfull. I disasemble batteries and descovered – almost all batteries has 3.72V, but one of  3.5V. I soldered charger directly to this cell and charge it ro 3.72V. After this manipulation charger start charging and when it's done I repeat measures. I was surprised – all cells has 3.92V. I rode one week, and desided to measere discharged batteries. I'ts almost killed me. All cells has 3.5V! By datasheet Low discharge border is 2.5V, max charging border 4.2V. 
I reality PowerShift BMS not charging higher 3.92V-3.93V by cells. And not discharge lower then 3.5V. BMS not uses full cell capacity. I will make new battery with 20700 cells with BMS for Native chagrer. If someone wants to join – welcome. As u see my english is bad, because i live in Belarus, country near Poland and Lithuania.

Today each cell on fully charger battery show 3.8V. WTH?!?

Thinking that main reason why Inboard has bad battery – is bad BMS!
