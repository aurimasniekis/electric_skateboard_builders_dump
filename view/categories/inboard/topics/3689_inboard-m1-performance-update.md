Battery is tiny..it's not gonna be nowhere near 7-10 miles. In real life with dual hub's I'd rather expect ..more like 5-7. Maybe if your lucky 7-8 miles in eco mode. 
STARY at the moment has very good stats for it's one hub motor - In mode 2 - which is 16mph you can get around 8-10 miles.

I was told by an M1 owner that he needs to replace a fully charged battery after making up a quarter mile 10% grade. that's what a 10s1p pack gets you

The 40% torque upgrade is super noticeable, but I’m getting under 5 miles in range in one battery pack in pro setting. Hopefully they’ll come out with a stronger battery pack in 2019

What was your range before the 2.3 firmware update?
